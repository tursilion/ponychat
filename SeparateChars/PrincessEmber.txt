Dad, look at him.
He's just a runt.
Besides, he doesn't even wanna compete.
Let him go.
To prepare for the Gauntlet.
But I'm smarter than most of these boulderheads and you know it!
[growls]
I hate when he does that!
[coughing]
What do you think you're doing?
Did that seaweed just talk?
Ponies?
What are they doing here?
Friends?
Dragons don't do friends.
Whatever.
I don't care as long as none of you get in my way.
I have a Gauntlet to win.
I don't care what my dad said!
I'll show him and every dragon who thinks I'm just a little princess there are better things than being big and strong!
[gruff voice]
Uh, that's just me.
I, uh, robbed some ponies on my way over here.
Why did you cover for me?
You could've had one less competitor.
Yikes...
That looks rough.
But that's what makes it a challenge.
Hey, you, little fella!
I've thought about it, and your plan makes sense.
Let's do it.
Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do.
[yelps]
I think we go through there.
Listen, Spike.
I wouldn't have made it this far without you.
So I guess, if you want to, we could keep working together.
I mean, just until we get through that tunnel.
Wait.
How did you two get through?
Nothing?
You just risked everything to save her!
And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you!
Not really.
Unless I count you.
[beat]
Which I don't!
Because we were only helping each other get through the tunnel, and now we're through the tunnel, so that's it.
Well, there's only one winner, one scepter, and one Dragon Lord.
So I guess it's every dragon for themselves.
Maybe if we were in Ponyland, but like I said, dragons don't do friendship.
That's what friends do!
And I am.
I mean, we are.
I never should have left you back there.
Agh, please don't make me talk about my feelings!
Spike!
Get the scepter!
[grunts]
[straining]
These dragons do!
[grunts]
The Dragon Lord.
Dragon Lord Spike.
Dragon Lord Spike.
Hm, has a nice ring to it.
What?
You're the Dragon Lord now.
You sure about this?
Well, you'll have at least one friend here too.
What are you doing?
I don't know if I like it.
But...
okay.
I know you didn't think I could do it, but I did.
I'm not big and strong.
I know.
But you know what?
I won anyway.
So maybe it takes more than just being big and strong to be a good Dragon Lord!
Thanks, dad.
[to dragons]
Agree with him!
Just kidding!
That's not gonna be my thing.
[laughs]
Starlight!
You ready to do some death-defying dragon stuff?
