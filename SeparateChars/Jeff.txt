Do you need to sit down?
R-r-right, I’ll explain.
We’re gnomes.
First off.
Get that one outta the way.
I’m Jeff, and here we have Carson, Steve, Jason and...
I’m sorry, I always forget your name.
Shmebulock!
Yes!
Anyways, long story short, us gnomes have been lookin' for a new queen!
Right, guys?
Heh.
So what do you say?
Will you join us in holy matrignomey?
Matri...
matri-mo-ny!
Blah!
Can’t talk today!
We understand.
We'll never forget you, Mabel.
Because we're gonna kidnap you.
The more you struggle, the more awkward this is gonna be for everybody!
Just, ha ha, okay.
Get her arm there, Steve!
Ha ha, hey, there!
Um, you know, this is all really just a big misunderstanding.
You see, your sister's not in danger.
She's just marrying all one thousand of us and becoming our gnome queen for all eternity!
Isn't that right, honey?
You think you can stop us, boy?
You have no idea what we're capable of.
The gnomes are a powerful race!
Do not trifle with the
He's getting away with our queen!

You've messed with the wrong creatures, boy!
Gnomes of the forest: ASSEMBLE!
All right, teamwork, guys.
Like we practiced.
Come back with our queen!
It's the end of the line, kids!
Mabel, marry us before we do something crazy!
Hot dog!
Help me down there, Jason!
Thanks, Andy!
All right, left foot, there we go, watch those fingers, Mike.
Bada-bing, bada-bam!
Now let's get you back into the forest, honey!
Well, don't mind if I do.
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
Whoa, whoa!
Wh-what's goin' on?
My face!
I'll get you back for this!
Do do do...
Aah!
This...

This is normal for gnomes.
Scrub scrub.
Well, well, well.
Look who came crawlin' back.
Take five, Chris.
You guys keep doin' what you're doin'.
So, changed your mind about marryin' me, did ya Mabel?
You want our help?
After you left me at the alter?
No dice!
Whoa.
Mature woman, huh?
Hey Shmebulock, get my cologne!
Is Shmebulock all you can say?
It's a deal!
Stop!
We'll do anything!
How can we serve you your majesty!
The most beautiful girl we've ever seen!
Really?
But your skin is so soft.
You moisturize, or...
Next time, do your own dirty work, come on boys!
Lift with your knees.
No, your knees.
If I go one more hour without eating, I'm gonna resort to cannibalism.
Ma'am.
Welp, back to pie.
I was this close to eating you, Steve.
Hey!
I'm short, not deaf!
