Dad.
Come on Dad.
Rrrr
You Promised!
Yeah!
Wow.
And this will all be mine?
Everything the light touches.
What about that shadowy place?
But I thought a king could do whatever he wants.
There's more?
But Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Pouncing.
[whispering] Okay
Okay, stay low to the ground, right yeah...
Aw dad, can't I come?
I never get to go anywhere.
Hey Uncle Scar!
Guess what!
I'm gonna be king of Pride Rock.
My Dad just showed me the whole kingdom.
And I'm gonna rule it all.
Heh heh.
Hey Uncle Scar.
When I'm king, what'll that make you?
Heheh.
You're so weird.
Everything.
[disappointed] Well no.
He said I can't go there.
Well I'm brave.
What's out there?
Why not?
[snorts] Yeah, right.
I'm your only nephew.
An elephant what?
Whoa...
No problem.
Hey Nala.
Come on.
I just heard about this great place.
Mom!
Mom, you're messing up my mane.
Okay, okay.
I'm clean.
Can we go now?
No, it's really cool.
Oh... around the water hole.
I'll show you when we get there.
Yeah!
Not Zazu!
An Elephant graveyard.
Shhh!
Zazu.
Be-what?
Yuck.
I can't marry her.
She's my friend.
Well when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.
Well in that case, you're fired.
Yeah.
So you have to do what I tell you.
Hummph.
Not the way I see it.
I'm gonna be a mighty king So enemies beware!
I'm gonna be the mane event Like no king was before
Oh, I just can't WAIT to be king!
No one saying do this
No one saying stop that
Free to run around all day
Free to do it all my way
Kings don't need advice From little hornbills for a start!
Oh I just can't WAIT to be king.
All right, it worked!
[smug] I... am a genius.
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
Oh yeah?
Rrarr!
Hey, let me up!
This is it... we made it.
Yeah... isn't it great?
I know, huh.
There's only one way to know.
Come on.
Let's go check it out.
Aw, man.
The little banana beak is scared!
Danger?
Hah!
I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger.
Ha ha ha ha!
The future king!
Puh.
You can't do anything me.
But Zazu, you told me they're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.
I think so.
Where's Zazu?
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Oops.
Dad I...
Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
I know.
I was just trying to be brave like you!
But you're not scared of anything.
You were?
I guess even kings get scared, huh?
But you know what?
I think those hyenas were even scareder.
Oh no!
no ...
Errrgg ...
Oh, come here...
Gotcha!
Dad?
We're pals, right?
And we'll always be together, right?
[awed] Really?
Whoa.
What is it?
If you tell me, I'll still act surprised.
Come on, Uncle Scar.
I'll go with you.
You know about that?
[meek and embarassed] Really?
Okay....
Hey Uncle Scar!
Will I like the surprise?
Little roar.
Puh!
Raowr....
Raowr.
RAOWR!
Help me!
Hurry!
Ahhhh!
DAD!
[cough] Dad!
Dad?
Dad?
... Dad, c'mon.
You've gotta get up.
We gotta go home.
HEEEEELP!
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.
There were wildebeest and he tried to save me... it was an accident.
I... I didn't mean for it to happen.
[sniffing] what am I gonna do?
I guess so.
Thanks for your help.
No where.
Who cares?
I can't go back.
Something terrible.
But I don't want to talk about it.
Not unless you can change the past.
Right.
Well that's not what I was taught.
What?
Hakuna Matata?
What's a motto?
It means no worries For the rest of your days!
You live here?
It's beautiful.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole zebra.
Any antelope?
Hippo?
Eeew.
What's that?
Eeew.
Gross.
Oh well, Hakuna Matata.
Slimy, yet satisfying.
It means no worries For the rest of your days.
Hakuna Matata
Thanks.
Man, I'm stuffed.
Pumbaa... you are a pig.
Well... I don't know.
Well... somebody once told me that the great kings of the past are up there, watching over us.
Yeah.
Pretty dumb, huh?
Nala?
Is it really you?
It's me.
Simba.
What are you doing here?
Timon, this is Nala, she's my best friend.
Yeah.
Hey Pumbaa... come over here.
Nala, this is Pumbaa.
Pumbaa, Nala.
Relax, Timon!
[Startles] She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.
They do?
He did?
What else did he tell you?
Stop it.
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was going to be.
But that was a long time ago.
Look, I'm still the same guy.
Mmmm...
Maybe you'd better go.
Timon and Pumbaa.
You learn to love them.
What?
Hey, it's okay.
I've missed you too.
So many things to tell her But how to make her see The truth about my past?
Impossible!
She'd turn away from me
Isn't this a great place?
Well, I just needed to get out on my own, live my own life.
And I did.
And it's great.
[quieter] No one needs me.
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king.
Scar is.
What?
I can't go back.
You wouldn't understand.
No-no-no.
It doesn't matter.
Hakuna Matata.
Hakuna Matata.
It's something I learned out here.
Look, sometimes bad things happen... and there's nothing you can do about it.
So Why Worry?
Well what about you?
You left.
Sorry.
You're right.
I'm not.
Now are you satisfied?
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
Listen, you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know what I've been through!
Forget it!
She's wrong.
I can't go back.
What would it prove anyway?
Won't change anyting.
You can't change the past.
Come on, will you cut it out?
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?
Who are you?
[sigh] I thought I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Errrggh!
Enough already.
What's that supposed to mean, anyway?
I think you're a little confused.
Oh, and I suppose you know?
Hey!
Wait!
I hate to tell you this, but... he died.
A long time ago.
Whoa whoa.
Wait!
wait.
Will you slow down?
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.
Father?
How could I?
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.
Please!
Don't leave me!
Father!
Don't leave me.
Yeah.
Looks like the winds are changing.
Yeah, but it's not easy.
I know what I have to do.
But going back means I'll have to face my past.
I've been running from it for so long.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
First, I'm going to take your stick.
I'm going back!
I didn't want to believe you.
I finally got some sense knocked into me.
And I've got the bump to prove it.
Besides, this is my kingdom.
Is I don't fight for it, who will?
It's gonna be dangerous.
Timon?
Pumbaa?
What are you doing here?
Yes, Timon.
This is my home.
Live bait.
Come on, Timon.
You guys have to crate a diversion.
Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses.
I'll look for Scar.
No, its me.
It doesn't matter.
I'm home.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
... are no longer yours.
Step down, Scar.
The choice is your's, Scar.
Either step down, or fight.
That's not going to work, Scar.
I've put it behind me.
I am.
It's true.
It was an accident.
I'm not a murderer!
Noooooo...
MURDERER!
Tell them the truth.
So they can hear you.
Murderer!
You don't deserve to live.
Why should I believe you?
Everything you ever told me was a lie.
No, Scar.
I'm not like you.
Run.
Run away, Scar, and never return.
Whoah.
Where do you think you're going in such a hurry?
Well, I just want you to be careful.
And remember... I want you to stay in sight of Pride Rock at all...
Hmm.
Very funny.
And stay away from the Outlands.
Zazu's right... you can't turn your back on them.
Mmm... never mind.
Just run along now.
You'll understand someday.
Go on.
And stay on the path I've marked for you!
Huh?
What?
Who?
Exactly.
Do you realize the dangers we put ourselves in?
Hey, Timon, Pumbaa... Come here.
I want you to keep a close watch on Kiara.
You know she's bound to run off.
Guys, I'm counting on you.
Danger could be lurking behind every rock.
Zira, I banished you from the Pride Lands!
Now you and your young cub... get out!
You know the penalty for returning to the Pride Lands!
Take him and get out.
We're finished here.
Kiara, what did you think you were doing?
You could have been killed today.
I'm telling you this because I love you.
I don't wanna lose you.
If something happened to you, I don't know what I'd do.
One day I won't be here... and I need you to carry on in my place.
You are part of the great Circle...
Exactly.
And you need to be careful.
As future Queen...
That's like saying you don't want to be a lion.
It's in your blood... as I am.
We are part of each other.
As you go through life you'll see there is so much that we don't understand.
And the only thing we know is things don't always go the way we planned.
But you'll see every day that we'll never turn away when it seems all your dreams come undone.
We will stand by your side filled with hope and filled with pride.
We are more than we are... we are one.
Even those who are gone are we us as we go on.
Your journey has only begun.
Tears of pain, tears of joy, one thing nothing can destroy, is our pride deep inside.
We are one.
We are one, you and I, we are like the earth and sky.
One family under the sun.
All the wisdom to lead, all the courage that you need.
You will find when you see we are one.
As long as you live here, it's who you are.
You'll understand someday.
All right... I promise.
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.
No... Kiara!
Zazu!
Fly ahead.
Find her!
Kiara!
It's a good thing I did.
I almost lost you.
No more hunts for you, not ever!
Kovu?
You saved her?
Why?
You were banished with the other Outsiders.
My father's law will prevail.
For now, I reserve judgment.
We'll see who you really are.
Kiara!
Father!
Dad... just... a little... farther...
Noooo!
Kovu...
Father... I am lost.
Kovu is one of them.
Scar's heir.
How can I accept him?
I was... seeking counsel from the Great Kings.
Silent as stars.
My father would never...
What?
How do you know what...
It's... kinda cold tonight, huh?
Come on.
Kiara... I don't want you talking with him.
I want to talk with him.
Scar couldn't let go of his hate... and in the end, it destroyed him.
Fire is a killer.
Sometimes, what's left behind can grow better than the generation before... if given the chance.
Zira.
You.
Kovu... Why have you come back?
You don't belong here.
Silence!
When you first came here, you asked for judgment... and I pass it now.
Exile!
You will not go anywhere without an escort from now on.
He used you to get to me!
Because you are my daughter!
You will not leave Pride Rock.
You will stay where I can keep an eye on you... away from him.
I know he's following in Scar's pawprints... and I must follow in my father's.
What are you doing?
Kiara is gone?
Zazu!
Find Kiara!
We'll assemble the lionesses.
Move!
Now!
Last chance, Zira: Go home.
Kiara?
Stand aside.
Stay out of this!
But... they...
Let it go, Zira.
It's time to put the past behind us.
Kiara!
Kiara... Kovu... I was wrong.
You belong here.
Let's go home... all of us.
...Standing in the spotlight!
I'm okay!
Timon?
Timon... Timon!
I gotta go.
You know, go... Bad!
Whoo-hoo!
All right!
Hey—you guys look like ants down there.
Yahoooo!
Timon?
I'm thirsty.
Yahoooo!
Timon?
Timon?
Actually, I, uh... I had a bad dream.
All right!
Good night.
Heh heh heh.
Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the warthog.
What's the matter, pops?
Had a little too much Hakuna Matata?
Oh, yeah?
Well, I perfected it.
Eww.
You don't say.
And yet, still so tasty!
Three pals and no worries.
What more could you want?
Right behind you.
Oh-ho!
Ha ha ha ha!
Sleep tight.
Nala?
Waah!
But how did you...
Listen, you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know what I've been through!
Forget it!
I couldn't have done it without you guys.
Hey, you guys are watching the movie?
