[groan]
Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
But we're on a break!
It's over here!
Mare in the Moon?
But that's just an old ponies' tale.
whoa!
Okie dokie.
Hold on.
Preci...
preci...
Threh...
Twi...
light Spar...
kle.
Got it!
Now?
Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration.
And it's like, the day after tomorrow.
Impera...
impera...
Whoa!
Okay, okay!
[inhale]
There, it's on its way.
But I wouldn't hold your breath...
[belch]
[clears throat]
My dearest, most faithful student Twilight.
You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely.
...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!
My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville.
And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!
Look on the bright side, Twilight.
The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library.
Doesn't that make you happy?
Then...
when will you make friends, like the Princess said?
Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about.
Come on, Twilight, just try!
[sigh]
Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist.
Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres.
[snickering]
Food's all taken care of, next is weather.
Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
[bursts out laughing]
Wow, she's amazing!
[laughs]
Wait!
It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!
Decorations.
Beautiful...
Not the d‚cor, her!
How are my spines?
Are they straight?
[sigh]
Wasn't she wonderful?
[clears throat]
Oh, uh, music!
It's the last one!
Well, well, well...
I'm Spike.
Well, what do you wanna know?
Well...
I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...
...and that's the story of my whole entire life!
Well, up until today.
Do you wanna hear about today?
Gyah!
No I don't?
whoa!
Huh.
Rude much?
Hot sauce.
Hey Twilight!
Pinkie Pie's starting pin the tail on the pony!
Wanna play?
It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration.
Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun!
You really should lighten up, Twilight.
It's a party!
C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!
[sigh]
But that's just an old ponies' tale.
[burps]
My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying.
Make some friends!
Uh...
We gotta stop Nightmare!
Nope.
Nope-- [continues in background]
I know, right?
Exactly.
You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time.
Nope.
Worm.
A-ha!
[munching]
What?
[burp]
[clears throat]
Hear ye, hear ye.
Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.
[burp]
Look, two tickets.
No, and I plan to keep it that way.
I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.
So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?
Hey!
Twilight, he just wants to take your order.
Do you have any rubies?
Okay.
I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy.
I think we have to try another restaurant.
I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?
You're still on that?
D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!
Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk.
See you back at the library.
What are we gonna do?
Ugh...
Warn me next time you're gonna do that.
[gasp]
Hgh...
hgh...
urk...
urk...
[burp]
My faithful student Twilight,
How come I don't get a ticket to the gala?
Hurk!
[burp]
And one for you, Spike.
[giggles]
I mean, gross, I have to go too?
[continues giggling]
Cool!
Way to go Applejack, that was awesome!
I mean-- heh.
Awkward.
[sniff]
[chomp]
Want one?
And I've got the perfect treat.
From the trash.
Just a little nibble?
Come on.
[humming]
D-aah!
[hiccups]
[chuckles]
Good one, Pinkie [hiccup]
Pie.
[hiccup]
You're always pulling a fast one [hiccup]
on me.
[hiccup]
Nnaa--
Ne--[hiccup]
--eh, don't be [hiccup]
silly, dragons are [hiccup]
fire-proof.
I wish the same thing [hiccup]
were true with scrolls.
[hiccups]
Green with envy.
Well, in your case, pink with envy.
Hey, can I blow out the candles?
Ugh.
[laughs]
Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank.
What a classic.
Mmm, who cares.
This cake is amazing.
What?
It's great, try some.
Wow, talk about a party pooper.
Come on, Twilight.
You can do it!
Ha ha!
Ya did it!
Growing magic, that's number twenty-five.
Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting.
And I think this is the best trick so far.
Hello, Rarity.
What's that?
Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache.
[laughter]
Wait!
Aw, rats!
Twenty-five, Twilight.
Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting.
I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!
Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic.
Are you kiddin'?
I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.
Augh!
Snips, Snails!
What's goin' on?
Whoa!
Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here.
Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi?
Twi?
Twi?
[clears throat]
Hey, Rarity, I, uh?
Mustache!
Yeah!
Since we all know that Twilight here is?
What?
What's wrong?
How do you know?
You didn't see it!
And besides, Twi?
[zip!
Mmph!
M-mmph!
[zip]
Please!
She's unbearable!
Ya gotta show her!
Ya just gotta!
[cries]
You show her, AJ!
What we need is another unicorn to challenge her.
Someone with some magic of her own.
Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her!
She's strong, she's beautiful, she's?
It's green.
What?
Well Twilight, guess it's up to you.
Come on, show her what you're made of.
Yes, you are!
You're better than her!
Twilight?
What are you two doin'?
The what?
Sheesh.
How can you fall for her lameness?
She's just a show-off.
Unlike Twilight, who?
Oh really?
Were you guys actually there?
But nothin'.
The proof is in the pudding.
Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!
Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?
It's not the same thing, Twilight.
You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!
Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.
But you're the best!
[sighs]
If that's the way you want to be, then fine.
Hey, guys, where ya goin'?
Huh?
Twilight!
Twilight!
You've gotta come!
Quick!
No, you don't understand, it's?
Majorly.
Nice use of number sixteen.
That's new.
That was amazing!
Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?
So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?
Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?
Oh, twenty five!
Yes!
And I think I deserve it, too.
So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?
Eh, she didn't go for the mustache.
Or...
Maybe the mustache wasn't enough.
Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?
Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard.
Or maybe a goatee.
Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin!
You can count on me!
Oooh!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
[pant]
I said come back here!
Ooh!
How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?
[sigh]
With pleasure.
Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.
Is it some sort of pony holiday?
Does my breath stink?
[belch]
Is it...
zombies?
Not likely...
but possible?
Who?
The zombie pony?
Uh, sorry.
Will do!
A curse!
How about this one?
But what if you're wrong, Twilight?
What if this really is a-
A purse?
How could it be a purse?
Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!
This is hilarious!
[laughs]
Look at all of you!
We got: Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and...
uh...
I got nothin'...
Twilight Sparkle.
I mean seriously, I can't even work with that.
[groan]
[giggle]
Nope!
Uh...
gotta stay here and look for a cure.
[gasp]
Twilight Flopple!
It also didn't mess itself up.
I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho!
You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
Or maybe I should...
[groan]
[snore]
Huh?
Whaaa!
What's going on?
I don't know.
The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but...
I have no idea where these others came from.
Oh no!
They're messing up all my hard work!
Ugh.
Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'?
Ooow, waaah!
D'oh.
I know, I know, stop fooling around.
Help!
Help...
[snore]
Huh?
Mommy?
You're not mommy.
Clean up winter?
Who cleans up winter?
Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?
It's ridiculous.
No magic...
Fuh.
I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blankie, which I think I hear calling my name.
Spike!
Spike!
Come to bed!
Ugh, it's too early.
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'.
[snore]
That nest needs to be condemned.
An outhouse?
I think we lost her.
What are you talking about?
You said you wanted to be helpful.
Now get out there.
Pwuh.
Ha ha, you are a natural, Twilight.
A natural disaster.
[laughter]
[chuckles]
[chuckles]
Uh, what's hibernation?
Long sleep?
I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the eat less food part.
[nasally]
Right, because there's no magic.
Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?
[nasally]
Well, they never had you here before, either.
Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
That's my girl, following my advice.
[yelp]
The nerve.
Can you believe her?
Come on, Twilight.
Come on out.
Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing.
That's what I'm here for, sister.
Eh, yes, ma'am.
[snore]
Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!
Um...
Uh, them!
Let the games begin!
17 seconds.
But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.
18 seconds!
Why me?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-hoa!
Whoa!
Whoaaa!
Ouch.
Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa!
And I lose.
Whoa!
[grunt]
How do I get roped into these things?
Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five.
Them!
Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.
Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race.
Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again.
Just listen: Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--
Um...
Pinkie Pie?
Uh, yeah.
I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and...
I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but...
I was just wondering...
Aw...
Forget it.
We could?
Get set.
Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall.
You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle.
Trying to prove who's the most athletic.
Yes, it...
does.
What?
So...
no fudge?
Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie!
Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!
I don't believe it.
After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack.
Oookay...
Let's get back to the race.
And Spike.
Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.
Uh...
I...
like...
pickles?
As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.
There aren't even any trees.
With the most interesting announcing.
Oh no, she di'int!
You tied!
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity Toity?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him...
He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!
Yep!
Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls.
Patiently waiting decades -- no, centuries -- for the perfect pony gown.
Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!
Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!
Come on out and take a bow, Rarity.
You worked really hard for this.
Yes!
All right, woo-hoo!
Go, Rarity!
Uh, sorry.
Nyuh!
I can't help it.
Look!
Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.
Wow!
That was amazing!
Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!
Oh no, Twilight fell!
Is it...
safe to go help her?
Ha ha!
That was amazing!
Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!
Don't worry, it's safe.
Prediction already came true.
Nyuh!
What does that mean?
Pinkie?
Have you seen Twilight?
Twilight?
What are ya doing back there?
Plan what?
Twilight?
Whoa-oh-uh!
Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?
Pinkius-whoicus?
[gasp]
Gah!
What's she doing now?
Holy guacamole!
I wonder what that means?
Hold on...
You told me that's the combo that says watch out for opening doors!
Here, let me help you.
Twitchy tail?
[gasp]
Twitchy tail!
Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall!
Run for your lives.
Ah-ha-ha!
Tail...
still twitching?
Oh no!
What does that one mean?
Oh no!
Is it about her?
Guh?
Hey!
I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?
So...
Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?
I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?
Me too.
But I'm thinkin' about it anyway.
Like, what if she exploded?
Yeah, like boom!
I know.
Can you do that?
Can you explode twice?
But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then?
ugh!
Fluttershy!
You're okay!
W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!
He-e-elp!
But Pinkie's still shuddering!
Nyu-uh!
Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?
How about a squirrel?
How 'bout?
That's too bad.
Whoa-ho!
What wasn't what?
Give what up, Twi?
Bbrrbbrrbbrr.
With pleasure, Twilight.
I know, but I...
Well...
Not really, no.
Honk.
[inhales]
Twitchy tail?
Holy guacamole!
I had nothing to do with this.
Huh.
I should think not.
What?
I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.
Oh my gosh!
Sapphire Shores!
The pony of pop!
She is awesome!
I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and ?
heh...
and not even half the pony you are.
I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and?
Eh, of course not.
But were you totally flipping out or what?
Did you find some?
Ooooo!
You look so delicious...
Hm...
I will miss you, my sweets.
At your service, milady.
[licks lips]
It's perfect.
For me.
From Rarity.
Coming!
Jackpot!
Ehe...
[jackhammers]
[babbles]
[grunt]
Run, Rarity!
Run!
Aaaah!
Got him, Rarity!
I got him!
Wait!
Rarity?
[gasp]
Rarity!
Which, what, where?
Nooooooooooo!
Yes...
[pant]
I think so.
[pant]
Aaaah!
Rarity...
woods...
jewels...
dogs...
hole...
taken...
Save her!
Sorry.
Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
They called themselves the Diamond Dogs.
They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.
Puh!
[panting]
Whoa!
Oof!
I got it!
I'll save you, my sweet.
Shhh!
Oh, Lady Rarity.
My damsel in distress.
Whoa!
Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa...
I got a bite!
I got a bite!
[yelps]
[yelps]
Oh, oh!
Ha ha, it worked!
We're in!
Now we can finally save Rarity!
Nooooooooooo!
I know!
I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
No, Twilight.
You can!
You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell.
That's it.
You did it, Twilight!
Come on!
We're coming, Rarity.
We'll save you.
Just hold on.
It's coming from down here.
Come on!
I'm coming for you, milady.
Hi-ho, Twilight!
Away!
Please, Twilight.
Just give me this.
Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!
Rarity!
You're safe!
You're letting her leave with all these...
jewels?
Hm...
Outshines is right.
Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes.
Thick scales.
Can't feel a thing.
And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world.
I'm gonna tell you two a secret.
But you have to promise not to tell anyone.
I have a crush on Rarity!
You heard her.
She vants to be...
alone.
What?
I didn't think she meant alone alone.
I did not.
I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.
Apology accepted.
I would love to.
But...
I'm a little busy at the moment.
[groan]
Do you guys mind?
I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!
Okay, fine...
Good night!
[snoring]
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Bloomberg...
Bloomberg?
Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit.
Good night.
[sigh]
[snoring]
Heeeelp!
[distant]
Heeeelp!
Stop!
Dash, Pinkie, 'sup?
Hey, no worries, I know those guys.
They're cool.
Seems they took me by mistake.
And they feel awful about it too, poor guys.
Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest.
Still don't like ponies much, though...
But you're with me, so it's cool.
Turquoise.
Mmm!
[munching]
Heh hah!
This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.
I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.
See, Rainbow Dash?
They had a good reason to?
[applauds]
All right, Pinkie Pie!
That was fantastic!
What a great song!
Yeah, right on!
Isn't there someway to stop this?
[sigh]
[munching]
[cries]
I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week.
[chomp]
Auhh...
Gross!
When did you get so cheesy?
Awesome!
A centennial celebration!
Don't wanna be late!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[sigh]
There.
Check!
Check!
I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you.
Missed that!
Huh...
The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
Right.
Check!
Ah...
Ahh...
Ahhh...
Ahhhh...
[sigh]
[huge sneeze]
Well...
Maybe someone borrowed it?
Besides, you don't need that book.
You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!
Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.
Check!
Oh, come on.
[pause]
I said come on.
Gosh.
You guys are embarrassing me.
Stop it.
[pause]
Twilight, your turn.
Oh, right.
That's enough.
[yawn]
Huh?
[snoring]
[snoring]
[snoring]
Huh?
Waah!
I overslept!
I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast!
Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight!
And what do you want for breakfast?
Oatmeal?
How about a sunflower smoothie?
Grass pancakes?
But my morning chores...
Who?
Wha...
Wh...
What do we need a junior assistant for?
I'm not tired.
I do fine on my own.
I don't need sleep, I...
Worried?
Do I look worried?
I'm not worried.
Who's worried?
Hello?
Hellooo!
Whoa!
Dude, that's creepy.
Uh...
Hi there!
I'm Spike.
I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me.
Uh, Spike?
You know, assistant number one?
I'm Spike!
And who are you?
What are you?
Who?
I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
Okay, Who, Owlowiscious, whatever.
I'm Spike, okay?
Look!
All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two.
Got it?
So, a man of mystery, huh?
I'm keeping my eye on you!
I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know?
[crash]
Well, not really, but...
You know what I mean!
That bird is out for my job.
He wants to be number one.
I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one.
Not Freaky Feathers over there.
I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!
[mocking]
He's just wonderful.
Uh, yes.
Wonderful.
He's quite...
the charmer.
Grrr!
They're trying to replace me!
I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!
...Mythological Mysteries!
I know where it is.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Grrr!
Yes, sir!
Never fear!
Spike, your number one assistant, is here!
[under his breath]
Quill...
Quill...
Where is it?
Not here...
Quill...
Quill, where is it...
Where am I gonna get a quill?
But the store is called Quills and Sofas.
You only sell two things!
[groan]
Not a quince.
A quill!
Not a quiche.
[pronounced correctly]
A quill!
[sigh]
Shoot.
Come on, chicken!
Here, chicky-chicky-chicky!
Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky!
Come here!
Ugh!
Come here!
[grunting]
Not the face, not the face!
Hey!
Stop!
Quit it!
[panting]
Spike...
to the rescue.
That's just great.
Perfect!
Sweet!
I think I'll just, uh...
finish up the rest of my chores!
Or did Owlowiscious already do them?
Well, that's fine.
Because I can just stay up all night and finish?
[snoring]
Huh?
Uh...
Well, um...
You see, I...
I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh...
Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?
[to Owlowiscious]
You set me up!
Well, two can play that game.
Not who!
Two!
Urgh!
Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it!
I've gotta stop him.
But how?
Ah...
Muahahaha!
So lifelike.
And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame.
And I'll be number one...
again!
Muhahaha!
[evil laugh]
That poor little field mouse!
Torn to pieces!
It must have been Owlowiscious!
You know, since owls eat, you know, mice.
What a terrible, terrible bird!
He must be punished!
Right?
She...
She doesn't love me anymore.
Twilight hates me.
I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely.
Could it get any worse?
I guess that's a yes.
Hello?
Hello?
What is that?
If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home!
Gems!
Mmm...
Woohoo!
[hiccup]
Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty.
I miss Twilight and the pony gang.
But she doesn't love me anymore.
So, I'm better off here, all by myself.
Wow.
Seems to be getting warmer.
The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here.
Heyah bro!
I didn't know this was your cave.
And I didn't know these were your gems, but...
we're cool, right?
Whoa, whoa!
Hey...
We're like brothers, you know?
I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon...
It's us against the world, right?
You don't scare me!
So you're big.
Really big.
And your claws are super sharp.
Tail...
extra spiky.
But, uh...
You don't scare me!
How'd you like that?
Uh...
I'd love to stay, but gotta go!
See ya!
Wouldn't wanna be ya!
Aah!
Am I glad to see you!
[sigh]
I thought you didn't need me anymore.
And that you didn't love me anymore.
I'm sorry, Twilight.
I never should have been so jealous.
And Owlowiscious...
I know now that you weren't out to take my job.
Forgive me?
Forgive me, Spike.
Hey!
How did you guys know where I was?
Oh yeah, the ketchup.
It looked pretty real though, didn't it?
Uh...
[nervous giggle]
I'm ready when you are.
Really?
Why, that's a big responsibility!
Dear Princess Celestia,
[grunts]
Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?
[sigh]
Wow!
Nice spread!
That's it?
Oh, you got it.
Okay...
uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh?
I love a sunny spring day, don't you?
The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'.
Oh, okay.
Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle.
She's a unicorn.
Good with magic.
A real brainiac.
And then you got Rarity.
Total knockout.
Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but...
eh, what does she know?
Let's see.
There's...
there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights.
Heh, what's up with that?
Confess?
I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions!
And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!
And sometimes...
when no one's around...
I do this: Lookin' good, Spike!
Lookin' real good!
W-What do you wanna hear?
Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!
Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!
Uh...
so...
[loud eating noises]
She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.
Shh!
Watch!
Come on, you guys.
Let me in!
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight.
Our hometown, Twilight!
And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!
Okay.
Great!
'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot.
I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree.
And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.
Then let's get moving!
Hyah!
Um...
I...
Whoa!
You all look...
amazing!
Yeah!
This is gonna be the best night ever.
You know why?
'Cause we're all gonna spend time at the Gala to...
gether.
Or not.
Hey, Pony Joe.
Another donut.
Another donut!
Extra sprinkles!
Hey, how was the Gala?
How was your best night ever?
That sounds like the worst night ever!
You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
Uh, give up?
[burp]
[snore]
Brrr!
What did you do that for, Fluttershy?
I...
h...
Twilight, what's going on?
Why does everybody look so...
ray?
What's happened to everypony?
The Elements of Harmony?
Oh, I know exactly where that book is.
Found it!
Ugh!
This is great!
Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!
But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?
But what about Rainbow Dash?
[gasp]
B-b-but what if she finds out I've been impersonating her?
[moan]
That won't end well.
[gulp]
Sorry, Twilight.
I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library.
Good luck with all this?
whoa!
[groan]
Can't...
ove.
The princess...
as been sending these...
ince I came back upstairs.
[belch]
Make it stop!
[groan]
[belch]
[moaning]
[moaning]
[moaning]
[belch]
Check.
Check.
Check.
Check.
Yep.
Ready!
[sighs]
Let's see...
We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop...
Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.
Cupcakes!
Whoa...
Uhhh-no!
[slurp]
Looks like that's everything!
Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist!
Uh...
check!
Ugh...
I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp!
Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week...
I don't think I could write another word!
Why?
Is that bad?
Huh?
Where it..
always is?
Last...
Tuesday?
Tuesday?
What's that now?
Oh, please!
You're the most studious student ever!
I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline.
Yeah...
I don't think she--
Why would she--
Well, why wouldn't you pass--
Twilight?
Twilight!
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!
You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.
[sighs]
Huh.
Hmm.
Huunh.
Huh...
I got nothin'.
[sigh]
This won't end well.
Are you talking to...
yourself?
Twilight?
Snap out of it!
Are you okay?
Twilight, I'm really worried.
I mean this letter thing is really getting to you.
Here.
You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic.
Why don't you just relax and go hang out with--
I'm glad you've come to your senses.
Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for.
Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh...
uh...
yeah...
I'll just, um...
[snorts]
Ugh, come on, Twilight.
We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival.
Huh?
Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village?
Uh..
[knocking]
That sounds important.
[yelp]
It's a great costume!
Huh!
Grandpa!
[chewing candy]
Mm-hmm!
[eating sounds]
I love it!
[burp]
[choking on candy]
Thanks!
I'm a dragon.
[laughing]
Spooky voice might work better if she wasn't dressed like that.
You can't talk to her!
She's Nightmare Moon!
Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.
Hold it, hold it!
How about a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right?
Perplexing Pony Plagues, perhaps?
Yes, well, I do have some talents.
Heh, say that ten times fast!
No, she's not.
She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.
Ready!
Rainbow!
Huh.
Way to go, little guy!
What's the matter?
That day.
Yup!
I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!
Don't...
you...
Spike.
Got it!
The tension is unbearable.
Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
She's...
great.
Rainbow Dash is jealous.
Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.
Already got it covered.
As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.
Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!
[clears throat]
Dear Princess Cel-
[chuckling]
This little beauty is my birthday present to myself!
It's a fire ruby!
I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!
[giggles]
Hey, you took my advice!
Just use the whole floor as one big shelf.
And totally delicious.
Sure did!
Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner.
Gosh...
You really like it, huh?
[sighs]
Then you should have it.
This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.
I will never wash this cheek again.
[sighs and laughs]
There.
Perfect!
Everything looks perfect!
A washcloth?
I don't get it.
Ah, no way, Twilight!
I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!
[gasps for breath]
It's mine!
Stop it!
Twilight...
Are those...
for me?
Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville...
I usually just get one present...
from Twilight.
A book.
Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket.
I really needed a new one.
I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful.
I wish this party could last forever.
No way!
Hi, Mr and Mrs Cake!
Thanks!
Wow!
Thank you so much!
Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake!
Hohoh, what a day!
Whoa!
Oh my gosh!
I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!
[chomps]
[muffled]
Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today.
Wow, really?
I wish every day was my birthday...
Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake.
I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat.
Hmmm, I wonder...
Hey there, Lickety Split!
That's a pretty cool ball you got there!
Did you know it's my birthday?
[laughs]
This is unbelievable!
[chuckles]
Hey, Junebug!
It's my birthday!
Aren't you gonna give me something?
You know, like a birthday present?
Well, how about those flowers?
I'll take those?
Wow, you're right, Twilight.
I don't know what got into me.
Thanks for snapping me out of it.
I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back.
Sounds good!
Bye!
[chuckles]
Who else has a present for 'Spikey-wikey'?
[hisses]
[snoring]
[yawns/hisses]
What happened?
What's happening to me, Twilight?
I went to talk...
to...
Huh?
Oh, um...
I don't remember.
Hey, can I have that globe?
You're not using it, right?
What about this book?
My arms aren't usually [voice drops]
this long either.
What's happening to me?
[snorts]
[pants]
Spike want!
Spike want!
Spike want!
[hisses]
[roaring]
Spike want!
[stomping]
[roars]
[hisses]
[grunts]
[roars]
[stomping]
[roars]
[roars]
[roars]
[roars]
[growls]
[begins to roar]
[grunts]
Rarity?
I need to tell you something!
Just in case we don't make it!
I've always sort of had a crush?
Proud of me?
Dear Princess Celestia,
Curtain in two minutes!
[sighs]
[with a faux British accent]
Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony.
It was a strange and dark time.
A time when ponies were torn apart...
by hatred!
[normal voice]
I know.
Can you believe it?
[accent]
During this frightful age, each of the three tribes ?
the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies ?
cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare.
In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather.
But they demanded something in return.
Food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies.
The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night.
And so, mistrust between the tribes festered, until one fateful day, it came to a boil.
And what prompted the ponies to clash?
'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace.
The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.
The Earth ponies were freezing.
The home of the Pegasi fared no better.
The Pegasi were hungry.
And the unicorns were freezing and hungry.
Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm.
Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became.
And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard.
Each tribe sent their leaders.
Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum.
Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane.
And lastly...
...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead.
Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster.
And the blizzard raged on.
So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds, and basically complain.
[accent]
And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land.
Nopony had ever seen paradise before.
[accent]
And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings.
Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy.
Instead of wonderful, it was wintry!
Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular!
Instead of?
[laughs nervously]
[clears throat]
[accent]
Everypony was forced to seek shelter.
They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave.
And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that.
[accent]
All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs, which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today.
Eventually, the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders, and their bodies began to thaw.
[normal voice]
And it even began to melt their hearts.
[accent]
The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards.
And together, they named their new land...
Yeah!
That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season!
Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.
Yeah, just look at me!
[kisses]
Yeah?
[sighs]
I made it for you, Rarity.
Why, yes, it is an ice cream house.
Chocolate fudge shingles...
rocky road garage...
Huh?
Twilight?
It's the middle of the night!
Why are you pacing like this?
Three A.
Eh...
I don't understand.
What's wrong?
We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?
And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...
What is that thing?
Destroy Equestria?
[yawns]
I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often.
Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.
Hey, Twilight.
How'd it go with Cerberus?
Hurrh...
[belches]
What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer.
I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet.
A paper cut?
Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up.
Just clean it out and you'll be fine.
[laughs]
I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest.
You've worn a groove into the floor!
My lectures?
Huh?
Really?
So...
no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh?
Then maybe you won't mind if I...
eat an entire tub of ice cream!
Mmm!
[muffled]
So good!
[eating noisily]
[chuckles]
Stomach ache, huh?
That's future Spike's problem.
She sure isn't!
In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday!
She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!
Wait, wait, wait, let me try!
Whoa-oa?
[belches]
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to!
It was a total accident!
You wanna see the future?
I might know somepony who can help!
It's Madame Pinkie's place.
Hey Pinkie.
Who cares?
As long as I can keep eating ice cream.
Sorry, future Spike.
You've been awake too long, Twilight.
Uhh...
I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight.
It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot.
I dunno why we have to wear these things, either.
[sighs]
Let's get this over with.
Uh, Twilight?
Isn't this where we came in?
Oof!
But how do we find the time-stopping spell?
There must be a million scrolls here!
Twilight, it's over!
It's officially Tuesday morning.
I dunno, Twilight.
I don't see any disasters.
Looks like a pretty nice day.
I don't get it.
If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?
Yeah, you do!
That's great!
Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?
[stomach growls]
Ohhh...
my stomach...
I, I think it's all that ice cream...
I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem...
but now I am future Spike.
Ohh...
Yeah.
Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
What's wrong with wearing an apron?
You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales.
Feathers.
That's one tough stain!
I don't act like other dragons?
What's that?
Cute?
Dragons aren't supposed to be cute!
Right?
Rrrgh!
Waddle?
Rrrrrggggh!
What am I?
Where am I from?
Who am I supposed to be?
Seriously?
That's all you know?
That doesn't tell me anything about who I am!
I need answers!
I feel like I'm...
I'm looking at a complete stranger.
Really?
You'd do that?
Nothing at all about dragons?
This is getting ridiculous!
I wonder if dragons cry...
It's okay, Twilight.
I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!
Waugh!
Count me out.
I've gotta get an early start!
Yes!
I'm going on a quest of self-discovery!
I need to learn what it means to be a dragon!
And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!
And I'm small, and meek...
and I like to wear aprons.
See?
This is exactly why I need to spend time with them.
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
Ngh!
Hey!
Give it back!
Whoa!
Really?
Thanks, everypony.
I know it will.
Ugh!
Nngh...
[gulps]
Alright, teenage dragons!
Now that's more my speed.
And size.
Um, excuse me?
Uh, hi.
I'm Spike.
No, it's Spike!
I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that...
Not exactly...
No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!
Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and?
Who, me?
I'm not part pony!
I'm all dragon, see?
Raar!
Nnh, I am a real dragon!
Well...
how?
[gulps]
[belches]
Uh...
Good old tail wrestling...
[sounds of exertion]
Yeah!
Maybe I am!
Alright, who's next?
Whooooooooa!
But...
I get an A for effort?
Whaaaaa!
Oof!
Wha!
Oah!
Oof!
This is my chance.
King of the ho- whoa!
Oof!
Nuh!
Oof!
[gulps]
Nuh!
Guh!
[gulps]
[screams]
Ugh...
Was I...
that bad?
Man, was that a great party.
I'm not going anywhere.
The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever.
[sighs]
Oh yeah, I'm excited.
I mean, I'm psyched.
Uh, sorry, guys!
I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater!
After the whole raid thing's over?
We'll totally hang then!
Whoahoa!
Heh...
Lucky me...
Hey, Mr and Mrs Phoenix!
I was hoping I could have a word with you?
Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually...
Hey, you bird brains!
Come and get me!
[yelps]
[continues yelping]
Huh, what have we got here?
What happened?
Uh...
Smash the egg?
It's just a defenseless egg, like I was!
And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!
I said no.
Yes, they are.
And they're better friends than you could ever be.
Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons.
Run away!
Phew, that was a close one.
Thanks, you guys.
You're more than friends.
You're my family.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Aww.
[chuckles]
Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee!
Stick with me.
I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony.
Uh...
intermission?
It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.
Isn't that like...
less than one?
What did he say?
What's that?
Actually, it was only 2.
, and?
It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado.
You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!
Look!
But he's not the only one.
Well, should we pack up?
[takes deep breath, blows horn]
You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?
[blows horn]
[yelps]
They fell apart right after this!
It's sticking at seven ninety five!
I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!
[blows horn]
[sighs]
I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed.
Aaah!
Well, do it quietly, will ya?
[sigh]
Some of us are trying to unwind!
She did one on me.
Aaaah!
[yelps and belches]
Well, I didn't!
Gabby Gums made that up!
I never said anything like that!
A-ha!
[muffled]
Twilight thought you might try to show your faces around here, so she put up a force field.
Twi...
light!
...I...
have...
Lemme just...
[deep breath]
[belch]
Oh, wait!
Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.
So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party!
I have just one question.
What's a bachelor party?
[deep voice]
I do.
Do you?
[high voice]
I do!
[kissing noises]
[laughs nervously]
[high voice]
Who, me?
[laughs nervously]
[deep voice]
Do you?
[high voice]
I do!
Oh, yeah?
Just wait until you see what I have planned for the bachelor party!
[laughing]
Twilight, calm down.
It's just a test.
Uh...
yes.
Twilight!
That was fast!
Let me guess, you got a perfect score?
A-minus?
B-plus?
[gasp]
Twilight, did you...
[quietly]
fail?
Uh, prepared for what exactly?
[grunts]
I didn't say a word.
Whoa!
Hey!
C'mere...
[fades out]
Well, that was a total bust.
[grunting]
[under his breath]
Uh-huh.
We can do that.
Twilight's doing what?
[pants]
Twilight, wait!
I'm coming with you!
I know.
I promise I won't lift a claw to help you.
Where are we going exactly?
The castle?
I hope you're right.
[pants]
Uh...
[laughs nervously]
[panting for breath]
Argh!
What?
Did you find it?
Well, isn't this where he lived when he was in power?
Whoa.
When did you learn to do that?
[gulps]
[nervous noise]
Huh, if you insist.
[echoing]
Can you see what's down there yet?
[echoing]
Yeah?
It's not good!
Cadance's magic must be fading [echoing]
faster than before!
[echoing]
Twilight?
Are you okay?
[incredibly distant and muffled]
Twilight!
[closer]
Twilight?
Twilight!
Twiliiiight!
[quickly]
I know you told me to stay up there, but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and I got worried so I came down here and you were just staring at that wall and...
I was calling your name, but I couldn't seem to get your attention, and?
What were you looking at?
I mean...
it's just a wall.
...Ponyville?
Well, how did I get...
I don't wanna go!
Please, Twilight, don't make me!
We were home.
You told me you didn't need me anymore.
You were sending me away...
What's in there?
[panting]
What if this is just more of his magic?
He makes a door that leads to your worst nightmare.
Why not a staircase that goes on forever?
Uh...
Here!
It rolled over to me when you dropped it!
[grunts]
You have to get out of there, Twilight!
You have to be the one who brings the Heart to Princess Cadance!
If you don't, you'll fail Celestia's test!
But Twilight?
But?
Whoa!
Huh!
[spits fire]
Yah!
[nervous noise]
Hey!
Up here!
I got the Crystal Heart!
[sighs]
[breathing heavily]
[to himself]
Keep it together, buddy...
Gotta stay strong...
for Twilight...
She's totally gonna lose it!
[breathes heavily]
Keep it together, buddy...
Gotta stay strong...
for Twilight...
[laughs nervously]
Yeah, I knew everything was going to be fine.
[sighs]
Try again, Twi, you can do it!
But you kinda threw her aim off...
We weren't going to turn her into an orange!
I swear!
Does this mean practice is over?
That's perfect!
Let's go!
Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then.
Shouldn't be too hard.
Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.
I'm gonna go ask.
So lemme guess.
You're the real Pinkie Pie.
I miss the real Pinkie.
Ooh, this is so exciting!
Okay, maybe not that exciting.
[blows fire]
[licks lips]
Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy, Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better since she accidentally crushed me and Applejack with a giant snowball.
Twilight, that looks amazing!
Your magic has really improved since we came to Ponyville, Twilight.
Princess Celestia's going to love it.
What's she doing here?
[yelps]
Whoooaah!
Help...
Come on, Twilight, you can do it!
Twilight?
[thunk]
Ugh, there must be something!
Twilight has every magic book there is!
Hey, everypony, look!
This book has a picture of Trixie's necklace!
It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold powers!
[reading]
You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck, it has a magical lock!
Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!
[clicking noises]
[breathes fire]
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Are you kidding?
How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?
Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either.
Really?
Hmm...
I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do!
Touch nose with tongue.
Eeeng...
done!
Play bongos on my belly.
Done!
Smell my dirty feet.
[sniffs]
[sigh]
Done!
Huh, that didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would.
What to do, what to do...
[gasps]
A hot air balloon ride!
[gasps]
Oh no!
Wait!
Runaway balloon!
Gah!
[groans]
Sorry!
[yelps]
[relieved sigh]
That was a close one.
I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest.
[yelps]
What was that?
C'mon, Spike.
Just because this forest is full of wild dangerous animals, doesn't mean that you're gonna see one!
Hehe...
sniffs]
[grunts]
[screams]
I'm running!
I'm running!
[yelping]
Wow, Applejack!
That was amazing!
I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were...
rockets!
Pow, pow, pow pow pow!
You saved my life!
[softly]
You...
saved...
my life.
Man, am I lucky you were out here.
Uh, why were you out here?
Uh...
yeah...
I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too!
So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh?
What chores?
I'll do them!
It's the least I can do!
You saved my life!
I need to repay the favor.
Yes, I do!
Applejack, you don't understand!
This is something I really need to do!
Great!
What should I do?
On the double!
Applejack said I could help you!
Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle!
Ta-da!
What?
Ohhh no.
We aren't even close to being even Steven!
Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!
Please?
Pretty please?
Pretty pretty pretty please?
Pies!
Pies!
I'm helping Applejack make some pies!
Coming right up!
[sounds of exertion]
Uh, oops, sorry, Applejack.
Lemme get something to clean that up!
Don't be ridiculous!
It is my honor and my duty!
Today's just the beginning!
You saved my life!
[belches]
According to the Spike the Dragon Code, I owe you a life debt and must serve you.
[breathes fire]
Huh, you're right.
I better break the news to Twilight.
I just hope she doesn't take it too hard...
Be right back!
Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about!
You have to do this!
It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore...
but it won't be the same...
but it has to be done.
Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves!
And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days!
I'm sure you understand.
It's...
been an honor...
being your faithful assistant.
[sighs]
She said it was okay.
So, with Twilight's blessing, I'm free to follow my code and serve you until?
Well, until forever!
Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me!
I have to be true to myself!
If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore!
Great!
Then from here on in, your wish is my command.
Rarity?
I helped bake it.
You even look good when you're chewing...
[laughs nervously]
W-who looks good when they're chewing?
Aren't you gonna have some more?
It's ten in the morning.
Ohhh.
Okay.
As you wish!
Do you...
have a broom I could borrow?
Rocks?
I am?
I do!
It is Spike's dragon code!
[sounds of exertion]
[yelling]
Is this high enough?
Haha, yeah!
You can do it!
Haha, hahah, alright, yeah!
That...
was...
awesome!
Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash?
Applejack can rebuild it for you.
And when I say Applejack, I of course mean me!
W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with?
If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon?
Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with!
Maybe not!
Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with.
Like...
maybe your back itches!
[laughs]
See?
Or you might need help remembering your favorite song!
The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure...
Or...
you might need help breathing!
See?
There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them!
As you wish.
Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five...
[in distance]
Applejack?
[pants]
You said you had something else you needed me to do?
But of course.
Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres.
You asked me to.
And, as a noble dragon and follower of my dragon code, I?
Wait a minute.
Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake!
You got the clomping on his claws...
...The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good.
But you forgot one thing: his breath!
You could smell a real timberwolf's breath from a mile?
[sniffs]
[laughs]
Too late, I'm already on?
Timberwolf!
Uh oh...
Applejack, come on!
No more messing around!
Let's go!
I have to save you!
Let's get out of here!
[grunts]
Uh-huh!
Aw, it was nothing.
Yeah, what was that all about?
Sounds good to me.
But, maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life?
Happy to help!
No, really!
I'm really really really happy to help you!
[sighs]
I wonder what's taking so long?
But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late.
[gasp]
Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!
M-m-maybe you should ask...
her!
This will never work!
This is a disaster!
How will we ever control him?
We're doomed!
Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them.
I'll do it!
Or...
let's not.
Right here, Twilight.
But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time?
What's wrong?
Hate to break it to ya, but he used that space to be himself to tear out all the reforming spells from the library!
Here you go, Fluttershy!
Game on!
[humming]
[singing]
Spike is great...
aking a jewel cake...
[chewing]
Me, that's who.
[singing]
Been saving up my gems so fine...
for a cake that is divine...
[chewing]
Who are you hooing at?
I know, they're delicious.
Now you see 'em, now you don't.
[chewing]
[belches]
[singing]
This is how you make a jewel cake: stir in some gems, and then you bake.
[chewing]
Mm-hmm!
Gonna, eat, eat it up!
Gonna?
[gasps]
What happened to all my jewels?
[drums claws]
I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't!
Which means somebody took 'em!
Who?
That's what I'm asking, who?
Who took my jewels?
I'm who.
This cake was gonna be so good!
Why?
[thump]
Why?
[gulps]
Whyyyyyyyyy?
[singing]
I have no jewels...
I have no cake...
I'm a sad little dragon...
With nothing to?
...is it?
Well...
I do have this cake to not bake...
Uh, inside joke.
Talk to me.
Oh, I know all about that.
As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming...
What was that?
[slurp]
That's a really big one.
A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel.
Yeah...
Sure...
Wait, what?
You want me to take care of him?
Uhh...
We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just...
You know...
She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching...
All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about.
[whistles innocently]
Okay, whatever.
Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me...
Critter-proofing.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
[chuckles]
Three down, three to go.
What's that you said, Gummy?
Uh-huh.
Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one.
Go ahead, ask her!
I think what Gummy's trying to say is?
I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.
Alas, it doesn't come cheap.
A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness...
[slurp]
Exercise.
Sure, of course.
Whoa!
You got it!
So, uhh...
What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours?
Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too.
Nah, pshaw.
I'll be fine.
But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the...
paying customers.
Of course.
Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't.
Piece of cake.
Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to.
[slurp]
Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about.
Relax.
Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire.
Spike's got it all under control.
Alright, sidekicks, front and center!
There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me...
Gah!
Two!
And what I say goes!
Spike, the boss of you, that's who.
One, two, three!
Nngh, come on, number four!
Whoa!
Guh...
One, two, three, four, five...
Argh, who's missing?
Angel.
All I wanted were some jewels.
Big, juicy, delicious jewels.
Now what do I have?
A missing rabbit and?
[clears throat]
[to Angel]
Look, you don't wanna be with me.
I'd rather not chase you around all over the place when I could be enjoying some jewel cake.
Watch me solve both of our problems.
[to the Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead.
Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans...
It's just, you're so good with them.
Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good?
You know what?
As hard as it's gonna be for me part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them.
If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark.
Am I right or am I right?
Yes!
It's an afternoon.
They don't need all that stuff.
They'll be fine.
Uh...
what would I possibly be doing with jewels?
Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon.
Take it or leave it.
[singing]
Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels!
Meh...
that bird could use a little color.
What have you done to the turtle?
[groans]
Alright, load 'em up.
And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you.
What?
Why not?
[groans]
I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next.
Really?
[sighs]
Where are you going?
[stomach growling]
Almost there...
Just taking good care of everyone's animals.
What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away?
[sighs]
And this is just between you and me, right?
No other pony has to hear a word about it?
This better be important.
Angel.
All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off!
Promise!
Is three ponies enough?
[sighs]
At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures.
We're not really going!
We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit!
And when I do, we're off!
There he is!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Take it!
Just take it!
Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville!
Nopony's gonna get past this dragon!
You wouldn't dare!
[giggles]
Oh no!
[gasps]
Shhh!
They're right there!
There's the bunny!
Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there!
I'll fluff your tail!
I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop!
What do you want?
Name it, and it's yours!
[pants]
[groans]
[kisses]
Hyah!
Hah!
You're coming with me!
We made it!
They're coming this way!
Everybody down!
Shh!
Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down!
Go ahead, bunny.
Do your worst.
I deserve it.
I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to.
I wasn't really thinking about you at all.
Any of you.
Just wanted the jewels.
I hope you'll all forgive me someday.
You will?
[stomach growls]
Oh great.
I'm gonna be the one who gives us away.
Where did you?
[stomach growls]
Hello!
Thought we'd meet you at the station!
Yeah, well...
we're like this now.
You know who.
Yeah, it does.
[slurps]
It really really does.
[pause]
Whyyyyyyyyy?
Of course.
Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't.
Piece of cake.
Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to.
[slurp]
Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about.
Relax.
Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire.
Spike's got it all under control.
[stomach growls]
[yawns]
I still don't know what you had to wake me up for.
I love sleeping in the rain.
What's going on?
Why is this happening?
So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back.
Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?
Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?
Well [sighs]
, maybe it won't be so bad.
Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives.
Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this.
These are your friends.
Twilight?
Are you alright?
You do?
[reading]
Dear Twilight, you aren't missing anything.
Your friend, Pinkie Pie.
Check, check, check, check, and...
check!
Huh, whaddaya know?
We're way ahead of schedule!
I credit your extremely competent assistant.
The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow.
We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event!
Uh...
so that's a 'no' then?
Your highness!
[clears throat]
I think this guy needs you?
About to call it a night?
I knew you were gonna say that...
[snores]
Check-check-check-check-check-check...
Ungh...
What time is it?
Whoa.
That is weird.
Vanished?
Way to take charge, Twilight.
Where are we going?
[gasps]
[short on breath]
Twilight?
There is another way for us to get to Ponyville, remember?
Huah!
You can fly!
[gags]
I'm starting to wish...
we'd taken the train!
Incoming!
Sweet ground!
[kissing noises]
Sweet, sweet, wonderful ground!
They're missing!
They're missing!
You sure about this?
So what did you find out?
Come on, Twilight.
Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed.
He's just trying to get under your skin.
Are we there yet?
We can't just give up.
Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em.
Well, what do you know?
Twilight?
[gasp]
Oof!
Ugh!
Twilight!
Trouble!
Help!
What's wrong, Twilight?
[yelp]
[belch]
Whoa, whoa-whoa!
Oof!
[yelp]
Uh, heh-heh.
So, uh, Twilight.
Uh, ready to head home?
[teeth chattering]
I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight.
I was really only scared for a second.
Oh, great.
Uh, nope.
Nothing yet.
Aaah!
Hall of Hooves?
What's the Organ to the Outside?
Uh, Twilight?
Did you hear something?
Oh...
kay.
Oh, you know.
Probably just more strange sounds of this old castle falling apart!
What got into them?
What's...
the Pony of Shadows?
Then who's playing...
that?
Heh, Shadow Ponies...
How ridiculous is that?
Aw, two more minutes, Twilight!
I'm just getting to the really good part!
The Mane-iac is about to?
The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis!
She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company.
A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go completely insane!
She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device!
Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it.
Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape.
The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick.
The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed!
Okay, okay, I'm going to bed.
Goodnight.
Yes!
Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part!
You sure you don't need any help?
Dash?
[sighs]
Isn't there anything I can help you with, Twilight?
Hum Drum never stops the villain.
He's just there for comic relief.
[splash and clatter]
[grunts]
I could do it!
[sigh]
[to himself]
Mane-iac breaks into the museum...
Okay, here we go.
...Ugh, what a surprise!
Hum Drum is in the way again while the Power Ponies do all the work!
I guess I know what that feels like...
[gasps]
Wait.
What?
How can that be the end?
What's...
that?
You can...
retr- What?
You can...
return...
Urgh!
I know I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here...
[reading]
You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is...
defeated.
Huh?
Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book?
What does that even mean?
Whoa!
Cool!
Heeeeeelp!
Is this...
Maretropolis?
Holy new personas, ponies!
You're the...
Masked Matter-Horn!
Fili-Second!
Zapp!
R-Radiance!
Mistress Mare-velous!
Saddle Rager!
You're the...
Power Ponies!
You're the...
the superheroes from my comic book!
It somehow zapped us all in here!
My comic book!
It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac!
Your arch-nemesis!
She could be miles away from here by now!
Pinkie is Fili-Second, the fastest pony in all of Maretropolis!
Twilight!
Freeze her mane!
You're the Masked Matter-Horn!
You can shoot all kinds of crazy power beams from your horn!
Dash!
Quick!
You're Zapp, and your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature!
Unholster the lightning bolt!
Lightning, not a tornado!
Fluttershy!
You're Saddle Rager!
Lose your temper, and you'll turn into a huge, super-strong monster!
Ugh!
Rarity!
Use your jewelry to create attack constructs!
Just think of something, anything, and your bracelet makes it appear!
Something useful!
The Electro-Orb!
I'm Hum Drum...
Oh no...
[straining noises]
Applejack!
You gotta...
help stop the...
tornado from destroying..
the city!
You're psychically connected to it!
Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!
Technically, it's called Maretropolis.
And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!
Almost all of us have superpowers...
Yeah, for absolutely no reason.
He's pretty much useless...
Yeah, good thing...
Her top-secret headquarters!
But you'd better get there quick.
That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!
[sighs]
There it is!
Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing.
The Hairspray Ray of Doom!
It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!
Fluttershy, please!
Just a little anger?
Don't spray!
What am I supposed to do?
I'm useless.
No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important.
They're the ones with superpowers.
They've probably already figured out how to escape.
Or not!
I'm not like Hum Drum!
When my friends really need me, I do come through!
And they need me now!
Fluttershy, where are you going?
Fluttershy, we need you!
You have to power up!
Once again, the day is saved by?
I'm just glad to be back.
And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend.
This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics.
Well, I didn't know it meant they were literally enchanted!
I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines!
Hey, wait up!
I'm an important part of this team, remember?
Awesome!
Did it work?
Aw, don't mention it, Applejack.
It was my pleasure!
Really!
Okay, got the part about the spell, Fluttershy turning into a bat, building a sanctuary...
There you are, Rarity!
That's the last of your bags.
Sure...
I'll be a dear...
[strains]
Whew, that was close.
Anypony else got a sneaking suspicion we're forgetting something?
Genealogy is the study of family history.
Y'know, where ponies come from and who they're related to.
Mail's here!
Going out on a limb here, but I'm guessing that Princess Cadance said she can come this weekend!
Are you kidding?
Twilight can find a rulebook for everything!
[sighs]
Sorry, Pinkie.
[straining noises]
[clears throat]
[reading]
This year's Ponyville Days festival, designed by Rarity, will feature various high-class events such as...
a silent cider auction and tasting.
A Ponyville gala in town square.
And, of course, a Ponyville fashion show.
This year's Ponyville Days festival pony of ceremonies creates shimmering couture of her own design.
Rarity?
Rarity!
Hello?
I brought my cider-tasting cup.
Are you ready to go try the samples?
Rarity, what's wrong?
Is it something I said?
What?
Rarity, I can't hear what you're?
Trenderhoof doesn't like you?
That's ridiculous!
I 'unno.
Rarity, why do you want to plow a field?
Don't we need to check on the gala decorations?
The festival.
Right.
Well, that's what friends are for!
She makes it look so easy.
[playing banjo]
Um...
Apple...
Jewel?
Woo-hoo, yeah!
Rarity, you were awesome!
Eh, the rest of you were pretty good too.
Hey, has anypony seen my?
Oh, there it is.
[whistling]
Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess?
[sighs]
[straining]
Aw, come on!
[grunts]
[hushed]
Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?
Oh, no!
Okay, okay, okay!
I know what you're all thinking!
Why don't you just say it?
[crying]
I'm sorry!
This is all my fault!
I'm so, so sorry!
Okay...
Thank you!
Uh...
I'm...
just...
gonna stay over here.
Wow, you guys!
I think your sisters would have loved it!
They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning.
Yeah.
Rarity fell way behind.
Aw, cheer up, the show was great!
I'll get you some punch.
[starts drumming, continues under]
[grunts]
Wha?
Nooo!
Thanks, Twilight.
Whew.
One ding, nick or dent, and this Power Ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore.
And if you want to trade for a mint comic, you gotta have a mint comic.
How could it not be?
[dreamily]
You're the one making it...
Your favorite dragon?
Aw, gee...
I don't know what that guy was talking about.
This thing is perfect!
So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppet theaters puppet theater.
[beat]
You can just contribute something else to the Foal and Filly Fair.
Argh, there's gotta be something in here somewhere.
It's not who, it's what!
Like, what can help Rarity make something in time for the fair?
She really, really, really wants to make a creative contribution.
She said I'm her favorite dragon, so it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need.
There's gotta be some kind of spell that'll do the trick.
Come on, help a dragon out!
Ugh!
It's not for me!
It's for Rarity!
The one who made you that bow tie you like so much?
Okay, I get it.
You don't think we should use magic?
What is that?
[blows fire]
What?
If I wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get.
And it's covered in spikes, like me.
Inspiration Manifestation: Instantly brings ideas to life.
I'm likin' the looks of this one.
Hmmm.
Rarity!
But I brought you something.
It's magic!
But not the kind that can help you create something in time for the fair.
This can!
Did it work?
As a matter of fact, she used a s?
My pleasure.
Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over.
Of course not!
See you tomorrow!
[to Owlowiscious]
What?
She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that.
[whistling]
Rarity?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Are...
you okay?
Wow!
Of course I will!
[panting]
What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started?
Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make things?
Rarity?
It's amazing!
You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover!
You're right!
Everypony does love surprises.
The...
three of us?
...Of course.
[muffled]
You got it!
She'll be fine.
It's just a dress.
Uh, wait for your favorite dragon!
It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created.
I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it.
Of course I do.
It's so...
[beat]
Rarity.
Oh yeah, definitely.
You've already made things look really really great.
Maybe you should stop while you're ahead?
Right!
Elsewhere...
That's great!
But, uh, you've been at this for a while now.
How 'bout you take a break?
Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest?
All because of you, heh...
What do you mean, not me too?
What?
This?
I just wanted to try out a new look.
You like?
Uh, nope.
I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself!
[sighs]
But you're right, Owlowiscious.
I have to tell.
And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend...
I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all...
[sighs]
I can't do it.
I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us!
Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book.
But?
The spellbook!
Of course!
If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore!
Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan!
I...
just have to figure out which way she went.
I'm thinking she's headed this way.
Uh, me?
I was just, uh...
basking in your creative radiance.
Thanks.
[chomp]
[gulps]
[gasps]
Of course you have.
You're Rarity.
Absolutely!
Oh, yeah, we should definitely go by?
Huh?
How...
how did you...
do that?
The book!
It's?
I mean?
you don't?
it's gone!
The book is gone!
Why would I do anything with your book?
We're friends!
It...
it was probably the owl!
[quietly]
I'm so scared.
...No.
I said 'no'.
You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better.
I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend.
[sighs]
But instead, I let you become something awful.
Rarity!
You're okay?
You happened.
The last part of the spell!
The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria.
I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I...
I told you the truth.
Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right.
A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them.
[chuckles]
You don't look so good.
What?
I'm just being honest!
It's what good friends do!
[straining]
It's all in there, gang!
Leave it to Spike, champion gear-carrier for all your gear-carrying needs.
In with the portable ramp!
Whoa!
Aw, she's just nervous, that's all.
Perfectly understandable.
Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget something or start to panic, I have a simple trick.
I count to ten, and by the time I'm done, I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right every time.
Easy-peasy, cider-squeezy!
Hey!
Put me down!
Huh?
Who the what now?
Uh, can they hang back a second and tell me what's going on first?
[eating]
So the ponies here think I'm some kind of hero, huh?
[to Fleur De Verre]
More of the green ones, please?
I like the green ones.
[a la Barbra Streisand]
Hello, gawgeous!
Of course I'll do it!
And ?
bonus ?
I can do it with my fire breath!
[breathes fire]
[laughs nervously]
I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal, and then I walk over and light the torch.
[gasps]
[inhales]
[coughing]
Come on, Spike!
Calm yourself!
Count to ten.
One...
two...
three...
thousand...
fourteen thousand...
Twenty thousand...
Thirty thousand...
[inhales]
[weak breath]
Tell me this isn't happening...
[inhales]
[coughing]
I don't know what it is, but I just don't have the stuff today!
Did you bring a match?
[coughs]
[raspy]
Then some cough drops, maybe?
Nevermind.
I'll keep trying.
[exhales]
[clicking]
Light!
Light!
[straining]
I'm...
not sure.
I guess.
I don't know.
The weirdest thing happened down there.
I mean, there I was, trying to light the torch, with all of Equestria watching, and feeling like the hugest failure ever, and then the thing just lit!
It was amazing!
Upset?
Are you kidding?
Why would I be upset to discover I can light fire...
with my mind?
Sure!
You know what else is amazing?
Watch this!
[beat]
[straining]
Don't worry.
Once it bursts into flames through brainpower, I'll sign another one for ya.
Promise.
[straining]
Hey, you'd better be careful with that!
It might burst into flames later!
Delayed reaction.
Hey, Twi, what is it?
Hold on, hold on, give me a second...
If I can set fire to stuff with my mind, mind-reading must be just around the corner!
And I predict that you are about to ask me...
to set fire to something with my mind!
Oh, really?
So how do you explain what happened down there in front of thousands and thousands of?
In front of...
thousands and...
thousands...
I...
I...
I need to be alone right now.
Sorry.
You should probably ask somebody special instead.
Harshwhinny?
I know you're really busy, but...
Maybe there's something else I can do for the Games.
Y'know, something really worthy of the Crystal Empire's admiration?
Uh, well, actually, that wasn't really?
Wait, that's it!
And I shall do the honor of singing!
You know how they always just play the music?
[amplified]
Well, I know all the words to our anthem, and will sing them for you now, loud and proud, to the enjoyment of all!
Wait!
The Cloudsdale anthem?
But...
But I don't know the words to the Cloudsdale anthem!
I've never even heard it!
[clears throat]
[singing out of time and rhythm]
Nah, I got this stuff to pack up.
Which means we leave tomorrow.
Ergo, the packing.
[exhales]
[gasps]
[chokes]
Uh, yeah!
I'm super-busy!
Look at all this packing left to do, heh.
Crazy, right?
Okay, fine.
I'll come.
Can I at least wear these?
I let everypony down.
Twice.
You never let anypony down, so you don't have any idea what that's like.
Can we at least watch from inside there?
I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet.
Dash, Fluttershy!
Move!
I guess.
I just saw what needed to be done and reacted.
Just so happens I can breathe fire and...
if any of you could do that, you'd have done the same.
Well, it's just how I feel.
Meh, I don't know.
Can you turn back time?
'Cause I'd sure like a do-over on that opening ceremony.
Mm, I guess I have to at least give it a shot.
You know, it's kinda weird.
No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside.
[inhales]
[breathes fire]
Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past.
That way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly, you'll be able to light up the whole sky.
Seems like only yesterday I was saving this place from being totally destroyed.
Hey, you guys remember that?
That was it?
Princess Celestia had you come all the way to the Crystal Empire just to do that?
I mean, whoa, really regal and important!
[laughs nervously]
Where are you going?
Big deal.
Don't worry, Twilight.
I'm sure you'll get your key eventually.
[sharp inhalation]
[hurk!
What's it say?
[snoring]
You weren't gone very long.
Does that mean everything's okay?
In that case, I'm going back to bed.
Sun's not up...
and neither am I.
Uh, Twilight, [pants]
where are we goin'?
[chomps]
Twilight, what were you thinking?
[snoring]
[snoring]
[groans]
Is that new?
I like it.
This is incredible!
It's got all of Equestria!
Awesome!
Me and Big Mac have a huge weekend ahead of us talkin' hoofball, and...
and trading hoofball cards, and arguing about hoofball stats...
Well, suit yourself.
But he's got a Hock Fetlock rookie card I plan to sweet-talk right into these hot little claws.
This is incredible!
It's got all of Equestria!
Oh, no!
Did I miss the pancakes?
I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling.
Really?
Great!
I've been meaning to get my claws done!
[chews pancake]
[with mouth full]
Oh, you mean now.
[chews]
Hey guys, how do my claws look?
Sweet Celestia!
Don't worry, I ordered her the super-deluxe mane blow-out!
She'll be a while.
Man, this place looks terrible!
I dunno.
But Twilight's blow-out won't take that long.
If she was avoiding the castle before, she'll never set hoof in here now!
Like, forever?
But we live here.
Anything for you, Rarity...
Great!
Great?
Great!
I mean, no!
I mean, uh, I'm not...
quite ready to go yet.
Uh, why don't we have a massage?
I was really hoping to get, uh...
this thingy!
[gulps]
Yep!
[joints cracking]
Ow...
[cracks]
I mean...
how...
nice is this day?
I was hoping we could take the scenic way back.
Come on.
Walking is good for post-massage circulation.
We did, didn't we...
Really?
I, um...
I just thought of what I want!
It's a...
well, I want a...
it's...
I kind of need a...
a bed!
[scoffs]
Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers.
Let's go!
Um...
Just right!
I'll take it!
Sounds good to meee?
I...
nn, um, uh, heh...
did you hear that?
[mimes squeaky springs]
Too squeaky!
Better keep looking!
Aw, come on!
It looks exactly the same!
Do you know how hard it was to keep her from coming back here?
I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live!
I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon!
I'm purple.
Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon!
Ugh!
Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiber?
[snoring]
Gemstones...
[snoring]
Gah!
Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping Princess Celestia with the Gala!
[nervous noises]
[licks lips]
Um, hello, everypony!
I'm here to help any way I can.
So if there's anything I can do for any of you?
[sighs]
I guess everypony loves a princess.
Hmph.
Ugh!
[muffled]
A little help?
Of course!
What can I do?
Whoa, what happened to you?
I promise!
I won't let you down!
Perfect.
Not on my watch.
Uh, excuse me?
Can you keep it down a little?
Oh, no!
I'll give you birdseed!
Worms!
Anything!
Just please stop singing before you wake the princess!
Huh.
I can't believe that worked.
Hyah!
[sighs]
Uh, hi fellas.
Sorry to break up your game, but there's sort of an important diplomatic summit kind of thingy going on, and it involves a princess needing to sleep, and, uh...
maybe you could move your game somewhere else?
Uh, the princess thanks you for your understanding!
Excuse me.
Do you have to do this right now?
[sneezes]
Oh, no!
Are those dragon-sneeze trees?
[sniffles]
[strained]
Can't you just wait a few hours?
Well, I've got my orders too from Princess Twi...
Twi...
Twilight...
[sneezes]
Huh.
Good thing I've got the princesses on my side.
[vibrating yelps]
Aw, come on!
Excuse me?
[shouting]
Excuse me, sir!
I really need you to?
[jackhammer stops]
stop right now!
Oops.
Ugh, you couldn't do this yesterday?
But there is no summit without Princess Twilight, and she needs things to be kept quiet around here.
So if you don't mind, I'd?
Hmph!
Princess Twilight will be rested, Princess Cadance will be proud, and Princess Spike deserves a little reward.
Hah!
Princess Spike.
[laughs]
[licks lips]
Uh, hi.
Can I help you?
Uh, can you talk a little quieter?
And maybe come back later?
[sighs]
Lemme see what I can do.
[squeals]
Oh, uh, yeah.
Two delegates have speeches booked in the same hall.
What do I do?
Huh?
Oh, I need an answer, but Twilight can't even think straight!
Oh, my gosh, what am I supposed to do?
Um, she said that...
Well, she said that she...
she wants you to...
share it?
[sighs]
Now, back to more important things!
[chews]
Huh?
B-but?
Uh, by order of Princess Twilight, be quiet!
[echoes out]
Your friend took your seat?
Hah, big deal!
Why don't you just?
[sighs]
Fine.
Uh...
The princess says no friendship should end over a seat.
You should forgive your friend!
I could tell these delegates anything as long as they think it came from Twilight.
[beat]
Alright!
Who's next?
So, how can Princess Twilight be of service?
Well, that doesn't seem fair?
I mean, Princess Twilight doesn't think that seems fair.
This is great!
I just took care of a whole bunch of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up!
Wonder if anypony else needs the princess's help?
If I can check a few of these meetings off Twilight's schedule, then when she wakes up, she won't have to think about anything but the reception.
Uh, it says here you have a meeting with Princess Twilight?
Okay, go ahead.
Well, if it helps, you can call me Princess Spike.
No-no-no, it's alright.
The princess asked me to take care of a few things for her.
That's why I came to find you.
The princess says so!
I'm here for your two o'clock!
I speak for the Princess.
Actually, Twilight still needs her rest, and her no-noise policy is still in effect for a few more hours.
Sorry.
Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down!
Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't have to worry about them when she wakes up.
Nah, don't worry.
I got it covered.
I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her!
Well, why else would I be doing it?
Enjoying it?
[laughs]
No way!
The only things I'm doing by order of the princess are for the good of the summit!
[laughs to himself]
[sighs]
[vibrating]
By order of the princess.
By order of the princess!
[chews]
[through gritted teeth]
By order of the princess...
[sighs]
Princess life is good!
[chews]
Eh, it's not so bad.
What are you talking about?
I'm a great princess?
I mean, Twilight's a great princess!
And I've been working hard to help her!
When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship!
I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to!
I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep!
And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue!
I'm a decision-making master!
[sighs]
Okay.
So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions.
But it's not like anything bad happened.
This is unexpected!
At least the statue's okay.
[sniffles]
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
[sneezes]
Oh, bless me...
Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, and?
Please, everypony, listen!
I'm so sorry all this happened!
Please!
You've got it all wrong!
[panting]
Wait!
I mean, [hushed]
wait!
It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we?
[panting]
She is SLEEPING!
[sighs]
Uh, you seem well-rested.
You haven't?
Well, at least I got one thing right.
And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me.
Maybe I did do a good job today!
[yelps]
Um...
you needed to sleep.
And Princess Cadance told me you weren't to be disturbed.
And there was this bird, and, well...
long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf.
Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good intentions!
Honest!
Until I...
didn't anymore.
I'm sorry, Twilight.
I guess I got a little carried away.
It-it just felt so good to have ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters.
I guess I was just enjoying feeling like a princess.
How do I do that?
[sighs]
Uh, hi there, everypony.
So I guess I owe you all a pretty big apology.
It's funny.
Here we are at a summit that brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think about was myself.
You all came here to celebrate the things that make each of our cities so unique and special.
But instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to make myself feel good.
Does this mean you forgive me?
[sniffles]
Aw, come on!
[inhales for a sneeze]
[blows trumpet]
[sighs]
When Twilight told me to stall?
I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could?
[sighs]
You know the worst thing about you being the Princess of Friendship?
The dishes.
It's kinda funny, isn't it?
All these ponies comin' to you for advice about friendship?
You know, 'cause you used to be famous for being such a bad friend.
Come on, Twilight.
Look at the wall.
D'ya see any photos from before we moved to Ponyville?
And look at you now ?
the Princess of Friendship.
Well, I only meant that you've come so far.
You're a great friend now and?
Me and my big mouth.
Come on, Twilight.
You're getting worked up about nothin'.
And here's that present I was gonna give Moon Dancer!
Huh.
Guess she won't be needing that.
Hey, look!
The rest of it's still here!
Come on, Twilight.
Princess Celestia gave you an assignment.
Nopony could blame you for that.
Uh, Minuette, Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts, Lyra Heartstrings, and Moon Dancer.
[snoring]
[groans]
Have you been awake all night?
Uh, it's not too late to forget I opened my big mouth.
Let's hope they're not as traumatized as Minuette.
[sighs]
Come on, Twilight!
We've been watching her for three days!
Library, house, library, house.
That's it!
[inhales]
Twilight, are you all right?
W-Where are you goin'?
And what are we gonna do?
Um, Moon Dancer?
It got kinda banged up, but here's a little something I wanted to give you back at your first party.
Huh.
I wonder why I didn't have that nightmare.
I slept great!
Sure!
All set!
[blows fire]
Not me!
Whoa-whoa-whoa.
So what you're saying is...
you dreamt about all of them, and not me?
[whimpers]
I know you said nopony can help, but I'm no pony!
I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case!
What happened?
Are you guys okay?
But Luna caught it, didn't she?
[snoring]
[clicks fingers]
Well, if you're gonna dream, might as well dream big, right?
Hi-yah!
Am I crazy, or did it just get even bigger after Luna said that?
Poof!
Huh.
Wonder what she's dreaming about now.
But you're reading.
And...
Uh, Twilight?
[scoffs]
And check out all these old comic books!
[blowing]
[nervous whistling]
You'll feel so much better once you get it off your chest!
Now can we open presents?
It's kinda like our tradition!
[straining]
Just what I always wanted!
A book...
You think it's scary now, just wait until it's done.
[grunts]
Hey, wait a minute!
It's Nightmare Night and you're here and not holed up in your cottage!
Does this mean what I think it means?
I thought maybe you decided to come out with us tonight.
Technically speaking, you already are out right now.
So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends?
I know they'd be super excited.
You would make them so happy if you joined in.
They wouldn't believe their eyes!
Come on, Fluttershy, what do you say?
Oh, yeah!
I can't believe we're finally doin' this!
Don't you know?
Applejack, didn't you know about any of this?
[sighs]
Didn't we just shelve all the books in the library a few months ago?
Well, claw massages, back rubs, bubble baths...
You weren't really looking for an answer, were you?
[flatly]
Whoa.
That much?
Yes!
Best long weekend ever!
Whoa!
That strange yellow orb in the sky!
What is that?
A little while?
We've been in that library for three straight days!
Hey, you promise a claw massage, I'm getting a claw massage.
Did you rehearse before you found us?
Since sometime in the last three days, I guess.
I'm jokin', I'm jokin'!
Oh, I love her!
[laughs nervously]
Both.
[to himself]
Dearest?
Somepony sorry she missed it?
[gulps]
I knew it!
You are jealous!
[chewing]
[mouth full]
Come again?
I guess so.
[gulps]
Or maybe there isn't, and you should just drop this whole thing and admit that you're a little jealous!
Some things just can't be explained.
Spell?
Wait.
If that's the potion, then what's brewing in your cauldron?
Jealous?
Sorry, buddy.
Guess you had to be there.
[clapping]
Wow, hehe.
That was even better than the first eleven times.
[clears throat]
Come on, Twilight!
You can't be nervous about giving a speech to a bunch of magic students!
[sighs]
Perfect?
[snoring]
Huh?
Huh!
Starlight Glimmer?
Nothing good, I bet.
I heard she wasn't very happy the last time you saw her.
And now she's coming back for revenge.
Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech!
Yeah.
That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge.
Or it's totally true!
Where'd she go?
I guess we could start with this.
[continued screaming]
Cloudsdale?
Starlight doesn't even have wings!
Why would she come here?
Isn't that Rainbow Dash?
...We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash raced the bullies who made fun of Fluttershy and performed her first sonic rainboom?
With this.
Come on, let's go!
To watch the race.
I don't wanna miss the rainboom!
Whoa!
Um, Twilight?
I think it already is.
Uh, Twilight?
Where's your castle?
But why?
And how did we get here?
Where's here?
What do you mean?
So we're back where?
I mean, when we started?
Plus there's the whole missing castle thing.
You think?
I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this, Twilight.
Is that Sugarcube Corner?
[gasps]
[panting]
Rarity?
[grunts]
Rarity?
Probably to become a world-famous fashion designer, I bet.
Actually, it's when.
There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it.
So...
how are we gonna set things right?
And that the map's still here.
[screaming]
Twiliiiiiiight!
[screaming]
Thanks!
Right!
Um, Twilight?
I know, but?
Like over there?
Look!
Ugh.
Well, that didn't work.
Hey, Twilight?
I don't think you'll have to!
Starlight Glimmer?
We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash performed her first sonic rainboom?
I don't think you'll have to.
[belches]
This is cozy.
That's strange.
No, it's just the other times we've come back, it's been day!
But look!
Um, maybe we should figure it out later!
Well, don't just stand here!
This place looks a lot cleaner than I remember.
Rarity, it's me!
[whimpers]
Your kingdom?
Um...
Celestia, of course!
Twilight, no!
Come on, Starlight, look around!
Well, why not?
[kissing]
One Castle of Friendship ?
check!
One group of amazing friends ?
check!
[muffled]
Morning, Starlight!
[muffled]
Next door on the left!
It's not hard to understand.
Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't.
Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!
Eh...
plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings.
Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart.
They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes.
Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power!
And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up.
That hasn't happened in a millennia!
The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess.
I...
didn't help Twilight with that part.
Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?
Which one?
What's so terrible about that?
You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria.
Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh...
[clears throat]
exploits.
You should talk to Twilight about it.
I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say.
It's a Crystalling invitation!
Maybe there is!
You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list.
All we have to do is follow it!
Aye-aye, Princess!
I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered.
Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too.
It's all part of the lesson.
Trust the lesson.
Oh, yep, it sure is!
Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house is?
Nah, it's no big deal.
...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire.
Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship!
I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off.
Wait!
Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list!
I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right!
[clears throat]
[reading]
Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting.
I don't know...
I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south!
And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards!
Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all!
It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment.
[beat]
Highlight the importance of the meeting ?
check!
I can't believe you wanted to skip that!
Huh.
Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all.
Starlight, come on!
We have to at least explain what Twilight wants!
I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here.
There's gotta be somethin'...
Got it!
[reading]
And if all else fails, ask them to share an embarrassing moment from their past, maybe even something they regret!
[groans]
Aw, it's not your fault.
I'm the one who said all we needed was this list.
[blows fire]
I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.
Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with!
And I do too!
[exhales]
Uh, that's not dragon breath.
It's freezing!
It is...
unless something's happened!
Come on!
Technically, she's more of a student than a prot‚g‚.
See?
I told you he'd be impressed.
Well, if you ever want to tell her about it, we should probably leave now!
What's wrong, Twilight?
What are you talking about?
Your lesson went perfectly!
Starlight and Sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship!
Well, I know she needed to be put on the right path, but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well.
Isn't that how Celestia taught you?
Maybe you're a better teacher than you thought.
[licks lips]
Basket holder?
I thought I was your bodyguard.
Ugh, I can't!
[groans]
[grunts]
I don't know!
Nngh!
All of a sudden, my scales just started glowing and...
burning!
Great...
H-How do I make it stop?
[gulps]
How could I forget?
He would have burnt us to a crisp if you weren't there.
If I have to go to the Dragon Lands, would you two come with me?
Shh!
It's Spike.
It's nice to see you too, Garble.
Hey!
That's my rock!
Who is that?
No, next to him.
[gulps]
Uh, excuse me!
I don't want to be Dragon Lord or dragon toast, and I stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here!
Oh, uh, hi, your Lordship.
Uh, I was just going home!
[nervous chuckle]
Of course, your Lordship!
I, uh, guess I don't understand dragon customs.
Another reason why I shouldn't compete.
Thank you!
[to Ember]
And thank you.
None of them can win!
Equestria's in big trouble if any of them are in charge!
There's only one thing to do, and only I can do it!
I have to win the Gauntlet of Fire!
It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons.
You heard them!
They have horrible plans for ponies if they win!
So somehow, I have to do it!
I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe.
I decided to compete.
I am a dragon, after all.
[scream]
[gasps]
[sarcastically]
Thanks, Garble!
I was planning on swimming anyway!
He's gonna drown!
[gasps]
[panting]
Hey, are you okay?
[gasps]
Princess Ember!
They're my friends!
Well, this dragon does.
But I thought your dad said that?
[straining]
Uh-huh.
You're welcome.
My, uh, old neighbor!
Uh, Sandy...
Rockbeach!
I could ask you the same thing.
You could've told Garble about my friends.
Are you kidding?
Those boulders are huge!
Hey, what if we worked together?
You fly me up there, and I'll help look out for boulders, like a second set of eyes!
I do know she could've told Garble about you, but she didn't.
I think we can trust her.
Really?
Great!
It's a deal!
Pull up!
There's one on your tail!
Go left!
So what do we do now?
Okay!
[gasps]
Oof!
About us?
[scoffs]
That tunnel was cake!
[groans]
Rarity!
[sighs]
It was nothing.
Well, that's just what friends do.
Don't you have anyone who looks out for you?
Wait, what do you mean?
So we aren't really friends?
I can't believe Ember ditched me.
She's not, though.
I know it.
She saved me, even when she didn't have to.
I don't care what she says.
That makes us friends.
It's kinda hard to tell.
They all look the same.
Except for this one!
Look!
We made it!
I can't believe I'm the only dragon to make it this far!
[screaming]
Ember!
I thought it was every dragon for themselves!
Why did you save me?
[panting]
Whoa...
Leave her alone!
That's right!
Uh...
Now, go start your long journey home.
And give every dragon you see on the way a hug.
Don't tell them why.
I command you to do it!
Dragon Lord Ember sounds a lot better.
The Dragon Lord is whoever brings the scepter back to your father!
Besides, you'll make a great leader.
I was just doing this to protect the ponies.
But I know you'll protect them just as well as I would have.
Absolutely.
My home is in Equestria with my friends.
It's called a hug!
Mmmmm!
And a new friend!
Got it!
I know!
I'm almost as excited as Pinkie Pie!
Come on, Pinkie, the show's starting!
[sighs]
Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?
And why would you deny yourself presents and candy?
That's crazy talk!
Oh, I love that one!
[narrating]
We get it.
Star Swirl's awesome.
[muttering]
Says the pony who tried to make everypony the same by replacing their cutie marks with equal signs.
[sips cocoa]
Proceed.
[laughing]
Wait!
Can we take a quick break?
I need to refill my cocoa.
[blows]
Okay, I'm ready.
Uh...
yeah.
We were just heading to pick up some fresh pies.
Heh.
I don't know why we keep running out at the castle.
[nervous laugh]
What are you gonna get?
Hey, Applejack!
Another order of pies, please.
Aah!
Dah!
Whoa-oa-oa!
Whoa!
Dah!
Whoa!
Uh, yeah.
We totally got everything covered.
Uh, Twilight?
Ready.
[reading]
Step one: open the gate.
Okay.
[reading]
Step two: close the gate.
That's what it says.
[reading]
Step three: walk away.
[intonation of I don't know]
Mmm.
Wouldn't it be easier to just fly?
[yelps]
Mmmh...
Maybe not the best plan.
Yeah, that must've been super relaxing!
They don't look scared to me.
And I'm here to make sure you do it right.
Up here!
I was supervising!
And then Zephyr asked me about different cleaning techniques and which one was best, and if I could?
Hey!
I did all the work!
Yeah!
Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history!
[blows fire]
[blows fire]
[blows fire]
[blows fire]
[blows fire]
[groans]
[groans]
[deep voice]
Spike?
Who's Spike?
[groans]
[normal voice]
Guys, you're blowing my cover!
How'd you even know it was me?
Right.
Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I still got mobbed in the street.
And this is just a family visit.
I wouldn't want the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind of circus.
Not if I find the right disguise, it won't.
It's like a ghost town.
I guess I don't need the disguise after all.
Save you from what?
[groans]
Ya think?
It's okay, guys.
They're with me.
And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I right?
That's not good.
Really?
Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to.
Have you ever known me to run from danger?
Or will your guards be safe with me?
Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can...
change.
And they could be anywhere.
So we should cover as much ground as possible.
You, search that way!
And you, search that way!
And...
I'll...
just search...
here, I guess.
Not many places to hide.
Unless that rock is a changeling.
Okay, rock.
How do I know you're really a rock?
Hmm.
Not talkin', huh?
Well, you can't fool me!
Uhh!
[screams]
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Uhh!
Phew!
[kisses]
Okay.
Maybe it's time Spike the Brave and Glorious went back to, uh, protect those guards.
Gah!
[sighs]
Just my reflection.
Huh?
Ha-ha!
Hmm.
Just my imagination, I guess.
[screams]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changeling!
[stutters]
[screaming]
[screaming]
This is unexpected.
You...
saved me?
Wait!
I don't understand.
Changelings are supposed to be evil...
right?
But...
what?
That would be from the royal Crystalling.
It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby.
What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try?
It is!
I mean, I am!
It's me, Spike!
Spike the Brave and Glorious?
I'm sure you've heard of me.
Why?
Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you?
Of course!
And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too.
But...
maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first.
Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious?
Not having to fight the changeling at all!
Because I made friends with him.
I am serious.
He wants to be friends!
I'm not joking!
The changeling is nice!
You're right, Shining Armor.
Sorry.
That was a...
bad joke.
Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought.
I think I might know!
Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to introduce you to my friend, uh...
Uh, Crystal, uh...
Hoof!
Crystal Hoof!
[chuckles]
My good friend, Crystal Hoof.
To the Equestria Games!
That's when we met.
We've been pen pals ever since.
Well, I...
I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are...
studying.
Yeah.
[laughs nervously]
Great!
Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city.
I told ya.
Relax.
You're winning them over.
Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling.
[nervous laugh]
Wait, no!
You don't understand!
I...
...I don't know.
Yeah...
Me, too.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me.
Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible....
But I bet I know where!
Thorax!
Hello?
I just want to apologize!
I should have stood up for you...
Aw, come on, Thorax!
I know you're in here!
[yelps]
[panting]
Little help?
Because you're my friend.
I just wish I had been one to you.
[yelps]
You don't have to ask.
What I should've done in the first place.
I do!
He's not a thing!
His name is Thorax, and he's my friend!
You are?
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls.
[whispering]
Uh, I dunno what to say.
I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it...
Wait!
Um, we were wondering...
What are you up to tonight?
Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out?
Is that, like, something you do?
[to Big McIntosh]
I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
Eh, something like that.
[nervous]
You should totally come.
Three of us would be way better than two...
Too bad you're busy.
I do like basking in things.
See you tonight.
[hushed]
Twilight's castle.
The fun starts promptly at sundown.
And...
we have sundown.
Repeat, we have sundown.
I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!
It's guys' night.
Oh, yeah.
Havin' fun now.
Oh, yeah!
What the hay?
Actually, we're staying here.
I hope you like awesome games!
Uh...
I'm talkin' about a real game.
Not exactly.
Wait here.
[off-screen]
Okay!
In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness.
This is...
Ogres & Oubliettes!
The best game ever?
You're right!
Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game.
Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or...
[stifling laughter]
as we call him...
the Squizard!
[chuckling]
[clears throat]
The Squizard has laid siege to the last free city in Spiketopia.
That's the name of the land.
He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity.
[beat]
Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much.
First things first ?
you've gotta create a character!
Name?
[sighs]
The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not.
I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician.
Everyone treats me with the utmost respect.
And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception.
Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!
When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor.
And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard.
So, your character's name?
Captain Wuzz it is!
What class are you, Captain Wuzz?
There's Archers, Mages, Rogues...
You'll love it once we get started!
[rolls die]
How 'bout an Archer?
Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you?
[rolls dice]
We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard.
The bars are locked tight.
The bars exist in our imagination.
It is real.
In our imagination.
It's your turn first.
What do you wanna do?
Well, you can do whatever you want.
Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful.
That's a big risk.
You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed.
[rolls die]
Ooh, bad idea.
The guard gets mad.
You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
[rolls die]
The spell backfires.
So [stifling laughter]
your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
The guard laughs.
He calls his friends over, and they laugh too.
[rolls die]
[laughs]
As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!
I told you, you can't do magic!
Cut it out, Discord!
I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!
[sighs]
No, we want to go back to Ogres &?
Stop messing with us!
We wanna?
Discord!
Look, we don't wanna do these things.
We wanna play our game.
If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch.
Sir McBiggun?
And I'm...
Garbunkle?
That means...
Sweetness!
We're in the game!
Check it out!
Ka-zam!
It's guys' night!
Oh, yeah!
In the game now!
Oh, yeah!
Discord, where are you?
This is great!
You made the game real!
Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?
Run!
Discord!
This isn't funny!
Ugh!
[groans]
This kinda hurts!
Like, real pain!
Discord, this is awful!
Why are you doing this?
You're the worst!
Because we felt bad for you!
[panting]
We're okay, we're okay!
No thanks to you, Discord!
Who wouldn't?
Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay!
And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!
[sighs]
We only invited you to be nice!
I mean, you're kind of a...
weirdo!
Good!
[sighs]
It...
it's better this way, right?
Because...
now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself...
all alone...
with no friends.
[sighs]
[clears throat]
[unenthusiastic]
We find ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard.
The bars are locked, and...
Ah, who am I kidding?
We should give him another chance.
[clears throat]
Captain Wuzz?
Can you hear me?
What?
Can't hear you.
Huh?
Yeah, yeah!
Okay!
What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute?
I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever!
So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering...
What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?
I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!
Bull's-eye!
Way to go, Starlight!
Twenty moons from now?
[to himself]
Sure, keep telling yourself that...
[sighs]
Hey!
Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot.
Just checking to see if you need anything before we left.
[disbelieving]
Uh-huh.
So...
what are you doing, exactly?
[blows]
[reading]
Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie, scrapbook with Applejack, sew with Rarity...
Help an animal with Fluttershy, chillax with Rainbow Dash?
What is chillaxing?
You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so.
Well, if you were, it'd be?
I think maybe you're missing?
And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out.
I had no idea we had spiders in the castle!
I'm never sleeping again!
You're really missing the point here.
Told ya.
Told ya.
[panting]
Twilight, can you slow down a bit?
[sighs]
Getting out of their element?
Huh.
I guess a boat trip qualifies as that.
Uh...
right.
Well, at least you don't have to worry about them talking over each other.
[snap]
Aren't Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack with you?
Rarity's not coming?
Awww.
So I polished my scales for nothing.
Right behind you!
[stuffing his mouth]
If it's too difficult to talk about, we completely understand.
Huh.
Then what happened?
So you were stuck out in the middle of the ocean?
How in Equestria did you get back?
That's a relief.
[chewing]
Okay, but if the boat sank, how did you all get rescued?
[fed up]
That's it.
We've gotta go talk to Applejack.
I just really, really wanna know how they made it back!
But yeah, that'd be great too.
I'll go.
That sure doesn't sound like Rarity or Pinkie Pie!
If they all blame each other, I don't know how we're gonna get them to talk again.
I just don't get it!
All of their stories are so different!
[sigh]
We're never gonna figure out what really happened.
I guess...
They were all on a ship that sank, and...
that's about it.
I hope this plan of yours works.
[frustrated scream]
Will somepony please tell me how you made it back?
Ugh.
Like I said, I sure hope this works.
[nervous laugh]
[hushed]
Whatever you're looking for, I hope you find it soon!
You said it!
[grunting, yelps]
Well, we don't all have magical horns.
What's that?
It's...
it's...
incoming!
It is the fastest way to get mail!
Are they upset with you?
What do you want?
Twilight's very busy!
Make an appointment!
She's a princess, after all!
Yeah, right.
Whatever.
[yelps]
[groans]
Just, uh, wanted to make sure you're ready for your big ceremony today.
Are you kidding?
You totally deserve it!
After all, you...
saved Equestria from...
Queen Chrysalis!
With the help of Trixie and Thorax and Discord and...
Uh, right.
Uh, so...
what are you wearin'?
I-I mean, you could.
It's like Rarity always says...
[imitating Rarity]
There's no such thing as overdressed, darling.
You're just the best-looking pony in the room.
[chuckles]
No, don't look!
'Cause there was a spider there, but it's, uh, gone now, so, uh...
thanks, Starlight!
Byeeee!
Ha-ha!
She had no idea.
We're a good team, Sparkle!
I thought you were getting her a mirror like yours.
Uh, maybe you should get her a card 'cause I don't think the mirror will say all that.
But I think she'll like it.
Yeah, about that.
Don't you need to get the castle ready for the celebration?
Twilight, are you reading during a party...
again?
Wild guess ?
something's wrong.
Whoa!
[chuckles]
Huh?
Where're you gonna send her?
Uh, too soon?
Cool spell.
Uh, this doesn't seem like something Starlight and Thorax would do.
Yep.
Definitely a Twilight fantasy.
Uh, that probably won't happen.
Okay, that doesn't sound anything like Ember or Starlight.
[gasps]
Freaky.
Twilight, this is crazy!
Starlight's really good with magic.
She could just stop herself from falling into a pit of lava.
Three, two, one...
Twilight, snap out of it!
Easy, Twilight.
It didn't happen.
[voiceover]
Are you talking about Twilight?
I can't see what you're thinking about.
[voiceover]
You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?
[chuckles]
Oh, it definitely is.
Like, a lot.
[chuckles]
Yeah, I have three new comics to get through.
[nervous laugh]
Yeah, I'm gonna go...
all the way over here.
Hey, are you okay?
Wait, what?
Hah.
I remember that.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Okay...
You do what you need to do.
I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.
A little to the left.
Oh, now rotate it just a hair...
Food and presents always cheer me up.
Okay, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse, [sighing]
and pick up treats.
Yeah, knock on wood.
Actually, we kind of are?
[suddenly muffled]
Uh-huh.
I take it Flurry named it?
Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar.
You mean day?
Mmm...
Mm-mm.
Uh-uh-uh!
Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go.
Do we, though?
Ugh!
[sighs]
You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do!
Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?
All right, that was pretty adorable.
But now...
When they said mashed peas were her favorite...
...did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?
Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule.
[panting]
[out of breath]
Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!
I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect.
Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were already behind...
we're still...
fifty five minutes behind!
I mean...
[nervous chuckle]
Yay, team?
How about Burnferno, Warrior from Within?
It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!
Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are.
Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?
How do you figure that?
Huh.
I shouldn't have doubted you.
[nervous squeak]
Hey, you guys!
No need to fight!
Uh...
Hang on!
I'm sure there's another one!
Ugh, no, not this one...
Oh, that's cute...
Aha!
Told you I'd find another one.
[gasps]
[chuckles nervously]
Uh...
Twilight?
Uh, sorry.
I was just gonna say, we're here.
And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!
[gasps]
What?
What was it?
Twilight, look up!
So are you!
Twilight, look out!
Oh, yeah, where's her Snoozle?
You know, her Whacky Whompy thing?
The snail?
Where is it?
Cadance said it calms her down.
[reading]
The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset.
'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon!
Thank you!
Okay, now who wants more cake?
Uh, yeah, right.
Just happened to be walking past.
[chuckles nervously]
[dreamily]
So selfless...
So generous...
Countess Coloratura?
Spike?
What?
I'm sure that's not why she looks...
like that.
Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something.
Is the banner even?
Are the flowers in place?
By which I mean completely out of view.
I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers.
And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship?
Is it still flaming?
I have lots of reasons.
In fact, I wrote them down.
Reason number one ?
I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today.
Reason two ?
the Dragon Lord is a dragon.
Reason three ?
she's coming here to learn more about friendship.
Which brings me to to reason number four.
The Dragon Lord wants my advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down.
I...
I just want things to be perfect.
[gasps]
Thorax!
You're in Ponyville!
Apparently.
I have no idea.
[whimpers]
I completely forgot!
Thorax wrote and said he needed to talk, and I told him to come over.
I didn't realize it was the same day I invited Ember!
What am I gonna do?
[teeth chattering]
Probably not.
Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating.
And Thorax is...
Or worse ?
they'll hate each other!
And if the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight...
[gulps]
I could be responsible for starting a war that could ruin Equestria as we know it!
[gasps]
[hyperventilates]
So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?
Sounds like you really need to unwind.
Uh, how about a, uh...
a trip to the castle?
Heh.
You can't miss that view.
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
grab some ice cream for us and catch up.
Heh-heh.
Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands and for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to...
uh, Ponyville.
[quietly, to himself]
I gotta work on my official speech.
[chuckles]
She's in her castle.
D'oh!
Uh, well, yeah, but...
[nervous stammering]
Dah.
I think I feel one coming on.
Or we could stay here.
Ohhh.
Good.
They're not here.
Uh, I...
I said, It's all clean in here!
Uh, you must be hungry from your travels.
Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet.
[aside]
Dragons love gems!
Just keep her here.
[to Ember]
Okay, yeah!
[laughs]
Enjoy all the, uh...
crystal...
things!
Just gotta use the little dragons' room!
What?
Oh, right!
Uh, they ran out.
Heh.
Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly.
Be right back!
Ember's here!
I don't know!
Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me.
We need to switch places!
They might be getting suspicious.
Dah!
What's happening?
[whimpers]
The map is calling me?
I know!
Okay, okay.
To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help.
You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream.
Yeeeees!
Go easy on me.
I'm under a lot of pressure.
Friendship problem?
Anypony gotta friendship problem here?
Any problems to solve?
Friendship problems?
Friendship problems!
Anypony got a friendship problem here?
Okay.
Yes!
Fighting!
Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?
...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.
Oh, come on!
Glow!
Yep.
[laughs]
I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.
Uh, sssssure.
Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible.
Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second.
Ponies, please!
If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem.
You two should sit together.
You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies.
I think if you made a little effort, you'd find?
Whoa!
Okay, that had to have done it.
Come on, spikes.
Glow!
[strains, sighs]
[gasps]
Uh, actually, I, uh...
need a minute...
alone...
to, uh, really come up with great advice!
[pants]
I'll be right back.
Uh...
Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else.
Uh, well, I've seen you.
[chatters]
[screams]
My worst fears are happening!
Noooo!
[panicked]
Equestria as we know it is over!
The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin!
And it's all my fault!
My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie?
Hey.
You guys aren't fighting?
Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?
So I...
was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.
No, no, of course not!
But?
Wait.
Isn't that why you're here?
Wait, please!
[sighs]
[to Thorax]
I'm sorry.
No, that's not it!
Thorax, wait!
Oh, no...
What have I done?
I think they're gone.
They probably never want to see me again.
[gulps]
I know.
I'm so sorry.
You have every right to be.
Whoa.
You guys should be mad at me.
I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right.
[sighs]
Can you forgive me?
[laughing]
No way!
It's finally happening!
I solved the friendship problem!
Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson.
I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along.
Yup.
[through loudspeaker]
So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack!
May the flame of friendship burn for eternity.
My cauliflower bites blew her sweet potato muffins out of the water!
So, what'd she pick?
The cauliflower bites, right?
[groans]
What's all the commotion in here, ladies?
I, uh, ate them all.
They were actually really good.
[chuckles]
[belches, sighs]
Aw, thank goodness.
I thought I had too many deep-fried gems.
Come on, Twilight.
Even Princess Celestia takes a break sometimes, and she raises the sun.
[grunt]
You need a vacation!
I can keep track of the friendship log, boost community morale, and answer fan mail for a few days.
[loudly]
What?
I can't hear you!
You're on vacation!
I know.
Wait for it...
There it is.
Seriously.
All of them.
[yawns]
Figure it out yet, Twilight?
[yawns]
Well, that sure sounds like a clue to me.
[blows]
Cheer up, Twilight.
Finding a whole set of ancient ruins is pretty impressive.
Maybe you could write a paper on it.
Uh...
Twilight?
What can we do to help?
Good thing you brought the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons to help you navigate our customs.
Like our favorite sport ?
gorge surfing!
Whoa, fellas.
As the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I have to say that's not very friendly.
[nervous chuckling]
[gulps]
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoooooaaaaa!
Aaah!
[grunting]
[painting]
I won?
I won!
Woo-hoo!
Give up the shield, Garble!
Uh, s-since Dragon Lord Ember commanded you to make peace with ponies, you can't very well attack one of their friends, can you?
I wasn't hiding when I beat you down the ridge.
Finders keepers, remember?
That's good news.
What about this one?
If there is, Twilight will find it.
[panting]
I can stop carrying books?
Maybe we should try there?
Maybe so, but the Pony of Shadows doesn't really seem like the friendship type.
Well, nopony does.
Even your school?
But you're you!
[scoffs]
After everything we've been through, how hard can that be?
I'm gonna go with really hard.
Great to see you, Ember!
Uh, which one is Smolder?
Who are you, and what have you done with Twilight Sparkle?
Twilight?
You feeling okay?
[sighs]
Look on the bright side.
Sure, the EEA closed your friendship school.
But now you've got time to do other stuff!
It's like being on vacation!
Whoa!
Okay, then.
I'm gonna need backup.
Operation Cheer-Up is a go!
[clears throat]
Just two small problems.
The school is still unaccredited...
...and we don't have any students.
Smolder, Ocellus, Silverstream, Yona, and Gallus disappeared together.
That's all we know.
Aw, yeah!
[panting]
You're lucky we got here in time!
Look!
She said it without doing the eye thing!
Okay!
Okay!
Slow down, everyone!
I'm doing my best!
So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show, and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?
I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!
Yeah!
They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.
Good thing Pinkie Pie reminded us, or we would have forgot to celebrate.
Did she just...
prance?
We would?
Yeah...
When did that happen, exactly?
[whispering]
I guess, but how are we supposed to give her directions?
She's the ruler of Equestria!
Hmmm...
Yeah, what she said.
Yeah, that's how I felt, too.
[amplified]
Places, everypony!
We're here to rehearse A New Day in Equestria!
[amplified]
Directed, written, and produced by Twilight Sparkle.
And...
here comes the best part.
Um, what?
Again!
Step, buck, leap, touch!
Again!
Step, buck, leap, touch!
Got it?
Movin' on!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Why don't we just cancel the show?
No, think about it.
Right now, most of Equestria doesn't even know we're doing a ones-versary play.
If we shut it down...
Yeah.
Heh.
That's what it is.
Ahem.
[sighs]
The simplest acting exercise they could think of ?
a game of charades.
[to On Stage]
Now, that's the best acting we've seen all day.
Good luck.
Nopony's gonna volunteer to try to tame that.
[gulps]
So...
[chuckles nervously]
Ahem.
Uh, who likes juggling?
Ugh!
Good news ?
free food.
[chewing]
Bad news ?
this play is officially a disaster.
Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship.
Raising the sun every morning was so hard that it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.
Y-Yes.
And, uh...
raising the sun each day was super draining.
But you can see that for yourselves, right?
I mean, do these guys look beat-up or what?
Star Swirl's so stressed, he's got kinks in his horn!
But that's okay.
'Cause it turns out Celestia had a special power to raise the sun all by herself!
Wait, what?
We don't?
If you need some pointers, let me know.
I've been on my fair share of missions.
And that's my fair share.
You know, I can go if you two don't want to.
I am kind of an expert.
You said it, Big Mac.
This is taking forever!
I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart, but this is an emergency, right?
Discord?
A little help?
Discord!
[sighs]
Yeah?
Good idea!
[clears throat]
Captain Wuzz!
Are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Uh, sort of.
But do you think you could magically hurry up this pie real quick first?
This needs to go in the mail today, or it'll never get to Sugar Belle in time for Hearts and Hooves Day!
Well, pies really are Sugar Belle's thing.
But I think that makes this all the more special.
It shows you're interested in what she cares about.
And he's planning a big romantic Hearts and Hooves dinner.
It was my idea to bake the invitation inside.
Pretty clever, huh?
Awww.
Sugar Belle.
See?
For a formerly friendless immortal despot, you're pretty cynical.
Aw, come on.
You act tough, but deep down, you're a softie.
I mean, you don't have tea with Fluttershy every weekend because you like tea.
Tell you what.
While Big Mac mails his incredibly romantic gesture, I'll show you the splendors of Hearts and Hooves Day in Ponyville.
I bet I can prove you believe in love.
Is it, like, a riding mower or...
[gulps]
[sighs]
Another Hearts and Hooves Day.
Love is in the air, Discord.
Look at all these happy couples.
As a great dragon poet once wrote to his beloved, I love you with the utmost clarity.
I love you, dear.
My sweet, sweet Rarity?
Are you even listening?
Sure, after you admit you believe in love and...
Sugar Belle!
Big Mac's girlfriend.
What's she doing in town so early?
[gasps]
She's planning her own romantic surprise for Big Mac?
What if she goes to Sweet Apple Acres before Big Mac's ready with his surprise?
We've gotta warn him!
Aah!
[slurring]
Mig Bac...
Mig Bac...
[groans]
I mean, Big Mac!
We just saw Sugar Belle!
She's at Sugarcube Corner!
But I think she's on her way over here now!
You gotta keep her away from here until the barn's finished!
I wonder what she has planned for him.
Aah!
Ugh!
Will you warn me next time you do that?
Ohhhh.
She hasn't seen him yet.
Take note, Discord.
This is what love is all about.
Make fun of me all you want.
But look at Big Mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love.
Hey.
We're just...
not spying?
Ugh.
Okay.
Things seem bad.
Maybe they're really not.
Maybe we're finished was about the day.
Ponies say that, right?
Like-like, Hey, remember yesterday?
That's finished, 'cause it's today!
Maybe not that.
Oh, I know!
Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs Cake, who does that, like, two days a week.
N-No, no, three.
That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because...
she'll already be here!
Nah.
I don't even buy that one.
I don't think leaning's gonna help.
Am I doing it right?
Whoa!
We're not like you, Discord.
We can't put on a front and pretend not to love.
It's impossible.
Wow.
You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac.
I'm impressed.
I take it back.
I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle.
And now he's crying.
Don't touch it!
I'm looking!
Cut it out!
Discord, quit it!
Okay.
I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart.
You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve?
I hide from it!
When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you.
Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you.
Ugh.
Dude, how long have you been not hiding?
Did ya...
Did she...
Are ya...
[sighs]
What if you're right, Discord?
What if love isn't real at all?
Big Mac!
Where are ya goin'?
Discord, you gotta use your magic and...
Guess you have better things to do.
Big Mac's gonna need a miracle.
[sighs]
And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day.
Despite a bumpy start...
and middle...
and ending...
lot of bumps today...
love was in the air.
But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real.
Seriously?
Discord, come on!
I can't believe you!
You old softie.
[laughs]
I knew you had a heart.
Ogres & Oubliettes?
I thought you'd never ask!
Oh, and...
just wondering.
No biggie, but...
is Skellinore gonna be there?
Well, nopony's perfect.
Anything for you, Rarity.
Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee.
Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated.
Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves.
Uh, nothing!
[sighs]
It's a stone scale.
It isn't magical or anything like the call of the Dragon Lord.
It's just...
red.
And itchy.
[groans]
And embarrassing.
There's Peewee's parents!
But I don't see Peewee.
Peewee!
Ouch!
[scratching]
[sighs]
I don't want anypony else to see this.
Besides, I'm sure it'll clear up after a good night's sleep.
[snoring]
[groans]
Just five more minutes...
[continues snoring]
Noon?
Whoa!
I slept like a rock!
Which reminds me ?
all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!
[screams]
Hiding from my hideous face!
That's easy for you to say.
Your face isn't covered in itchy red spots!
[scratching]
Well, I'm not in magic school.
[chuckles nervously]
What could possibly be stressful about that?
Works wonders.
I've heard.
But I'm not leaving the castle until my face is back to its adorable self.
[winces]
[groans]
[gags, breathes fire]
I don't know what happened!
I just had a sudden case of?
[gags]
[breathes fire]
...indigestion.
I'm so sorry!
I can help you with?
[sighs]
Hey there, not handsome.
Uh, thanks.
What?
Oh, I, uh...
I...
[muttering lowly]
Sorry, Rarity, but I...
I am super busy all day giving...
tours of the school!
Classrooms are that way.
[groans]
Dorms are that way.
[groans]
Twilight's office is up there.
This is a fountain.
Um, yeah.
[wincing, scratching]
Sorry.
What?
Why?
[scratching]
[low voice]
I don't know.
[low voice, straining]
I don't...
know!
[low voice]
I said...
[loudly, echoing]
I don't know!
[gasps]
[echoing]
This is the school library!
It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study!
What?
[loud voice]
Was I shouting?
[clears throat, normal volume]
I have no idea what you're talking?
Ulp!
[belches, breathes fire]
[gasps and groans]
[breathing fire]
[low voice, straining]
Leave me alone!
[low voice, straining]
Leave!
Alone!
[low voice]
I said, leave [normal voice]
me alone!
[belches, breathes fire, sighs]
Molts?
[groans and winces]
No-no-no-no-no.
The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster.
Why would I do that?
Uh-huh.
What?
Why?
Smell?
[sniffs]
Ugh!
Wait!
Does the molt effect happen to ponies too?
[gasps]
Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today.
If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live?
I'm too young to grow up!
So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?
Dragons are scared of rocks?
[low voice]
So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?
[loud voice]
Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?
I didn't know where else to go.
I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out.
You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?
[scratches, sighs]
Is there anything you can do to cure me?
[scratches]
But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!
[low voice]
It's all so embarrassing.
[low voice]
I said it's [loud voice]
embarrassing!
Oh, no.
[gags, belches, breathes fire, sighs]
[loud voice]
I can't let Rarity see me like this!
Please don't let her know I'm here!
[loud voice]
You have no idea!
I'm not hiding from ponies.
I'm hiding from that!
Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?
It's only after me!
I'll lead it away while you get help!
This way, birdy-bird!
Molting dragon over here!
[grunting and huffing]
Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan.
Zecora!
Bring her back!
[groans, scratches]
[panting]
Rarity!
You have to get out of here!
There's a giant roc trying to eat me!
It's got Zecora!
Rarity, there's no time!
We have to get help!
[groans]
Let my ponies go!
Whoa!
[breathes fire]
[screams, groaning]
[sighs, scratches, wailing groans]
If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be [chuckles]
really embarrassing!
[groans]
About to be eaten by a giant predator attracted to my molt smell?
[scratches]
Whoa!
And Zecora!
I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!
[gasps, sighs]
Finally!
I didn't think that itching would ever stop!
What's happening?
I...
I can't move!
What just...
happened?
Did I just sprout wings?
I just sprouted wings!
[gasps]
I've gotta help them!
W-Whoa!
Whooaaa!
[yelping]
Whoops.
I don't know!
But they're pretty aweso?
Whoa!
Hey, giant chicken!
If you like dragons so much, come and get me!
Greetings.
[breathes fire]
[sighs]
It's what's been going on with me.
The breakout, the fire burps.
The molt is when dragons get older and start to change.
I wish I could stop it, but I can't.
I-I should go.
In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home.
It's called the molt effect.
But I'm growing up.
What if something even worse happens?
Woo-hoo!
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
Look at me!
Let's go home!
They are new, and I don't want to overdo it.
I'm glad to help, Rarity.
But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?
[sighs]
Huh?
Sorry, Twilight.
Still getting used to my new wings.
They're pretty great, huh?
Yes!
[laughs nervously]
[groans]
And the gems are real!
Eh, not that I...
tasted them.
The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.
Six months?
You're not really gonna be gone that long, are you?
No-ho-ho, thanks.
Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough.
[yells]
Goodbye, Rarity!
A-And everypony!
Then you also must've heard Starlight is in charge now.
Uh-oh.
When we play Ogres & Oubliettes and he puts that many E's in really, the things don't usually end well.
Okay.
I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week.
All you have to worry about is teaching class.
Twittermites?
[gasps for air]
[screams]
[sniffs, gags]
Actually, that does sound kinda helpful.
And it was next on our to-do list.
That is definitely not how Twilight teaches friendship.
Uh, guys?
That's not just any tree.
[blows nose]
It's a dragon-sneeze tree.
Come on, Discord.
You know that's not what she means.
I wouldn't count on it.
I think Discord's trying to test you.
Well, it's kinda what he does.
Even to ponies or dragons he cares about.
Hey-hey-hey!
Take it easy, Starlight!
Discord's your friend, remember?
[huffs]
She's right, Discord.
What's your problem?
That probably made things worse.
Why didn't you just talk to Discord?
No, you haven't.
Discord is just bein'...
Discord.
We can figure that out after the Spell-venger Hunt.
C'mon!
Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left.
I'll pass out the shields.
C'mon!
We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!
I thought you banished him from the school.
How?
No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord.
Detention.
Huh?
You're new to the world of education, aren't you?
Hey!
Watch the wings!
[to Discord]
Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.
Sure we do!
I love Hearth's Warming Eve!
It's all about friends and presents and family and...
presents!
It's that new bowtie I wanted, isn't it?
I'm waiting!
But in the meantime, I'm shaking!
[gasps]
[gasps]
[grunting]
Wha...
What happened?
Over there!
That's the students' quarters!
After that.
Did you hear anything?
And whoever did it ran into your rooms.
No one came out, and all of you are still here.
What?
Especially when you take the library with you.
Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?
I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
There's gotta be something we can do.
Let me try something.
[slowly, loudly, and deliberately]
Gummy!
Where is Pinkie Pie?
[grunting]
Inferno?
Where?
[shudders]
I did not need to hear that.
[muttering sleepily]
[groans]
Hey, guys.
Need me to help you decide something?
Whoa.
I thought you were arguing over ice cream flavors.
Uh, you're not really going to turn him to stone, are you?
Hey, class.
Welcome to the Theory and Defense of Friendship.
Yeeeeah.
Nice try.
Twilight sent me to tell you she won't be in today 'cause she has to cast a stone sleep spell on Rockhoof.
[I don't know sound]
Your instructions are to write an essay on heroism and what it means to you.
Oh, don't worry.
It doesn't have to be a long essay.
Can you do that?
Whoa!
Ta-da!
Got it!
[grunts]
[inhales]
[sighs]
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
[grunts]
I don't know about big, but I am definitely finished.
No, thanks.
If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you.
I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping.
What's the difference?
Ye-he-he-hes!
Wow!
Thank you so much!
How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
Uh-huh...
Did you say something, Twilight?
Sorry.
I'm just finishing up this thank-you throw pillow for Smolder.
And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone.
It's a pillow!
But not for your head.
Although it could be.
It's a throw pillow.
They're more casual.
You can use 'em anywhere.
You don't like it.
What?
I don't know.
But it's...
heading right for us!
Okay.
Now I really owe you for the lesson.
You all right?
Maybe not.
But you're hurt and need help.
So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
And sometimes, even dragons need help.
Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me.
So these ponies are more than my friends.
They're my family.
Missing something deep down and dragonish.
Did you ask in the Crystal Empire?
I'm kind of well-known there.
I can't believe it.
I have so many questions.
I guess my biggest question is simple.
Why was I an orphaned egg?
Whoa...
How did you know I was a boy?
Well, that's all in the past.
The only thing that matters now is that we're together.
And I'm gonna make up for lost time.
I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?
Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.
I mean, w-we don't have to.
[gasps]
Oh, yeah!
I can't believe we got so many things done.
But this is all my stuff.
Is there anything you always wanted to do with me?
Like a real dragon?
Huh?
Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish.
But I kind of feel less.
You think that's something we can do?
It's pretty sweet, right?
Uh, I can't?
Hey, I just finished organizing those!
What do I do?
You're right!
I feel better already!
You got it!
I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got...
Dad.
I didn't leave.
I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
Yeah!
And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it.
See you later!
Hey, gang!
Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room.
[sighs]
Isn't he the best?
Be right there...
Dad.
Oh, I am.
I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first.
What do you mean?
[scoffs]
That is dragon culture.
That's because you raised me.
Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
Maybe you just don't like that I have a real parent now.
Dragon?
Of all ponies, I can't believe you would have a problem with that.
Just sleeping outside like we're meant to.
It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
[sighs]
I'm so confused.
It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.
She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is.
Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does.
Well, not now, of course.
I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.
Huh.
Now I'm really confused.
Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.
That does sound perfect!
But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter.
But I do.
Dad, you've already shared so much.
What?
So...
you...
pretended to be my dad?
[sighs]
I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
That's the thing.
I know exactly who I am.
And how I got that way.
Um, Twilight?
He's gone.
Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all.
He also wasn't my real dad.
I'm the one who's sorry.
You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper.
Sludge was just a great big phony.
I don't think so.
I already know who my real family is.
Mm-hmm!
Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows.
[gagging]
[gagging, belches, sighs]
Thanks.
I've never had a letter get stuck before.
It's from Princess Celestia!
We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot!
Look!
Okay.
Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.
Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake.
Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
How about this?
In your bag.
Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.
I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad.
We gotta fix this!
We're just as trapped as Tirek?
Um, there's seven of us.
Seven!
So, what do we do, Twilight?
What about Tirek?
He's probably got some magic, too, right?
[belching]
[belching]
[belches]
Told ya.
[yelps]
Who, us?
Princesses can retire?
knew you were going to react this way?
We did.
Starlight when she was evil.
And it worked!
I mean, if you think about it, there hasn't been a single villain that we couldn't defeat.
[hushed]
Help!
She's spiraling!
We're at the my plan needs a plan stage of a total Twilight meltdown!
It was a valiant effort.
What if he has it already?
How are we gonna stop him?
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Does this mean...
How are we gonna stop him?
[clicks tongue]
Lookin' good.
What's wrong?
Is the Crystal Empire under attack again?
I'm pretty sure you're the only one that does that.
We got plenty of time to order more.
The friendship students won't be back until?
Uh, now?
Mmmmaybe next time, ease in with those truth bombs.
We've got that part under control, and Sombra won't be coming back, so...
some good news, right?
[aside, to Twilight]
She does have a point.
It looks like part of the Tree of Harmony.
But how?
I thought it was destroyed!
[sighs]
That's actually really reassuring.
So, who's gonna give us the tour?
Twilight!
Look at this scroll I just got!
Uh-huh!
[laughs]
This is no toy crown.
It's the hard-won helm of the Sibling Supreme!
I always wanted to be Sibling Supreme one day.
[reading]
Meet me at Celestia's castle to decide who deserves the crown once and for all.
Geese?
Shining Armor may have come up with some great security, but he'll never guess Twilight's plan.
[belches]
It's from Shining Armor.
[reading]
Dear Twily, hope your idea isn't just...
[indistinct muttering]
Tunnels?
He guessed your whole plan!
You've been practicing that speech, haven't you?
I always wanted to be a super-spy.
Is that the opposite of anything?
Special Agent Fluttershy, target detected below.
Shining Armor definitely won't expect that.
[gasps, sighs]
Gee, Fluttershy, I thought your whole small spaces thing was just part of the plan to be unexpected.
[sighs]
I know that that's like.
I was always excited to be a part of Twilight's and Shining Armor's rivalry, like I was their little brother.
But they never really thought of me that way.
Right.
Zephyr Breeze.
We, uh, kind of fell through the floor.
Psssssst!
Maybe we should go back to doing things the Twilight way.
It may not be a surprise, but you have a pretty good record for planning things.
What are little brothers for?
We mapped this out when we got lost down here.
The lever to the secret hallway entrance should be...
here.
I guess sometimes the best plan is the one you expect!
That's the thing about looks.
They can be deceiving.
Come on.
You two don't think you have the only sibling rivalry.
I had an inside pony help.
It wasn't hard to miss there were some disagreements on the whole security thing.
[voiceover]
So, while Shining Armor went on and on about his improved security measures, Luna and I struck a deal.
She put Zephyr in charge of the catacombs and helped keep Celestia out of the castle hallways.
Once Luna was on board, I just had to do my part and make sure we stuck to Twilight's plan so we'd all get to the throne room at the same time.
I knew Shining Armor would let it play out until the last possible second.
Then, while everyone was distracted by his gloating, all Luna had to do was float the crown over to me.
[sighs]
Huh?
Whoa!
Twilight, mail's here!
Is it a deluxe set of special edition Ogres & Oubliettes figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever?
Awww...
[belches]
So is this.
Really?
She couldn't have put it into the box?
[quietly, sarcastic]
Who could forget a masterpiece like that?
Is my Smash Fortune comic in there?
I've been looking for that for years.
Whoa, whoa!
[muffled]
Or this.
What's wrong?
It just looks like an old library book.
[clears throat]
Had a perfect record.
Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
I take it we're going to Canterlot?
[groans]
The sooner, the better, I guess.
Uh, why are we hiding?
Don't you wanna return your book?
[incredulously]
Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library?
Stop the presses!
Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home?
You sniff books?
One that makes mistakes like everypony else.
Trust me.
Once you return that book, you'll feel way better.
[groans]
[hushed]
Just ask where to return an overdue book!
It's no big deal!
It happens all the time!
She?
I mean, we have an overdue book.
See?
And that office would be...
Whoa.
[strains]
Looks like nopony ever goes down here.
And faithful dragon companions.
Uh...
hey!
It looks like First Folio left a note on the door!
[reading]
Out to lunch on Restaurant Row.
Guess we'll have to try back later!
Good, 'cause I'm starving!
[licks lips]
You mean to find First Folio.
Can we at least get takeout?
Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already!
[mock-sobbing]
Oh, uh, I'm not actually?
Well, I would probably order some naan as well.
For the table?
That's why you only order spicy if you can take it.
Twilight, what's wrong?
Twilight, the library is that way!
But what about your late fees?
Wait.
So you're not going to return the book?
I hope so.
It's the last Silver spot on the map we haven't looked.
[straining]
[gasps]
Whoa!
This place is?
You realize that might just be a you thing, right?
She's bound to be back soon.
Maybe we should just wait here.
Wow.
Dusty sounds like one busy pony.
Wait.
She looks pretty happy up there.
[snapping fingers]
[slurping]
And yours will, too?
[dryly]
Really?
Uhhh...
you don't wanna know.
Why don't you ask her?
You surprised her, and she probably had something else on her schedule.
That thing is packed!
Come on.
What have you got to lose?
Hey, everypony!
We come in?
Eh, pieces.
We're not actually here for the game.
That is not the reaction we expected.
From books?
That's it?
[clears throat]
In that case, can we keep it?
It might be a good reminder to have around.
[amplified]
Hello, everycreature!
I'm your DJ, Scales-n-Tail, spinning your favorite tunes all night long!
So welcome to the Fetlock Fet?
I mean, the Amity Ball!
Uh, Scales-n-Tail?
[amplified]
Oh, yeah, party ponies!
It's time to raise the roof and stomp your hoof for the traditional first dance of the night, the Pony Cotillion!
[amplified]
Time to shake things up a little!
That's right, everycreature!
It's the Pony Prance!
Yona!
I'm glad you're back!
Everypony wants to learn that crazy dance you did!
[amplified]
You asked for it, and DJ Scales-n-Tail is gonna deliver!
Everycreature join Yona for...
the Yakyakistan Stomp!
Did you say sweet guy and dragon in the same sentence?
Awww...
Hey!
What if she got a school credit for it?
Kind of like a...
a kindness field trip?
I'll go with her.
Okay, I made a list of what cheers me up when I'm down, so if your brother's like me, he's gonna love it!
What should we do first?
The Smile Song?
The sharing circle?
Or friendship bracelet weaving?
I got it!
Show tunes!
I can't wait to meet your brother, Smolder.
We're gonna be best buddies.
I just know it.
No problem.
I'll stay here and finish this comfort blanket.
It'll be like a hug every time Smolder's brother wraps it around himself.
Now, that's a thing of beauty.
Whoa!
That's Equestria's official friendship ambassador to the Dragon Lands to you!
And I'm not little!
I had the molt.
See?
Nothing!
Aah!
[grunts]
It's not a baby blanket.
It's a...
comfort blanket.
I made it.
And by the way, knitting's a lot harder than it looks.
[panting]
[panting]
Give it back!
That's for my friend!
Cut it out!
You know laugh fire's dangerous!
It can?
...do that.
[whispering]
We'd better get out of here before your brother shows up.
Garble isn't very nice to sensitive dragons.
Your brother?
Oh, brother.
[teeth chattering]
[whimpering]
So, uh, let's get lava diving.
What do you say?
Oh, it's okay to have a nickname.
Sometimes I'm called Spikey-Wikey.
Wait.
I thought you said your brother was sweet.
Yeah, not seein' it.
'Course not!
[nervous laugh, sighs]
You know, whenever I'm feeling a little down, it always helps if I do something with a friend.
How about we jump together?
Aah!
[gasps]
[stuffed]
Uh, I know there must be something worse than lava up your nose.
Ah...
ah...
[sneezes]
I just don't know what it is.
Aah!
[coughing]
[strained]
Swallowing lava.
Swallowing lava's definitely worse.
Try this.
Red velvet.
Guaranteed to brighten anycreature's spirits.
I dunno about you, but a change of scenery always turns my frown upside-down.
Aah!
[under breath]
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.
Sometimes, just hearing what someone appreciates about you can make you feel better about yourself.
Thank you, Smolder.
My turn.
I like how you always let everycreature know how you're feeling, Gar-Gar.
[pained groan]
Thank you for speaking your truth.
[groans]
Okay.
New activity.
Who wants to make vision boards?
I'll...
catch up with you.
[sighs]
Hey, Fluttershy.
How are the baby dragons doing?
Not a chance.
Smolder's brother is Garble.
The only thing that cheers him up is to make me miserable.
Huh?
See?
It's no use.
[sighs]
Why don't I see what I can do about the eggs and you cheer up Garble?
At least he listens to you.
Uh, what are you doing?
Hi, Ember!
I wish.
It's a long story.
Wow.
These eggs really do look scared.
Wait.
Aren't the hatching grounds supposed to be hot?
Then something's wrong.
I don't think the eggs are shaking because they're afraid.
They're cold.
I might have an idea.
See?
I wondered where that lava was coming from.
They must be draining it from the underground lake.
I don't think it works that way.
The hatching grounds can't be the only warm place in the Dragon Lands.
There's got to be somewhere else we can take the eggs.
I've been looking all over for you guys!
We need your help!
Hurry!
We can't give up!
There's got to be something we can do!
Hey, watch it!
That laugh fire could burn somepony!
[snaps fingers]
What?
Huh?
Their laugh fire's so hot, it's hatching the eggs!
Take a number, guys.
Aah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Or maybe this week's just a one-time thing that'll never happen again.
I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's the only pony that does that.
Apparently it's a celebration of all the swans in the royal lake.
We round them up, parade them through the streets, and finish with a party in the castle.
You're definitely not reading the same scroll I am.
[yelping]
Uh, what's the funny part exactly?
Okay, okay!
I think I got it!
Sunburst says we just need to reset the amulet with this!
Turn the screw on the back?
...and no more than one half turn.
So where is she?
Cheese Sandwich opened a factory?
Uh, Pinkie?
Are you sure this is edible?
Okay, Spike.
You know you might get distracted by the stacks of books and copious charts, so remember what to say.
Twilight, I know you're in full prep mode for Trivia Trot tomorrow, but you need to get some sleep!
Huh.
[laughs]
Nice work.
You got this.
[gasps]
This is weird.
Twilight!
What are you doing?
Cool.
I thought I'd have to force you to go to bed since tomorrow is your chance to be the first pony to win Ponyville Trivia three times in a row.
That is tomorrow, right?
Another what?
Uh, this is a whole new level of Twilight-ing, isn't it?
Heh.
Are you okay?
Well, good night, Twilight.
Good luck with your brain sleep and getting that third win.
[chuckles]
That wasn't a question.
Rules?
Isn't trivia just asking questions and answering them?
Oh, look!
We're here!
You don't get to pick your own team?
[sarcastically]
Twenty point one six B.
How could I forget?
I knew there'd be a chart!
Glad I'm just watching.
I don't think I could handle being your teammate.
What if I let you down?
What's wrong, Twilight?
Do I have to do that thing where I list all your successes as Princess of Friendship to put things into perspective and remind you this is just a game?
What'd I miss?
What's wrong?
So, I'm guessing the one pony who could mess up your winning streak is Pinkie?
So...
still think you can win?
I'll do it!
Just doing my job, Twilight.
One minute left in the refreshment/bathroom break?
Aah!
Maybe instead of focusing on Pinkie, you should just focus on how you're playing.
No complaints here.
Whoa!
These last-minute changes aren't too challenging, are they?
Yeah!
She finally realizes things will turn out fine, even when she isn't micromanaging every little detail.
[laughs nervously]
What are you doing here?
We'd need a miracle.
What did happen?
Higher than perfection?
Not the point, Rarity!
When you say it like that, it sounds like a really bad plan.
[shudders]
I hope the gem tart stall is still there again.
I could use a snack!
Nope.
Mm-hmm...
What?
Hey, Rarity.
[blows fire]
Oh, uh...
of course I was.
But just to be sure, could you say it all again?
Oh, no!
Is that the time?
[panting]
Uh-huh.
Oh, right.
Sorry, Rarity.
Can I take a rain check on...
What was that again?
Right.
Sounds great.
But I need to get to the post office before noon.
Rarity?
What are you doing?
Of course I forgive you.
But, uh, what are you apologizing for?
No, I'm not mad at you about anything.
Uh, because I had other plans?
Gabby and I are sort of pen pals.
Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth.
[slurps]
And we're both in the message-sending business!
Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time.
I'll fly with you.
[snoring]
Aah!
Rarity?
What are you doing here?
Whoa!
But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds.
You know what?
I'll just write her a note.
Absolutely.
Wow.
Rarity, you weren't kidding.
The Gem Crevasse was amazing!
I'll be snacking on these for a week.
Gabby!
You won't believe where I went today!
Mm-hmm!
Absolutely!
[grunts]
Thanks again, Rarity.
What a great day.
Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!
Sorry, Rarity!
You were?
Why?
Passes to Power Ponypalooza!
For today!
Uh...
of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out.
Okay!
Come on, Rarity!
Let's go!
Whew!
Are my claws sore.
[grunting]
Aww.
I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest.
[chuckles]
I think maybe you're right.
No way!
Ogres & Oubliettes?
Oh, she can try...
Success!
Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack!
And then?
Oh, hi, Gabby.
We were just?
No-no-no-no!
That's not true!
I can come with you on your rounds right now!
[sighs]
Prints, I guess.
You already have a lot of solid colors.
I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.
Yeah...
Uh-huh...
Rarity?
What are you doing?
You really miss spending time with me?
So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?
I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?
[whispering]
Wow.
You two need to be a lot quieter.
Yeah.
Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time.
Uh, were you just talking to someone?
[clears throat, reading]
Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, in light of her impending ascension to the throne of Equestria and in anticipation of her many duties and responsibilities forthwith, does hereby intend to make good on her previous offer to you, Starlight Glimmer, of replacing her as headmare of the School of Friendship!
[gags, belches]
Are you supposed to be at a royal etiquette lesson with Celestia and Luna right now?
Uh, Twilight?
Rarity says you were supposed to be at the boutique five minutes ago for your second fitting for the coronation gown.
A lot?
[sighs]
I just wanted everything to be perfect.
I mean, this was a big deal.
But when Discord insists on being involved...
It seemed simple when it started...
[gasps]
It's beautiful!
I'm not gonna eat it!
Because you have a big mouth.
Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal.
I'm the most romantic dragon I know.
Spill it!
Every detail!
Don't leave anything out!
[gasps]
You're making a picnic table that matches the shelf you made Sugar Belle for her shop when you had a crush on her, and you're setting up a romantic meal overlooking Sweet Apple Acres?
If you were a hopeless romantic, you'd know that was the only logical choice.
You painted apples to leave around Ponyville with little riddles tied to the stem that will lead her up here to meet you?
Yuh?
Come on.
He needs food for the picnic.
That was a gimme.
Okay.
You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat, and Discord will put all the apples in place.
Sugar Belle's gonna love it!
I'll get the food.
How long will it take you to place all the apples?
Are you sure you put them in the right spots?
She didn't see the apple!
What are we gonna do?
That's not romantic!
She needs to discover it!
[sighs]
Hey, Mrs Cake.
I need to pick up a few things.
Oh, it's kind of important.
Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?
All of them?
There's...
one, two, three, four?
Who needs twenty-one desserts?
Later won't work.
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.
[gags]
Ugh!
Did somepony else bake these?
No reason.
Maybe I can help you.
Delivering parchments is my thing.
A little dragon breath and fwoosh!
We deliver each scroll into each dessert.
Then you can help me.
Watch!
[inhales, blows fire]
Ta-da!
Discord.
You think?
Apples running everywhere, and she didn't see the poem to get to the hilltop?
To be honest, I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement.
Aah!
Uh, hey there, Big Mac.
Heh.
I bet you're wondering what?
I guess this can't get any worse.
Aah!
Uh, hey there, Big Mac.
Heh.
I bet you're wondering what?
I guess this can't get any worse.
So the messages that were in the desserts...
Hey!
Those desserts were ruined way before I ruined them!
In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo.
Uh, I think they did okay without us.
And when all the planning and grand gestures go wrong, it reminds you the most romantic things are usually the simplest.
Discord!
So, you freakin' out yet?
Oh, I don't know.
It's not every day the princesses that have ruled Equestria for hundreds of moons retire and pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
Royal advisor?
What's that?
Thanks, Twilight.
You know I'll always be your right-hoof dragon.
Joking?
Day of her coronation?
You've come a long way, Twilight.
They're not the only ones.
Wait.
Did you just walk here?
And how was that supposed to help again?
[sighs]
So what's the good news?
Dude, read the room.
[breathes fire]
[breathes fire]
We believe in you!
It's not every day the princesses pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
Too sticky.
There's no way anypony could get through this.
No, Discord!
This isn't the way to help!
Chrysalis was telling the truth.
They really have turned ponies against each other.
[gasps]
I know where Twilight is!
You'll come up with something.
We can't save Equestria without you.
Haven't we learned never to say that by now?
Because, even if you don't believe you can do this, we do.
We believe in you.
In us.
Although that part is pretty cool.
You think they know we're here?
Aah!
[breathes fire]
[groans]
Don't worry about me!
Just save?
[groans]
What happened?
Can I open my eyes?
The more creatures who know about friendship, the safer we'll be.
[slurps]
Chocolate rain?
How do you know that?
Twilight?
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's everything.
But we did a final check.
Of every room.
Twice.
Thanks, but I already read this one.
I don't need to take it to Canterlot.
Really, Twilight, we don't have to bring the comic.
I'm not even sure how much longer I'll collect them.
A lot is changing, and I am getting older.
You're not still worried about ruling Equestria, are you?
What is?
I thought we'd all be ruling Equestria together.
I guess I hadn't thought about it like that.
Maybe you should talk to them.
I bet they're feeling the same way.
Starlight is supposed to come over soon.
There's a little something we wanted to give you before we leave.
You know what?
I think you're right, Twilight.
I should take my comics to Canterlot.
We can't leave the Power Ponies behind.
Aren't you coming on the train?
It's true.
I was there.
That's nice, but you should be more worried about missing the train to Canterlot!
There's no time!
We wanted to give this to you before you left Ponyville, but things got a little hectic.
What's wrong, Twilight?
That would be awesome!
Aw, sure ya will, Twilight.
Now c'mon, you should get some shut-eye.
Big day tomorrow!
[sigh]
[snoring]
Huh?
What?
She replaced Twilight's with this one.
[yelping]
Uh, Twilight?
I...
think so.
But I have no idea what you are!
Twilight, you have to get it together!
Um, like you.
Only not you.
Your muzzle's really small.
Are you gonna scream again?
Where are we?
Works for me.
Yeah, I don't think that's how the new you is supposed to?
Well, look on the bright side.
You don't have those pesky wings to worry about anymore.
Makes sense.
You don't exactly have your horn.
We really need to find you a mirror.
I don't think this is a castle.
[eats]
Huh?
[barks]
Twilight, why didn't ya just tell her the crown was yours and ask for it back?
Hmm.
You make a good point.
And how exactly do you plan on doing that?
[growls]
Is that a threat?
[barks]
Research?
Way ahead of you.
It's a little [cough, cough]
dusty.
But it doesn't seem like anybody comes up here.
So, how did your research go?
There's a Rarity here!
Uh, I mean, uh...
interesting photo.
They do look like our friends.
But I thought we'd figured that out already.
Not so much.
I wouldn't put it past her.
But she wanted your crown 'cause she's planning on doing something even worse!
If you're gonna stop her, you have to focus on making friends here.
Can't worry about why these girls aren't friends anymore.
Even if they [yawning]
do remind you of your Ponyville friends.
[laughing]
You made a list?
That's so unlike you!
[laughs nervously]
Uh...
Please...
Continue.
Huh?
Hmm.
We tell them the truth.
Let them know what's really at stake if you don't get the crown tonight.
They'll help us figure somethin' out.
Twilight, these girls rallied around you 'cause they saw what was in your heart.
They aren't gonna feel any differently about you when they find out you're a pony princess in Equestria.
Me too.
Unless, of course, we get stuck here for another thirty moons.
Nope, she's pretty much spot-on.
Oh, yeah!
And back where I come from, I'm not even a dog!
I'm a ferocious, fire-breathing dragon!
Sure would love a scratch behind the old ears!
Uh, maybe later.
See?
Told ya.
Twilight!
Help!
[growling]
Twilight!
[whimpering]
Those are my girls!
Woo-hoo!
Seriously?
The talking dog is a weird thing about all this?
Oh, yeah.
We better get going.
That crown really does suit you, Princess Twilight.
And the wings?
Say what now?
But I still get to go, right?
There isn't another one of me at Canterlot High.
And you never know if you might need your trusty assistant.
Yes!
[cracks knuckles]
[blows]
[squeaks claws]
Ready!
She's got an official title now.
[imitates fanfare]
The Princess of Friendship!
She's even got her own castle!
You, uh...
really need to go ahead and do that whole magic of friendship thing now.
Totally!
Twilight can write a spell like it's nobody's business.
That's pretty much how she got to become a princess in Equestria.
Yeah, whatever.
Eh, that sounded...
way better than the last...
five times you've played it.
Heh heh.
[whimpers]
Of course she will.
Twilight Sparkle's never met a problem she couldn't solve.
Right, Twilight?
Knock 'em dead, Rainbooms!
Sorry I took so long.
I had to find somebody who wasn't under the sirens' spell to help me get you out.
Never takes off her headphones.
Ready!
[snoring]
[barks excitedly]
[pants]
Twilight, wake up!
I definitely wanna go on one of those.
Yeah!
Specifically squirrels.
More specifically, so I can chase 'em!
[barks, pants]
[barking]
Probably had another one of her nightmares.
I think you're just gonna have to pick it up.
[whimpers]
[struggling]
Fluttershy?
[snores]
[grunts]
[sighs]
Is it time to get up already?
[in his sleep]
So many squirrels...
Aw, man!
I was having the best dream.
Wait.
That dream could be a reality!
What happened?
Did she do that lifting things off the ground thing again?
I can track her down.
Was that an earthquake?
Hey, Twilight, why aren't you with everyone else?
What are we gonna do?
She thought you'd talk her out of it.
But why would he work so hard to make us think she was real?
We should tell Twilight.
Uh-huh!
I thought we weren't supposed to hike out that far.
Wait.
I thought Timber was just faking there was a magical nature creature.
Are you saying it's real?
[growls]
You did it!
Whoa.
Nice bling.
You got nothin', huh?
Well, if you ask me, Crystal Prep has got nothin' on CHS!
I love it here!
[shudders]
See what I mean?
[yawns]
How about you try jazz paws instead?
Mmm!
Rich with buttery undertones.
Find the buffet!
[sighs]
I'll say.
You think they got any more?
[whispering]
Now would probably be a good time to resume the search for that cupcake fountain.
Who would want to?
We, uh...
may have tried a few ourselves.
Heh.
[sniffing]
Follow me!
[sniffs]
[barks]
[yawns]
Ha-ha.
Let's get to it!
Twilight!
Hey, paw pals!
Welcome to this month's Fancy Fetch Unboxing with Spike!
I love pampering myself, and of course putting it on the internet for you, my fans, first!
#PuppySelfCare!
I've decided to splurge a little this month and get the deluxe package!
Let's get a better shot.
Whoa!
Look at this!
Fabulous Fido's Faberge Flying Disk.
Of course you can't actually throw it.
Far too delicate.
[kisses]
Hmm.
What other gems do we have here?
Slippers to make your paws feel plush!
They're encrusted with locally-sourced amethysts.
Oh...
my...
goodness!
[laughs]
This is why I started vlogging in the first place!
I've been waiting for a sniff like this.
It's a classic white ankle sock.
Cotton/nylon blend, two hundred wears deep, never washed.
This ain't no dry wick.
This baby is as absorbent as they get!
[sniffs, sighs]
Huh?
[laughs nervously]
Can't put a price on...
#PuppySelfCare?
And now, for my new show ?
Reboxing and Returning Stuff.
Uhhh...
Trixie, everyone believes that you're Great and Powerful.
You don't have to prove it!
I'm worrying!
I'm worrying!
Worldwide, y'all!
Equestria Girls crew!
Keepin' it hot on a yacht!
And it's aaaaaall good!
Sorry.
I wanted to see what it's like to be a dancer.
[narrating]
How come nobody's talking out loud?
Sorry.
I wanted to see what it's like to be a dancer.
[narrating]
How come nobody's talking out loud?
Don't worry, Rarity!
I got it!
Nuh-uh!
I got it!
I got it!
[yells]
[growls]
Please!
Call me when the flying can opener learns how to fetch.
You're the worst.
[chowing down]
[grunting]
[grunting]
[grunting]
...and that's the last time I ever went to a dragon wedding!
Phew!
[groans]
'Scuse me!
Dragon on the move!
Important princess documents comin' through!
Okay, Twilight.
Got all your charts and graphs.
Whachoo talkin' 'bout?
It'll be fine.
Just remember the most important thing.
Eh...
You're a Princess, too.
[humming fanfare]
Presenting Songbird Serenade!
[weakly]
Ta-da...
Uh, hi, Rarity.
Heh heh.
Whoa!
I think so, but what happened to her horn?
Well, you saw the size of those goons.
You seriously wanna go back?
Hungry?
We're all behind you, Twilight.
Uh, south?
We could be going in...
circles!
Endless...
sand...
[inhales]
Nothin' for miles...
but sand...
[breathes]
and this rock...
[coughs]
and this cactus...
[breathes]
and this roooooooooaaaaaad....
[breathes, faints, breathes]
...this rooooooad....
Whoa!
Who you callin' a gecko?
Huh!
[screams]
[yells]
Dah!
Shh!
So you're delivery guys?
Whoa!
[yelps]
Huh?
[breathes fire]
Something bad happened here.
Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town.
Guys?
Guys?
What is...
[puffs]
...happening?
Twilight?
It's okay.
You'll figure it out.
[muffled]
Twilight, look out!
[muffled]
Twilight, help me!
Twiliiiiiight!
She's!
Been!
Taken!
[panting]
Twilight's been taken!
Tempest!
She grabbed her!
And took her on her ship!
Whoa!
That's it, right?
We didn't make friends with anypony else?
[breathing fire]
[breathes fire]
[clears throat]
Fillies and gentlecolts, get ready for a little...
Songbird Serenade!
Not wrapping paper.
A to-do list.
And you could get the pony you pick something really nice.
[sighs]
Uh...
Um, Applejack, is it against the rules to trade names?
Like if I had a better idea for somepony special?
I mean specific?
Great!
So, uh, who do you?
What?
That's not who I?
Heeeey, Twilight!
Whatcha planning to get your secret pony?
Maybe something sparkly?
Fashionable?
Welp, gotta go!
Wish me luck!
Well, yeah!
If everypony's only getting one gift, we have a ton of responsibility to make sure it's extra-special good.
Pinkie!
Whoa!
Uh, fine!
I can't...
remember?
That's a great gift, Rarity.
I hope I can find something for my pony as special as you are.
Uh, she is!
U-Uh, bye!
Hey, Fluttershy!
Thinking of getting that for your Hearthswarming Helper?
[overacted]
I wish I knew what my secret pony wanted.
She's so hard to shop for.
Rainbow Dash.
Great idea!
We should trade ponies!
Well, Applejack said it's not against the rules.
And you know what Rainbow Dash likes, so it's perfect.
[gasps]
Rarity?
What a surprise!
[chuckles]
Thanks!
I can't wait to give Rarity her gift.
It'll be just as special and beautiful and amazing as she is.
Just imagine when she opens it and sees...
uh, sees...
I have no idea what to get her!
[sobbing]
Shopping for Rarity.
No problem.
She likes lots of stuff.
I just need something special.
[gasps]
Oooh...
Wow!
Awesome!
Shopping for Rarity.
Slight problem.
She likes lots of stuff.
But nothing is special enough!
Making a gift is way more personal than buying it.
[blows]
Rarity loves things that take time and effort.
I'm sure this one will be the one that works.
[yawns]
I just need to...
stay focused and...
[snoring]
Coming!
[gasps, chuckles]
I fell asleep.
On somepony's present.
Aah!
Is this honestly the best plan we can come up with?
[grunts]
I'm okay if he doesn't want to chase me anymore!
There's one gift left, but I messed up, too.
Your present's only kind of finished, Rarity, but I guess it's better than nothing.
I wanted to get you the best gift ever.
I just couldn't figure out what it was.
Oh, uh, hey, Rarity.
I picked up that fabric you asked me to.
Anything else you need?
[panting]
[groans]
I've tried everything!
Poultices, soup, a poultice made of soup.
But nothing's helping Twilight get better!
Uh, I wouldn't do that.
Told ya.
See?
We gotta do something to stop Twilight from sneezing magic!
Uh...
what'd she say?
[grunting]
[straining]
And by few, she means slightly less than I'm able to lift!
[grunts]
[grunts, sighs]
It's my top priority.
Have fun, everypony!
[grunts]
Ugh.
See ya!
And remember, whatever happens at the Rainbow Festival, I wanna hear all about it when you get back!
