What?
No, no no, it's all wrong!
The ponies are all supposed to get along, remember?
It's like in the olden times when all three pony kinds were friends.
And they never used their magic against each other.
No, I'm not!
They wouldn't do that!
Those are lies!
Hitch, tell him!
Sprout, stop it!
I'm gonna tell my dad!
You're going to break them!
Dad, tell them that's not what they do!
Freshly baked!
Mmm!
[giggles]
[sighs]
Hitch and Sprout still don't believe me.
Well, when I grow up, I'm going to show everypony that we are right.
Yeah!
And someday, the both of us will meet unicorns or a pegasus, and we'll be best friends forever!
[gasps]
Where?
Where?
[giggles]
Wheeee!
I'm soaring through the sky!
Wait!
Dad!
I have an idea!
Can we send it?
[giggles]
Can you tell me the story?
Pleeeeease?
Unicorn!
As bright as the sun.
To learn about friendship!
Earth ponies, Pegasuses, and unicorns!
Wow!
You finished it!
It's beautiful.
I wish I had a friend who could fly around or float things.
Why can't we be friends anymore?
Goodnight, Daddy.
Goodnight, friends.
Perfect.
Today's the day, Dad.
I actually have a plan this time.
Wish me luck!
Morning, Sheriff Hitch.
I see you brought the whole squad along again.
So, what's up?
Hey, I'm headed there right now.
Hey, Hitch... come on.
Oh, hey, Sprout.
You okay?
You seem kinda wheezy.
Look, you have nothing to worry about.
I'll just go into the factory, deliver my smoothies
But I... Okay, okay.
I'll try.
Earth ponies of Maretime Bay!
Fear is not your friend! But the unicorns and Pegasi can be!
Let's extend the hoof of friendship!
That is not what I meant.
Peace with Pegasi!
Unity with— ah! unicorns!
Hey! Gimme that back!
Peace with... Pegasi!
Whoa!
Huh?
Oh, no.
Whoa!
Peace with Pegasi!
Unity with unicorns!
CEASE FIRE!
Aren't you tired of being scared all the time?
The truth is we're not in danger.
It's all a lie.
We don't need any of this Canterlogic junk.
Everypony needs to hear this!
Everything you believe about Pegasi and unicorns is wrong!
They used to be our friends and can be again!
I'm sure you're about to tell me.
Exactly!
Other ponies look up to you!
You can help!
You just said everypony.
That includes Pegasi and unicorns.
I wish you were here, Dad.
What's going on?
What's happening?
Unicorn!
I've gotta get you out of here!
They're not playing!
They're terrified!
You're a unicorn!
Earth ponies hate unicorns!
Let's go!
There's... a unicorn... in my house... This is so cool!
Wait, no, it's bad.
Very, very bad.
What have I done?
Whoa!
Hey!
Be careful where you point that thing.
Well, I, uh... um... sorta don't want to get zapped with a wayward laser beam.
But of course you know that already.
You've probably been reading my mind this whole time.
Isn't it supposed to glow, by the way?
Or does that only happen when you levitate stuff?
Wait!
Don't answer that yet.
Let me get my notebook!
Okay, wow.
Okay.
A hundred forty-two questions for a unicorn.
Question number one - where do you live?
I knew it!
Do unicorns really live in trees?
Do they eat pizza?
If so, what toppings do they like?
If not, why not?
Can you actually fry pony brains with a single horn zap?
Can you make this float?
Wait.
You don't have any magic?
This is bad.
How sneaky are you?
I can work with that.
Okay, I'll distract them.
Wha—?
N-No, no!
You don't have any magic?
No magic?
Huh.
I am on the run with a unicorn who has no magic.
What are we gonna do?
What are you doing?
Thanks.
Wait, what?
What else do unicorns say about Earth ponies?
Charming.
Wait.
I've got it!
Izzy, we're going on a quest... to Zephyr Heights.
Yes.
We need to find out what happened to your magic and bring it back.
They have magic.
Maybe they can help.
What if you're wrong about them?
Earth ponies were wrong about unicorns.
They could welcome us with open wings.
My lumi-what?
Huh?
Hurry!
Aah!
What's it like to fly?
Is your wingspan the same as your height?
Do you need a license to fly?
How far can you go?
Do Pegasi wear horseshoes, or do they just weigh you down?
Do you see anypony flying here?
Excuse me, Majesty?
Um, we only want to ask you a few questions about magic.
What?
N-No, no!
But-but, your Majesty, I just wanted to ask you a few questions, please!
What else could go wrong today?
Something is not right.
We haven't seen a single pony flying, except the royal family.
Izzy, are you listening?
Princess?
Okay, Zipp.
I'm Sunny.
And this is my friend.
That's why we're here.
Maybe you can tell us how yours works?
My journal!
Thank you, Zipp.
I-I never thought I'd see it again.
It was my father's.
Why?
Princess, why isn't anypony flying?
Oof!
Where are we?
This is proof!
All pony kinds did used to be friends!
My dad was right.
It must be really weird being the only Pegasi that can fly.
Faking it?
But... but how?
Wow!
Oh, my stars... What is that?
Hmmm.
Where's the Unicorn Crystal?
Look!
These two crystals belong together.
United.
Maybe you lost your magic because the crystals were separated.
And all three pony kinds will get along again!
Then that's where we'll go next.
After we get the Pegasus Crystal from your mom, of course.
So, what do we do?
Easy-breezy.
Sure.
Aah!
No, no, no!
Shhh!
Shhh!
It's okay, don't be scared!
Yes!
Zipp, hurry!
Hitch, what are you even doing here?
We had to get the crystal.
Look.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
It's not here!
We have to go back!
That's the tree from the map.
That means... it's this way.
We're almost to the river, everypony!
What are we gonna do?
Everypony, stop!
We're gonna get to the other side, find the crystal, and bring back magic!
And once we do, you'll get to fly, you'll get your fans back, and you'll have me in custody!
Everypony happy now?
Come on, everypony!
What have we got to lose?
Come on.
Do they look like enemies to you?
If that's what you want.
But you should know I'm actually glad you're here, Hitch.
We all are.
So I think we should set off at first light.
Last stop – Bridlewood.
What's wrong, Izzy?
But, Izzy, you'll get your magic.
I made it with my dad.
We always promised each other that someday we would prove that all ponies were meant to be friends.
We'll do our part. Hoof to heart.
We don't have time for that right now.
If we're gonna get the information we need on the Unicorn Crystal, we can't stick out like sore hooves.
We need to look like unicorns.
So, Izzy, can you do it?
Whoa!
These other unicorns seem so different from you.
The Crystal Tea Room?
That's great, Izzy!
Oh, and Hitch?
So word in the forest is you collect crystals.
Who's Alphabittle?
There it is!
I've got an idea.
Maybe I can beat Alphabittle at his own game.
Got it.
Okay.
Be cool.
Tea. Hold the milk.
Quite the game player, I see.
I don't play. I win.
Yeah, it is.
And I challenge you... for that!
Only one way to find out.
I think you'll find I'm average height.
Tick-tock. What do you say?
Special enough for ya?
Don't worry.
I could solve that cube puzzle in my sleep.
He won't.
Trust me.
Deal.
Now give me that cube.
The ultimate what now?
A dancing game.
Seriously?
Focus.
Ohhh.
Here goes nothing.
Oh, I'm feelin' it.
I'm feelin' it!
We won.
We won!
We actually won!
I know it doesn't look like it, but we're here to help.
But I won.
Go, go, go!
Let us explain!
NOPONY HAS MAGIC!
But we're here to bring it back.
I know it sounds unbelievable, but please, just let us try.
Ready, Izzy?
We can try it again!
Maybe... Maybe w-we did it wrong somehow.
Wait.
Wait, don't go.
Oh, come on.
Work.
Work!
Please work!
Come on!
I... I thought it would work.
I was so, so sure of it.
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.
I thought that I could make a difference.
But everywhere I go, I just make things worse.
I'm so sorry I let you all down.
Hitch!
Hitch!
I figured it out!
But we can bring magic back!
Bring friendship back!
We have to warn them!
What are you guys doing here?
You're all in danger!
With magic!
Quick!
I need your crystals!
There's a third crystal!
Follow me!
Where are the other crystals?
Got it!
We need the Unicorn Crystal!
Izzy!
No, no, no!
I understand now.
It's not the crystals that need to be brought together.
It's us.
We can bring back everything that was lost, but it's up to us.
We can stay separated by fear and distrust, or we can choose friendship.
We can choose love.
That's the true magic.
What?
Aah!
Whoo!
I can't believe it!
We did it.
Together.
