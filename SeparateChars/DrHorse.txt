Well now, what seems to be the problem?
All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we?
Widdle guy not feewing too good?
Who's a brave widdle boy, huh?
Who's a brave one?
Well, I think I know what the problem is.
He's a dragon!
Well, that would explain it.
Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies.
Maybe you should try a vet.
All right, Zecora.
Let's have a listen to the old ticker.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Well, that wasn't a good sign.
Mm-hmm.
We're looking for any color other than red.
Oh, it's just as I thought.
I'm afraid you have a very rare disease called...
[echoing]
Swamp Fever!
Unfortunately, very little is known about the disease.
Except, of course, its symptoms ?
change of coat, coughing bubbles, shock sneezing, confusion, and the last stage, the afflicted turn into the very trees that drop the disease-spreading flower.
A cure has yet to be discovered.
I'm sorry, Zecora.
It's a lot to take in.
I'll leave you two to discuss.
[coughing]
Please tell me you found the cure!
[sneezes, sneezes]
