Luz, you ready for the field trip of a lifetime to the one, the only, Emperor's Castle!
But you're gonna miss out on all the cool stuff!
It shows you which path will help you become your best self!
Oooh.
Let's go, Luz!
But you can borrow it!
Finally, I'm about to become my best self!
Wrong move, Lilith.
It's two against one, and you don't stand a chance against Luz!
Something amazing is happening today!
Those are the main nine covens, but there are hundreds of other ones you can join.
You've been taken in by the allure of the Illusionist Coven.
We like to magic with a hint of showmanship.
It's the Emperor's Coven!
Do you think they'll sign my forehead?
Yeah!
And she can win it all!
Yeah-yeah!
Please hurry!
Oh, man, this is it!
Ladies, gentlemen, and assorted demons!
It's almost time for our main Grom event.
Please, please, take a seat, and be aware that the first three rows are designated splash zones.
I see we've got Principal Bump in the house!
Now, sir, I hope you won't throw us in detention because, uh, we're going to raise the roof.
Now, introducing our Grom queen.
You know her, you love her... you've at least heard of her.
Luz, the Human!
And there she goes, folks!
Using that characteristic human magic to keep Grom at bay!
And now, to hand things over to my co-emcee: King!
King!
What's going on, little dude?
The thing is, you're sitting in my personal chit-chat zone, which means you gotta talk.
GROSS!
Why would you do that?
No, King, sometimes you just have to face your fear, like Luz is doing right now.
King, now's your chance.
You gotta pander.
You did it, buddy!
And she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account.
Are you serious?
This was on my bucket list.
After owning a real human bucket!
Oh, look!
The moon is rising into place.
And the celestial powers only align once a year.
Yes!
I've got leaves in my pants... and I like it.
And look at all these human treasures... and actual humans!
We've got a bucket!
Like this strangely buff little man?
Tonight he shall be risen!
Figurine.
That's your cue, little man.
Little buff guy, what did you do?
He's in some kind of trance!
Figurine!
How'd we do that?
This is amazing!
What do we do now?
On the other hand, we've got a giant walking house and should totally take it on a joyride!
It's Boscha.
That girl who made fun of us.
I've never pranked anyone before.
And now I have a taste for it.
Amity's updating her Penstagram.
Uh, my insides didn't.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Is this really what you wanna be doing with your life?
Tossing kids from cliffs?
Guys, is now the best time?
No, not at all.
I know what I'm about.
This tree can't hold us much longer.
If you're gonna eat me just do it now.
Do it now!
Willow, you would not believe humans.
Did you know that humans nail barbed wire to their kids' teeth?
But why?
Maybe to make them magnetic.
I can be spool... I mean, cool.
No, it, it couldn't be.
Where are your gills?
Call me it.
Wow.
Gus.
This is the best day of my life.
I've gotta get to spelling class.
See you guys at lunch!
Hey.
Do humans eat PB&J's?
Oh, my.
Oh, man, what a rush!
Wait, Principal Bump!
Uh, high five!
Run!
Last we saw, she was asking Bump if today could count as extra credit.
Uh, about that.
You're kinda, sorta... banned.
Uh, you high five with your hands, not your head.
You sliced it off!
You sliced off your own thumb!
But what about the thumb?
Hey, Luz!
Boo.
We figured it's a trap since we squashed his stand with a walking house.
It's like a human Ferris wheel but it gives you long-lasting nightmares.
Does the little guy wanna win a prize?
Uh, does he?
Uh, does he?
But we haven't gone on any rides and there's no line for the bumper carcasses.
Or the triple swing.
Does the little baby boo miss his buddy Luz?
Uh, does he?
Uh, does he?
First, I'm growing out of my clothes.
Now I'm shrinking?
Dang, puberty.
You're the craziest coaster of 'em all.
What happened to us?
Did I black out on the molar coaster again?
And I just got tall enough for the rides!
I think we're safe now.
It's so hairy.
Why is it so hairy?
We can't keep doing this.
And now I can't go on the big boy rides!
You monster.
Um, Luz, I think King is broken.
Well, if I have to go, at least I'm with my best friends.
We're on a roll.
Yeah.
I've always wanted to own a jagged piece of cheap metal.
Behold.
The wonders of the human realm.
This little fella's one of their most valued objects.
It aids in the compiling of printed wisdom, the scratching of gunk from under your nails, and my favorite...
It even mimics the sounds of the human ocean.
Aah!
The human realm.
So beautiful.
It's safe to say that the pay-per-clorp is a stunning testament to human ingenuity.
Any questions?
Shh.
He didn't mean that.
Well, this isn't your club.
Thankfully.
These are fakes.
What if I brought in an expert?
How about a real human?
Well, she's busy.
She's got a job.
But I'll bring her in tomorrow.
She'll prove I'm right.
It's okay.
I come from a long line of dweebuses.
Luz, a-about the ban, I, uh, used my presidential authority to pull some strings.
You've been given a full pardon!
I got the ban lifted!
Great!
I'll see you tomorrow!
Yes!
You did it, Gus!
You did it, Gus?
You're the smartest, you're the best?
I always forget you're there.
This is gonna work out after all.
Well, I feel like I took care of any potential problems.
You don't understand.
The members were going mad.
They were bloodthirsty.
They were touching objects.
I had no choice!
What wanted posters?
I also got this.
To keep her undercover.
Behold your new cowl.
Yep.
Put it on.
Hide your ears.
Wanna keep you under wraps 'till the big reveal.
That's my alarm.
Uh, we better get going.
See you after school, Willow.
Well, they kinda showed up after your last visit.
They smell trouble.
Okay, time to run for no particular reason.
Psst. Psst!
Not just any human.
An expert human.
She's here to authenticate your treasures.
See you at the meeting.
I should feel bad about dunking on one of our own members.
We don't have time for this right now.
We gotta get to the clubroom.
Yeah, next time.
Oh, wouldn't you know?
We suddenly have time for a full tour of Hexside.
This is where we play the sport.
The Plant Homeroom.
And this is where I spend my time.
The Illusion Track Homeroom.
That's one of my illusions.
Takes notes for me when I'm not around.
He doesn't always do what he's told.
Yeah.
I moved up a couple grades.
Time for the HAS meeting.
Luz, will you inspect the items?
You have a place here in the HAS.
I don't know!
I've never been in detention before!
I was afraid.
I acted stupid.
Being younger than everyone is hard.
You're overlooked.
Ignored.
But at the HAS, I mattered.
I could make sure no one would ever get left behind.
I didn't wanna lose that.
I'm sorry.
Let me make it up to you, Luz.
I've got a plan.
By leaving no one behind.
Oh, I'll use magic.
Or the illusion of a plan.
We're gonna have to bust down the door.
Wait, Principal Bump.
Don't blame Luz.
I told her the ban was lifted.
We were fighting over the Human Appreciation Society.
I brought Luz in because I wanted to win.
This is all my fault.
Yes, Principal Bump.
I would.
Wanna finish off that tour?
You did it, Luz!
Sorry, I was, uh, covering all my bases.
See you later, Luz.
You know what?
I'm uh, I'ma just get rid of these.
What's going on?
We didn't see you in any classes.
You'll learn less than you did before.
Don't worry.
We'll get you out, dead or alive!
Okay.
Maybe she already booked it.
She did say she was better than this place.
Man, this guy can sleep through anything.
I'm gonna test that theory.
We have an expert disguise!
Hop in!
It's got holes for your gangly teenage legs.
And this way the inspector won't see you either.
Incredible.
That is a fair question.
Here's another question.
What the heck is that?
Time for a power-up!
Do the right thing, ya dingus.
Sadly, this is one problem crime can't solve.
My interview for journalism class is due tomorrow!
I'm supposed to choose someone interesting, accomplished, and noteworthy.
People aren't meant to be all those things!
Curse your need for perfection, Gus!
This is serious journalism, Willow.
Clowning around will get you nowhere.
I'll admit, this amnesia spin has piqued my interest.
Hexside Free Press!
What's going on here?
I'm running out of time.
Ugh.
I'm in total free fall!
Must I turn to forbidden sources?
Aah!
No one can give me the interview I need, except... myself!
Then die you shall!
What do you think?
Aaa!
I will choose one of you, but which one?
If you want to get picked, you'll have to impress me.
If you want this interview, you're gonna have to start answering some tough questions.
Where were you born?
What'd you eat for breakfast this morning?
What's your greatest strength?
This will be the single greatest interview of all time.
So if you want it, you'll have to dazzle me!
Yes, that was nice.
Well, this has been the hardest choice of my entire life.
But with the public interest in mind, the interview goes to Hooty!
Well, your performances got me thinking.
What could create such interesting people?
Only the Owl House itself.
Tell me everything, Hooty!
Hooty, you gotta stay on track here buddy!
I can't take this anymore!
Ooh, a shiny cookie.
Seriously, what's going on here?
In seasons past, these flags have waved in support of Grudgby greats.
Now they will wave for the greatest: Me!
Well, there's a ball, and you score by getting the ball through the other team's goal.
Oh, I get it now.
Wait, were we just having a tea party in animal jammies?
I, I think something's broken.
My flags!
I never should have tried to play.
You were always enough for me.
Okay.
These are flags of surrender now.
You lost me.
Can we resist the call to action?
May the flags be raised once more.
Can we have another montage?
Willow!
Are you watching?
And we'll be here to save her when she needs us!
Do you think she got caught?
Dad, you have to stop!
Let Eda go!
And that's why we try not to keep our lunches in the lockers.
You're just mad that she dropped your class.
Give her a chance!
You can do this, Willow.
Don't let him beat you down.
Yeah, weird we've never seen you around.
What's your name?
Hey, I don't know what kinda mission you're on, but it's been a tough year for Willow.
And she's really looking forward to making this team a thing.
Don't mess this up for her.
Let's try this one more time!
So I can't fly like everyone else, but my way's more fun.
Oh, what was that?
Go, go, go!
Yeah, I shouldn't have been so suspicious.
The WHAT?
FRIENDS don't stab each other in the back.
He's worse than my dad.
Yeah, I know, I guess we'll just have to go home.
Well, it's been fun.
See you around, Luz the Human.
More like he begged us to come because he's terrified of getting recognized.
Eda was rummaging through her basement, and gave us some soothing human noises.
That was a few months ago.
She is shockingly strong!
Hooty, we're not gonna make Luz listen to 24 hours of whale noises.
What even is a whale?
It looks terrifying!
It's human music and it's soothing!
These two are train whistles in a thunderstorm and soothing opera screaming.
Luz!
You're okay!
Witch puberty.
That's cool, I just hope it helps Eda learn my name.
She keeps calling me Goops.
It's already spreading...
No, please!
Wait wait wait...
It finally happened!
Our memorable adventures caught up to us.
Oh, my dad can't find out about this!
(picks up leaf) I guess I'll have to start surviving off the land.
This is impossible!
Gus chomp!
That's right, we'll get back into Hexside or die trying!
Not with that attitude.
Ah, this is hopeless!
Nothing is working!
Help Luz!
Let me go!
No please, no!
Luz!
Save me!
No no no, I'll distract them with illusions of beautiful lady guards.
This could work!
You're stunting my growth as an artist!
Just let me try this!
You know, I think he does it cause he's shy.
He's just evil and shy.
It happens.
Maybe he's so handsome people have a hard time focusing on what he says.
I get it... I can relate.
Luz!
You've seen Belos up close.
What's he like under... all that?
Did you visit your mom?
Does she know about high-fives too?
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
Dad wants me to become a master illusionist, but that's easy.
So instead, I'll become an ambassador to the human realm and re-establish contact with the giraffes!
Would you still train to be a witch in the human realm?
What about all those hearts?
Hey.
You should say something.
You mean the real you.
I remember you!
Wait, get back here!
What are you doing here, Golden Guard?
I'll ask you one more time.
What are you doing here, Hunter?
How... vague of you.
Do you know where Luz is, by any chance?
I'm not sure what you're going through, but that much Hex Mix can't be good for your stomach.
Stop!
Don't trust him!
He's hiding behind an illusion!
You were gonna trick us into getting sigils!
No, no, stay back!
I said, stay..
BACK!
My spell, it's still active.
No, I- I don't know how, I've never made one this big before.
Hunter, why'd you save me back there?
From getting a sigil?
Don't those guys work for you?
When we first met you were trying to trick me into joining a coven.
No sandwich is that good.
Come on, if we wanna find a way through this, we need to trust each other.
What's going on with you?
Hunter!
Follow me!
Hey.
Try to breathe.
Like this.
Did you run away from the Emperor's Coven?
Not too long ago, when I showed a little talent and started taking more advanced classes, it always felt like anyone who wanted to be my friend had an ulterior motive.
Until I met Willow.
And, eventually Luz, and some others.
So yeah, not everybody's great, but not everybody's bad either, y'know?
For what it's worth, you can trust me.
I promise not to mess with you.
All right, tough guy.
Let's keep moving then.
Yes!
Yeah, we made it through the illusion!
High five!
Willow!
You're okay!
Oh, don't worry.
It's cool.
He helped me escape from Graye.
I think he ran away from the Emperor's Coven.
Also, he hasn't showered.
In a while.
Be nice.
Okay, let's get moving.
What are you doing?
Willow's on our side!
You've done it again, Augustus.
You can't even tell Willow apart from the fake one.
Yeah.
It's all my fault.
Ah, stop!
Wait, this hurts!
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I learn?
I let myself get tricked... again.
Everyone thinks I'm the smart one.
So why do I keep acting so dumb?
I can't even trust myself anymore.
Me too.
Just go with it.
Yeah.
and I almost went down with him.
Uh... probably?
I-I messed up bad, Luz.
Willow just needed help with this pixie problem, right?
So I thought, oh, that I'll lure them away with an illusion.
But then... I moved up two grades.
What's the point of being good at this if I can't do anything good with it?
Come on, King.
Please?
You need my library card to visit Amity, don't you?
Yeah, okay.
Looking through old newspapers is about all I'm good for anyway.
I-I've just been thinking.
What if it's time for me to explore different kinds of magic?
Wow!
Just wow!
Plants.
Abomination.
Construction.
You guys took down that Slitherbeast like it was nothing.
You're Glandus students, right?
I go to Hexside.
Name's Gus.
That sounds awesome, but I can't.
I promised a friend I'd help her with something today.
Luz!
I see what you're doing and it's really sweet, but I don't actually know any spells besides illusions.
Alright.
I'm in.
Where do we find these Galdorstones?
Yeah, um-Yeah.
Yeah, alright, let's go!
What can the Galdorstones actually do?
Pfft.
I know that.
Which one is this?
Fireball!
Don't worry, Matty.
I got ya.
What did they mean by couldn't handle Glandus?
Huh.
The Phantom Bringer.
Aleth the Vision Creator?
Khari the Mirage Maker.
But these titles are for... Oh no.
Stop!
These aren't ruins.
This is an illusionist graveyard.
What?
Of course it is.
These stones were theirs.
We shouldn't take them.
This isn't right.
I won't let you steal these.
I'm all out of glyphs!
Whoa-!
Uh, It'll just be an illusion, but maybe I can scare him away.
Well, we gotta get out of here.
Now.
Better a stooge than a clown.
Bria was right, illusions are nothing but high-def party tricks.
Thanks, Mattholomule.
It's time to teach those jerks a lesson!
With all due respect, sir, I'd like to try something a little more... creative.
Man, that took a lot of concentration.
There are some limits.
I wish I could repair all the damage they did.
But- there's so much history here!
So, does that mean we're like... friends now?
Jerk.
Hehahah!
Willow!
Hey, Willow!
Willow!
How are you feeling?
Do you have a fever?
Where's Willow?
Willow, you want me to sing for you?
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...
Why are we here?
Willow, is this helping?
Did we do bad?
No prob.
We're practically best friends now.
You've done it again, Augustus.
You've done it again, Augustus.
Why does this keep happening?
Oh, no.
No, no, not this!
Go away!
All of you!
