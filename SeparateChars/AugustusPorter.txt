Luz, you ready for the field trip of a lifetime to the one, the only, Emperor's Castle!
[shoving a book in Luz's face]
But you're gonna miss out on all the cool stuff!
And the Oracle Sphere!
[book shows a white sphere with a two-headed snake on it]
It shows you which path will help you become your best self!
Oooh.
Let's go, Luz!
[steps in front of Willow]
But, you can borrow it!
Me too!
[holding Oracle Sphere]
Finally, I'm about to become my best self!
[tears up, then starts crying]
Wrong move, Lilith.
It's two against one, and you don't stand a chance against--
Luz!
[him and Willow run up to the stand]
Something amazing is happening today!
Those are the main nine covens, but there are hundreds of other ones you can join.
[runs over to the other witches]
You've been taken in by the allure of the Illusionist Coven.
We like to magic with a hint...
[disappears in a cloud of smoke, reappears a few feet to the right]
...of showmanship.
[gasps]
It's the Emperor's Coven!
Do you think they'll sign my forehead?
Yeah!
And she can win it all!
Yeah-yeah!
Please hurry!
Welcome to your first--
Oh, man, this is it!
[offscreen]
Ladies, gentlemen, and assorted demons!
It's almost time for our main Grom event.
Please, please, take a seat, and be aware that the first three rows are designated splash zones.
[encouraging the crowd to applaud]
I see we've got Principal Bump in the house!
Now, sir, I hope you won't throw us in detention because, uh, we're going to raise the roof.
Now, introducing our Grom queen.
You know her, you love her...
you've at least heard of her.
Luz, the Human!
And there she goes, folks!
Using that characteristic human magic to keep Grom at bay!
And now, to hand things over to my co-emcee: King!
King!
[goes after him]
What's going on, little dude?
The thing is, you're sitting in my personal chit-chat zone, which means you gotta talk.
Well, sometimes, you just have to--
[blushing]
GROSS!
Why would you do that?
No, King, sometimes you just have to face your fear, like Luz is doing right now.
King, now's your chance.
[to King]
You gotta pander.
You did it, buddy!
And she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account.
Are you serious?
This was on my bucket list.
[pulls it out and checks it off]
After owning a real human bucket!
Oh, look!
[points upwards]
The moon is rising into place.
And the celestial powers only align once a year.
Yes!
I've got leaves in my pants...
nd I like it.
[rummaging through a chest]
And look at all these human treasures.
[pulls out a skull]
And actual humans!
We've got a bucket!
[bursts through the flowers with an action figure]
Like this strangely buff little man?
[taps the figure's stomach]
Tonight he shall be risen!
Figurine.
That's your cue, little man.
Little buff guy, what did you do?
He's in some kind of trance!
Figurine!
How'd we do that?
This is amazing!
What do we do now?
On the other hand, we've got a giant walking house and should totally take it on a joyride!
It's Boscha.
That girl who made fun of us.
I've never pranked anyone before.
And now I have a taste for it.
Amity's updating her Penstagram.
Uh, my insides didn't.
[whimpers]
[groans]
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
[turns the group so he's facing the demon hunter]
Is this really what you wanna be doing with your life?
Tossing kids from cliffs?
Guys, is now the best time?
No, not at all.
I know what I'm about.
This tree can't hold us much longer.
[stepping in front of Willow]
If you're gonna eat me just do it now.
Do it now!
Willow, you would not believe humans.
[showing her the magazine]
Did you know that humans nail barbed wire to their kids' teeth?
But why?
Maybe to make them magnetic.
I can be spool.
[stammers]
I mean, cool.
[drops his magazine]
No, it, [plays with his ears while staring at Luz's]
it couldn't be.
Where are your gills?
Gus?
Nickname?
Human nickname?
Gus?
Call me it.
Wow.
Gus.
This is the best day of my life.
I've gotta get to spelling class.
[grabs his magazine and a wand before running off]
See you guys at lunch!
Hey.
Do humans eat PB&J's?
Oh, my.
Oh, man, what a rush!
Wait, Principal Bump!
Uh, high five!
Run!
Last we saw, she was asking Bump if today could count as extra credit.
Uh, about that.
You're kinda, sorta...
banned.
Uh, you high five with your hands, not your head.
You sliced it off!
[panicked]
You sliced off your own thumb!
But what about the thumb?
Hey, Luz!
Boo.
We figured it's a trap since we squashed his stand with a walking house.
It's like a human Ferris wheel but it gives you long-lasting nightmares.
Does the little guy wanna win a prize?
Uh, does he?
Uh, does he?
[cooing, waves his finger at King]
[grabs Luz's other hand]
But we haven't gone on any rides and there's no line for the bumper carcasses.
Carcasses!
Carcasses!
Or the triple swing.
Does the little baby boo miss his buddy Luz?
[picks King up]
Uh, does he?
Uh, does he?
[laughs]
First, I'm growing out of my clothes.
Now I'm shrinking?
Dang, puberty.
You're the craziest coaster of 'em all.
[screams]
What happened to us?
Did I black out on the molar coaster again?
And I just got tall enough for the rides!
[sobs]
I think we're safe now.
[hugs Willow]
It's so hairy.
Why is it so hairy?
[yelps]
We can't keep doing this.
And now I can't go on the big boy rides!
You monster.
Um, Luz, I think King is broken.
[facepalms]
Well, if I have to go, at least I'm with my best friends.
And King.
We're on a roll.
Yeah.
I've always wanted to own a jagged piece of cheap metal.
Behold.
The wonders of the human realm.
[picks up the paper clip]
This little fella's one of their most valued objects.
It aids in the compiling of printed wisdom, the scratching of gunk from under your nails, and my favorite...
It even mimics the sounds of the human ocean.
Aah!
The human realm.
So beautiful.
[walks over to the chalkboard]
It's safe to say that the pay-per-clorp is a stunning testament to human ingenuity.
Any questions?
Our newest member: Mattholomule.
[gasps and turns to his list of rules]
Shh.
He didn't mean that.
Well, this isn't your club.
Thankfully.
These are fakes.
What if I brought in an expert?
How about a real human?
Well, she's busy.
She's got a job.
But I'll bring her in tomorrow.
She'll prove I'm right.
It's okay.
I come from a long line of dweebuses.
L-Luz, a-about the ban, I, uh, used my H.
presidential authority to pull some strings.
You've been given a full pardon!
I got the ban lifted!
[grunting]
Great!
I'll see you tomorrow!
Yes!
You did it, Gus!
[dances]
You did it, Gus ?
You're the smartest You're the best ?
[yelps]
I always forget you're there.
[stares at Hooty]
This is gonna work out after all.
Well, I feel like I took care of any potential problems.
You don't understand.
The members were going mad.
They were bloodthirsty.
They were touching objects.
I had no choice!
[pulls the wanted posters out of his bag]
What wanted posters?
I also got this.
[pulls out a cowl]
To keep her undercover.
Behold your new cowl.
Yep.
Put it on.
Hide your ears.
[chuckles]
Wanna keep you under wraps 'till the big reveal.
That's my alarm.
Uh, we better get going.
[drags Luz away]
See you after school, Willow.
Well, they kinda showed up after your last visit.
They smell trouble.
Literally.
[chuckles]
Okay, time to run for no particular reason.
[gasps, grunts as he collects the posters]
Psst.
Psst!
[pulls his ears]
Dazzle.
Not just any human.
An expert human.
She's here to authenticate your treasures.
[takes his crown back, walks past Mattholomule]
See you at the meeting.
As president of the H.
I should feel bad about dunking on one of our own members.
But as a Gus I feel like doing this: [dances]
Oh, oh, yeah ?
Oh, yeah, what, oh ?
We don't have time for this right now.
We gotta get to the clubroom.
Yeah, next time.
[laughs]
Oh, wouldn't you know?
We suddenly have time for a full tour of Hexside.
This is where we play the sport.
The Plant Homeroom.
Bye.
And this is where I spend my time.
The Illusion Track Homeroom.
That's one of my illusions.
Takes notes for me when I'm not around.
He doesn't always do what he's told.
Yeah.
I moved up a couple grades.
Time for the H.
meeting.
Human Appreciation Society...
[twangs the paper clip]
...it is my distinct pleasure to introduce to you...
Luz, the human.
Luz, will you inspect the items?
Mattholomule, you aren't alone.
You have a place here in the H.
Yeah.
What.
Did you.
[prepares to punch him]
Executive action.
[grabs the bell's tongue]
Luz!
Well, I--
I don't know!
I've never been in detention before!
I was afraid.
I acted stupid.
Being younger than everyone is hard.
[makes his way over to Luz]
You're overlooked.
Ignored.
But at the H.
I mattered.
I could make sure no one would ever get left behind.
I didn't wanna lose that.
I'm sorry.
Let me make it up to you, Luz.
I've got a plan.
[grabs her hand]
By leaving no one behind.
[grunts and jumps in the hole]
Oh, I'll use magic.
[pulls out the paper clip and bends it]
Human magic.
[grunts]
Or the illusion of a plan.
We're gonna have to bust down the door.
Wait, Principal Bump.
Don't blame Luz.
I told her the ban was lifted.
We were fighting over the Human Appreciation Society.
I brought Luz in because I wanted to win.
This is all my fault.
Yes, Principal Bump.
I would.
Wanna finish off that tour?
You did it, Luz!
[summons letters reading out BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!
 Willow glares at him]
Sorry, I was, uh, covering all my bases.
See you later, Luz.
[summons letters spelling out GOODBYE FOREVER!
 Willow glares again.
You know what?
I'm uh, I'ma just get rid of these.
What's going on?
We didn't see you in any classes.
You'll learn less than you did before.
Don't worry.
We'll get you out, dead or alive!
Okay.
Alive.
Maybe she already booked it.
She did say she was better than this place.
Man, this guy can sleep through anything.
[grabs mop]
I'm gonna test that theory.
We have an expert disguise!
[grabs a trashcan]
Hop in!
It's got holes for your gangly teenage legs.
And this way the inspector won't see you either.
Incredible.
That is a fair question.
Here's another question.
What the heck is that?
[points]
Time for a power-up!
Do the right thing, ya dingus.
Sadly, this is one problem crime can't solve.
My interview for journalism class is due tomorrow!
I'm supposed to choose someone interesting, accomplished, and noteworthy.
People aren't meant to be all those things!
Curse your need for perfection, Gus!
This is serious journalism, Willow.
Clowning around will get you nowhere.
I'll admit, this amnesia spin has piqued my interest.
Hexside Free Press!
What's going on here?
I'm running out of time.
Ugh.
I'm in total free fall!
[looks at a pile of books]
Must I turn to forbidden sources?
Aah!
[falls]
No one can give me the interview I need, except...
myself!
[creates illusion double]
[rolls up sleeves]
Then die you shall!
What do you think?
Aaa!
I will choose one of you, but which one?
If you want to get picked, you'll have to impress me.
[summons a ball of light]
If you want this interview, you're gonna have to start answering some tough questions.
[to King]
Where were you born?
[to Eda]
What'd you eat for breakfast this morning?
[to King]
What's your greatest strength?
This will be the single greatest interview of all time.
So if you want it, you'll have to dazzle me!
[turns one ball of light into dozens]
Yes, that was nice.
Well, this has been the hardest choice of my entire life.
But with the public interest in mind, the interview goes to...
[dramatic pause]
Hooty!
Well, your performances got me thinking.
What could create such interesting people?
Only the Owl House itself.
Tell me everything, Mr.
Hooty!
Hooty, you gotta stay on track here buddy!
[throws notepad and pencil]
I can't take this anymore!
[leaves]
[grabbing the DVD]
Ooh, a shiny cookie.
[tries to eat it]
[grabs the hair clip]
Here, Willow.
[from inside the trash can]
She what?
Seriously, what’s going on here?
In seasons past, [holds up a pair of flags]
these flags have waved in support of Grudgby greats.
Now they will wave for the greatest: Me!
[waves flags]
Well, [He summons a miniature illusion of the field to demonstrate]
there’s a ball, and you score by getting the ball through the other team’s goal.
[the illusion dissipates]
[raises hand]
What’s a “mon-tage”?
Oh, I get it now.
Wait, were we just having a tea party in animal jammies?
[groans]
I, I think something’s broken.
[pulls out his flags, now snapped, and gasps]
My flags!
I never should have tried to play.
You were always enough for me.
[sobs]
[sniffs]
Okay.
These are flags of surrender now.
You lost me.
Can we resist the call to action?
May the flags be raised once more.
Go Willow!
Can we have another montage?
[gasps and turns to his scroll]
Willow!
Are you watching?
And we'll be here to save her when she needs us!
Do you think she got caught?
Dad, you have to stop!
Let Eda go!
