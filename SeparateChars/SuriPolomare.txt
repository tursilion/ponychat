[chuckles]
I'm so glad you made it, Rarity!
Don't you remember me?
Suri Polomare from the Ponyville Knitters League?
Because I moved here to make it in the big city.
[laughs]
, okay?
Ooh, it's so good to see you!
And now here we are, competing!
[laughs]
, okay?
Oh, I don't need luck.
Would you like a hoof with your things?
My, your collection is gorgeous!
It's alright, but nothing like this!

Hope you realize how fortunate you are to have me as a mentor.
Now get me some coffee!
[chuckles]
Well look who's here.
Here to show off your copycat collection, mm?
Heh.
Uh-uh-uh, you'd best steer clear of Prim for a while.
She's pretty furious.
Isn't that right?
And that is how it's done.
Pretty clever how I convinced her to stay away from Prim, wasn't it?
[chuckles]
Wouldn't have wanted her to find out the truth now, would we?
