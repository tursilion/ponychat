And that's the end.
My book report.
[the snake hisses and bites the doll]
I think I knocked it out of the park.
That's where the backup snakes were.
That was for the Act Three closer.
O happy dagger, give me death!
Now for the final anatomically correct touch, spider breath.
You think that's an impressive trick?
[throws her pom-poms to the side]
Take a look at this.
[turns around to reveal she flipped her eyelids inside out]
Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Don't worry, Mom.
I won't let you down.
[stands up triumphantly]
No more weirdness!
That doesn't count, right?
But I don't like any of that stuff.
I like editing anime clips to music and- and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories.
Yes, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
[watches her leave, then gasps and rummages through the bin]
Where is it?
Where is it?
Tiny trash thief!
[growls]
Stop adorably hopping away, you-- Huh?
[looks around the tent, which is full of old odds and ends]
Whoa.
I thought I had a lot of weird stuff.
[grabs a creepy-looking doll]
But this?
This is impressive.
[gasps]
[gasps; runs out of the tent and grabs her book back]
Excuse me, sorry, it's mine, thank you.
Wah-ah!
[backing away from the cliff]
Oh, no, no, no, no!
What's going on?
[shrieks as a fairy approaches her]
Oh, hello, little fairy.
Are you going to tell me this is all a fantastical dream?
[screams, slaps the fairy into the ground]
Where am I?
Did I die?
Am I in the bad place?
[sits down on a stool]
I'm so sorry!
I just wanted my book!
If you're gonna eat my skin, [offers her arm and closes her eyes]
just make it quick!
Just do it now!
[opens her eyes]
[looks at Eda and laughs]
That's not all it can do.
Here, let me see it.
Voilà!
I'm Luz.
Luz Noceda.
That's kind of a weird thing for another human to say.
A witch?
[peeking over the edge of the table]
Whoa!
Witch criminal!
Aah!
Wh-What?
That's not cool!
[following Eda]
This is crazy.
If I die here, my mom's gonna kill me!
Wait.
What's that supposed to--
[does so, yells and nearly falls off the staff when she sees the ground below them]
Flying staffs, crazy monsters, you're a witch!
What is this place?
A griffin!
I knew it!
Giraffes?
Aaah!
[jumps off the staff]
[stands]
Well, I've had enough adventure for today.
This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about.
So, can you help me get back home?
Whoa!
[looking over her shoulder]
Aren't you worried about those guards finding us?
This place is beautiful!
[puts her book onto a coffee table]
Do you live here all alone?
[gasps]
Ay, que lindo!
[runs forward and scoops King up in a hug]
Eda, he's so cute!
Who's a widdle guy?
Who's a widdle guy?
Is it you?
Is it you?
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't like the sound of this situation.
You mean this little bundle of joy?
So I don't really have a choice, do I?
Where are we going?
[notices Eda's wanted poster on the wall they're hiding behind]
Whoa.
These guys really have the hots for you.
[gasps]
Will I need a disguise?
I've been waiting to use this.
[pulls her hood on, flicks up cat ears]
Meow, meow.
Whoa!
[also grunting as she pulls herself up and in, falling on her face]
[sits up and gasps]
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not a cat.
[pulls her hood down]
Also, I'm not a criminal.
[pacing around]
Wait.
These aren't crimes.
None of you actually did anything wrong.
[pulls out Eda's wanted poster]
You're all just a bunch of weirdos.
Like me.
[exclaims and runs into an open cell, pulling the door down as she enters]
[whimpers]
Don't worry.
I can get you out.
[pulls on the lever, but can't lift it]
My weak nerd arms!
It's not fair that they're all in here.
They just want to be themselves.
Why does everyone think that being a weirdo is so bad?
[takes a breath]
Wait a second.
Is that a...
That crown doesn't give him any powers, does it?
[grins and blushes]
[screams]
[screams louder and longer]
Eda!
Are you okay?
Does it?
[disgusted]
What?
I hate everything you're saying right now.
Okay, we're going now.
Expecto...
flying?
Magicus...
escapicus!
Eda, lend me a hand!
What about you guys?
But-- But I--
[whimpering as she tries to not fall off the staff]
Why are you guys just standing there?
This is your chance to escape!
So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things.
That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome.
Don't you see?
Because us weirdos have to stick together.
[pulls her hood on and mounts the staff]
And nobody should be punished for who they are.
Now, let's get 'em!
Go, go, go, go!
[points at Wrath]
Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace.
[wind blows her hair]
Now eat this, sucka!
Before I go...
[holds out the head of her Azura doll]
I know it's not the same, but...
[removes Azura's crown]
a king shouldn't be without a crown.
[gasps]
Okay.
I know you got your head cut off, and we started some kind of prison riot, but this was the most fun I've ever had.
I don't fit in at home.
You don't fit in here.
If I stay, we could not fit in together.
[she looks at the pamphlet for Reality Check one last time, then crumples it]
I'm not going back to summer camp.
I want to stay and become a witch.
Like you.
[holds her book up to Eda]
And Azura.
Maybe that's because they haven't tried.
If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want.
King, listen to this!
[sits up]
Sorry!
Now that I'll be a student at Hexside, I wanna learn all about it!
I've got a new crush, and her name is Education!
Is it your birthday!
You can have my trash.
Whoa!
Did you know that Hexside was built on the bones of its rival school?
One it literally conquered!
Can you imagine it!
Me, in the halls of Hexside, studying with Willow and Gus and- maybe even Amity!
Amity!
Oh cramity!
We're supposed to meet so I can get my Azura book back!
[runs out, slams door; reopens door]
I love you guys!
[running and looking around]
Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity.
Gotta find that- oh!
[Sees the girl in question, wearing a new outfit.
There she is.
Hey Amity!
Luz is finally here!
[falls on her back]
[takes the book]
So, what'd you think?
[pulls a drawing out of the book]
So fine you drew yourself with Malingale the Mysterious Soothsayer?
This is great!
Maybe we could even start an Azura club at school when we're classmates!
Surprise!
[pulls out the pamphlet]
I'm enrolling at Hexside!
Placement exam?
Spells?
Pff.
Yeah.
'Course I know two spells!
[laughs nervously]
Uh, actually, I have other training plans in a very far away place that I have to go to right now.
[pretends to walk away]
Bye!
[actually leaves]
[slams the front door open]
Edaaaa!
[runs in]
Eda, Eda!
Eda!
[falls]
You have to teach me a new spell right now!
[stands]
But I need to know two spells to get into decent classes at Hexside.
I can make light glyphs.
[pulls one out and activates it]
But at the end of the day, that's the only spell I know.
[falls face-first to the floor]
[muffled]
Yours!
[stands]
Just teach me a spell now.
Any spell!
It can be the darkest evil.
Come on Eda!
You're the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.
How would it look if your apprentice got thrown into the baby class?
Aww, he stamped his little foot!
Yes!
[climbs onto the counter; louder]
Yes!
YES!
[gasps]
It's beautiful!
[screams]
[yelps, runs off]
I'll definitely learn my second spell here!
Gorgeous views, magic in the air.
And best of all, we're completely alone!
[gasps]
[ducks back down, hides her face with her hat]
Forget teaching me a spell, just make me disappear.
Okay, let's do this.
[stands and waves]
Hey guys!
[grabs Eda's jacket]
Be cool!
If they know I haven't mastered two spells, they'll think I belong in the baby class!
Amity!
[slips, poses on the ground]
Wha...
What are you doing here?
Yup!
Powerful spells!
I'm workin' on one that's so crazy!
Eda's a pretty incredible teacher.
Eda!
Can you please take this seriously?
[looks downcast]
[nods]
Okay.
I trust you.
Ugh.
Okay.
I've identified the smells of three different rocks, sorted all the twigs from big to small, and found your glove, and your hand.
[lifts glove off of Eda's detached hand]
So what now?
[giggles]
With all my heart.
[takes deep breath]
Alright, Luz.
Look.
Look with everything you've got.
Focus.
[raises her right hand and speaks through it]
Don't think like that!
Silence, hands!
If I wanna be in the same class as Amity, I'm gonna need to learn magic like Amity.
Shh!
I don't need your validation.
Huh.
Her crosshatching has improved.
Oh man, oh man.
[stands and draws a circle with the wand; gasps]
Yes!
I did magic!
I did magic!
[jumps in place]
Without drawing anything!
This thing is the coolest!
I'm doing magic, what would you have me do?
Eat more snow?
Lick a rock?
Well, it's already helped me.
Just watch what I can do!
Wh...
whoaaa!
Will it accept a heartfelt apology?
[screams]
Eda!
Um...
I...
I didn't know!
But I don't actually...
know any.
What do we do?
But the beast has Eda!
Amity!
Wait!
[gets shocked by Amity's cage]
Stupid island.
[kicks rock]
Ugh!
[sits on the rock, looks at the Titan's Skull]
You were supposed to teach me magic.
But I'll never learn more than this.
Wait.
Is that...
...a light glyph?
But what does that mean?
Whoa.
It means...
magic is a gift from the island.
It means...
...magic is everywhere!
Magic is everywhere!
Woooo-- aaah!
[lands in the snow]
My second spell!
[pops out]
Thank you, snow!
Thank you, island!
Thank you, Eda.
[pauses]
Eda!
I have to save her.
[She gets out of her hole and runs.
That's right.
[pops up with a skull over her face]
Death is here.
[lifts skull]
Just kidding, Luz is here!
Don't worry, Eda, I get it now.
I was so obsessed with learning my second spell, I didn't listen to you.
But now I'm gonna save you!
[jumps away]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[grinning]
Hello!
Magic!
Literally!
Now, forget that, because you and I are gonna have to work together if we want to save everyone.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
[whispers to Amity]
Hey!
You big idiot!
[waves her arms]
Over here!
[screams]
Gotcha!
Now that's my mentor!
[runs up to Eda]
Did you see?
I learned my second spell, I made the connection!
Azura Book Club?
Azura Book Club!
On it, teach!
Ooh, magic 'sghetti.
[tries to touch it]
[stares at the wool adoringly]
I'm worth salt...
I want cloak!
[stares at her intensely]
I think I finally understand why the Emperor wants you so badly.
[jokingly]
He's got the hots for you, doesn't he?
And he won't stop until he's got you...
[droops head]
King!
Get the elixir!
Now!
Hey, your gem!
It's still dark!
[points finger]
The curse has been getting worse and you've been hiding it!
What happens if you use your magic up?
Do you...
do you die?
No, I-I can't let that happen!
I'll do something about it.
I'll find a cure and then--
[sadly pouts with puppy eyes at Eda]
[immediately beams and hugs Eda]
Get rest!
Drink lots of water!
Stay out of the sun!
Lift with your knees, not your--
Poor Eda.
Enemies everywhere, even her own body.
I wish I could help her.
Right.
I was actually gonna stay behind.
I don't like the way they treat Eda.
Like what?
Mmm...
[reading]
The Healing Hat.
Made from the magic of the Savage Ages.
It is said to cure the deadliest diseases...
and heal any curse?
Mmm.
[picks up book]
You've done so much for me, Eda.
Now I'm gonna do something for you.
[hides notepad]
Um, what was that, Willow?
So, Willow...
would you say this Belos guy is like, powerful?
[struggling to open vent, notices Willow and Gus looking at her]
Heh...
Uh, love me a properly ventilated castle!
[gasps, ducks around a corner]
Hmm.
Please don't notice I'm gone, please don't notice I'm-- boarding the bus?
Huh?
Wah!
Guys.
I, uh....
[sighs]
You got me.
But you don't understand.
Eda has this curse and it's zapping away her magic, and--
[almost crying]
Thanks, guys.
I know exactly what we gotta do.
It's time for a heist!
Healing Hat.
Mmm!
You're Eda's last hope.
[grabs hat, which glows]
I-I can feel it!
I can feel the magic flowing!
Now we can cure Eda and get this hat back before anyone knows it's gone.
[laughs]
We need to go.
Now.
[coughs]
Come on, let's go!
[gasps]
Stay away!
If you touch us, Eda will come after you so fast--
I needed that to heal your sister!
Eda!
[yells]
Eda!
Your gem!
[bangs on the bubble]
[gasp]
[gasps]
Eda, stop!
Your magic!
[gasps]
[screams]
Eda, stop!
You'll run out of magic!
Eda, no, no, no!
Please, no!
Eda.
You monster!
Hi, Hooty.
[gasps]
[gasps]
Emboldened by the dishonor Hecate had shown, Azura lifted her staff to the cotton-candy skies and shouted, I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!
 And look!
I drew a flip book.
[flips between two pages]
Pew, pew, pew!
What?
Wait.
I thought you were the King of Demons.
Are you just making this up now?
Well, I can offer you more of this tantalizing book.
Um, Eda?
[zoom out to the empty street]
What customers?
There aren't even any other stands around.
What's going on?
Gus, Willow!
Hey!
A job fair for witches!
Eda, can we go?
[groans, drops to the ground]
[pops back up]
Who's we?
You have a mysterious past!
Now we gotta go!
Okay.
Then you leave me no choice.
[grunts as she tries to shove Eda's hair in the cowl]
Is this cowl really necessary?
Whoa.
Was I even alive before now?
[stops and points]
Ooh, what's that?
Yowza-wowza!
Yowza-wha-a-a?
Wow!
Acceptance?
Comradery?
A sense of belonging?
Covens sound incredible!
Eda, why haven't you ever joined one?
That panel looks popular.
Aren't you coming, Eda?
I get it, Eda.
Covens: bad.
Individualism: good.
But I'm still figuring this world out, so I'm going to go in there and make up my own mind, okay?
[She walks in.
Whoa.
[looks to the side and waves]
Hmm?
You know her?
[gasps]
Mysterious past!
Eda!
Where are you going?
But we haven't even taken the quiz to determine our coven type!
Ooh, a punky potionist.
Uh...
Hey, Amity.
So, funny story.
Not an abomination.
Sorry for the confusion last week.
I-I'm Luz.
The human.
[follows her]
Well, to be fair, you were okay with him trying to dissect me, so--
Well, I'm learning how to be a witch.
I'm receiving magic lessons from a powerful witch and a ferocious demon.
Why are you being so mean, Amity?
[hugs him]
He's a very good boy and the King of Demons!
I'll tell you what, Amity.
[stands]
It's one thing to say I can't be a witch--
...but it's another thing to bully my friends.
Just like The Good Witch Azura said when facing down her rival Hecate at the Bog of Immediate Regret...
I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!
One, if I win, you apologize to King for squashing his cupcake.
And two, you admit that humans can be witches too.
Fine.
Let's shake on it.
That's probably fine.
King, I-I can win this, right?
[whimpers]
[pops up between them]
Eda, I need your help!
I accidentally challenged Amity to a witch's duel, and I think she's going to kill me all the way dead!
[slumps to the ground]
But...
whose blood?
[sits up]
I-Is there a glowy hand thing that happens, or, uh--
I can't believe I'm gonna have to stop learning magic!
Eda?
[grabs Eda's arms]
What am I going to do?
That's cheating!
But I will know in my heart!
Even if I win now, I lose.
[whimpers]
I'm not good under pressure!
[runs]
[panting]
Whoa!
I, uh-- [she does jazz hands]
Magic?
Not dying!
[screams and runs]
[sees the mound]
No, Amity, don't step any closer!
[to Eda]
Spikes?
Amity-- No!
It wasn't my idea to cheat.
And when I found out, I tried to stop it, but--
Amity, wait!
[pats King's head]
You'll get more offerings, King.
[runs after Amity]
[gasps]
Amity...
[walks over]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Yeah, but--
[looks at the ground]
I'm not a witch.
But I'm training hard to be one.
It doesn't come naturally to me like it does for you, so I've had to improvise.
[nods to the notepad]
Did it work?
Can I still learn magic?
Yeah, sorry.
Your legs are just so tiny.
Should we get you more offerings?
[gasps]
Is it love?
How'd you get away from Lilith?
Eda...
Do you think I'll ever be a true witch?
[brightens]
My own witch.
Sister?
Now that's a mysterious past payoff!
What?
You've got parents?
I need to know more!
Come on!
Work this time.
[replicates plant glyph, activates it, gasps when a flower successfully grows]
YES!
Check it out, King: my glyph skills are blossoming!
I see we're getting enough Wi-Fi through the portal for cat videos.
I regret teaching you about the Internet.
Yep, that's not right.
[gulps]
Good enough.
[muffled]
Ugh!
What am I supposed to say?
[sits up; normal]
Hey mom, not at camp actually!
I'm in the demon realm learning to be a witch!
Also, did you know that demons and magic are real?
 She.
Will.
End me.
The demon on my shoulder makes a good point.
Hehe.
[finger guns her friends; kisses King's head]
Don't spend all day watching MewTube, 'kay?
Something's different today.
Did everyone get a haircut?
[gasps]
You guys have a version of prom on the Boiling Isles?
I was kicked out of my last school dance for dressing like an otter, but here, I can be your Grom queen!
No problem, let me help you!
Here, your note.
Man, you got some quick grabbers.
WHOOOO!
Amity, get it, queen!
Don't leave me hangin'!
My first school dance experience on the Boiling Isles.
I can't wait to get overdressed, take awkward photos, push all the buttons- wait, what?
Well, hello.
Don't mind if I do.
Woah!
[gasps]
Medieval torture seems like a strange theme for Grom, but hey--
Right.
Why don't you seem excited?
If it worries you so much, then why don't you tell Principal Bump you want out of this death match biz?
[gasp]
Unless talking to Bump is your greatest fear.
[offscreen]
I'm home!
Guys?
Hey, sweet duds, owl lady!
What's the haps?
[sits on Eda's nest]
Yeah.
It's Amity.
She's kinda freaking out though.
I wish I could, like, take her place or something.
Hey!
I've been learning lots of new spells!
I could totally handle it.
Nope.
I'm not as fragile as you think, Eda.
And I can't be so easily fooled, either.
Fragile.
Eda doesn't know me!
I-I'm brave!
I'm a bad boy!
Ominous footsteps, creepy woods.
This is no problem.
LUZ CHOP!
AAAAAAHHHHHH!
[gasp]
Oh my gosh, Amity!
I'm so sorry!
Did you talk to Bump?
Was it as terrifying as you imagined?
I would.
[stands]
Amity Blight, I'll do it.
I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena.
I'll be your fearless champion!
[weakly]
fearless...
champion..
Hmmm....
Hmm!
[tries to hit him]
Hooty!
No touching!
Amity!
[picks up outfits]
Which should I wear to Grom?
[holds up black dress]
This one says, witch with a dark side.
[holds up otter suit, puts on matching smile]
But this one says, I'm an otter...
with a dark side.
Stop, stop!
Amity, Amity, wai-- AMITY, STOP!
In preparation, I've made a list!
[yelps]
Jerks online who wanna debate!
Human souls trapped in cat bodies!
NOOOO!
I'm lactose intolerant!
My real fear...
is that Eda thinks I'm too fragile to do this!
And if she's right, I'll never be a real witch!
[offscreen]
Nooooo!
So what if I am!
[falls, yelps]
Well, maybe you'll have fun watching me defeat Grom!
I'll take it!
I'm not sure if it's nerves or if I accidentally drank some milk, but something's making my stomach squirm.
Hah!
Yeah right!
You goin' soft on me, Blight?
[to Amity]
Wish me luck!
There you are, Gromarama.
Not too scary.
Ugh, so weird.
You're not coming from a place of intellectual honesty, so debating you would be pointless!
LET'S FINISH THIS!
Human-style!
Huh?
Mom!
What are you doing here?
[drops the flail]
I can explain!
I can't do it!
I can't face my fear!
I don't wanna be Grom queen anymore!
I give up the throne!
[yells]
You're not really my mom!
[turns away]
Eda!
You're right!
I'm not ready!
Amity!
No, your fear!
Who is that?
[gasps]
You were afraid of getting rejected.
Amity, it's okay.
What if I went to Grom with you instead?
That's what friends do.
Sooooooo....
who did you wanna ask out?
Thanks, but...
I'm gonna go to bed.
In the end, I couldn't face my mom.
Maybe I am fragile.
Hmm.
[narrating]
I won't lie.
Today was kinda hard.
[narrating]
And I don't always feel like I'm supposed to be here.
[narrating]
But when things get tough, my friends help me out.
[narrating]
I think you'd like them.
[narrating]
Te extraño también, Mami.
One day, I'll tell you all about this.
That's a cute way of saying text.
Oh boy, cards!
The paper rectangles that old people think are fun!
Uh, Eda?
It's happening again!
Uh, last time this happened, you turned into this thing.
[holds up her phone, a picture of the Owl Beast on screen]
Eda!
Market!
[stands and starts to leave]
[handing the deck to Owlbert]
Take these and fly ahead.
She'll have to follow us.
Is there anything better than people watching in the Demon Realm?
The curse of tiny legs.
Whoa, that is one ominous parade.
[gasps]
Willow and Gus!
[runs up to them]
Heya, friends!
Wait, what's wrong?
Who hurt my babies?
It's conjuring night!
No dorks allowed?
What a jerk!
[scowls for a second]
What's a moonlight conjuring?
Like a slumber party!
We have those!
[pauses]
Like a weird slumber party!
I'm three people-- I mean, we're three people, and we're way better than them!
Whoa.
[slaps the tallest vine, hugs Willow]
Don't waste your time getting thorny over them.
'Cause we're gonna have our own moonlight conjuring.
That's a really weird thing to want, but I appreciate your enthusiasm.
I'll go tell Eda.
Eda, Gus and Willow and I are gonna do a moonlight conjuring and stick it to Amity.
So can we--
Then, maybe they can come to the house and--
But--
So...
uys...
Uhm...
She said yes.
We can do it at the Owl House.
As long as we don't make a mess or touch anything and never bring up that we did it!
[nervous laugh]
You can count on me; I'd never betray your hard-earned trust.
[nervous laugh]
[now has her hood up and closed]
Meow I'm not.
Uh...
[pushes hood down]
Oh, where's King?
Aww, he's so dangly.
[plays with his feet]
Should I really be doing this?
No, no, Willow is counting on you.
[whispering]
Okay, she's gone.
Welcome to, the living room.
We call it that because it's technically living!
The walls are breathing, look.
We've got snacks, we've got weird music!
Gus, my man.
So how does this conjuring stuff work?
Yes!
He's perfect!
Yes!
[hugs Willow]
Moonlight tie...
string...
and I don't know the words!
Guys?
[a book falls on her head]
Did the entire house just hiccup?
The house?
[running up to the door]
Hooty?
Hooty!
Hooty, you have to stop!
Hooty, stop!
Willow, Gus, hold hands again.
On the one hand, we should probably stay put.
Okay, okay, but we gotta be back before the moon sets or Eda will kill me.
Hmm.
[to Boscha through a megaphone]
Hey.
H-Hey you.
You should, uh, stop being so mean to people.
You're kind of a jerk.
But don't you see?
I am no mere house.
Actually, I'm starting to think we should head back.
Shout out to my fellow witches.
#Humans can bite it.
[gasps]
Let's do it.
Is that a...
giant crossbow?
Hooty!
Hooty!
You have to wake up!
Oye, no me hable así!
Willow, will you help me out with Hooty?
Willow.
Did the house stop moving?
Hooty would taste terrible.
If we're not killed now, we will be when Eda finds out about the house.
Whaaat?
That's ridiculous.
You helped bring a house to life.
Amity doesn't know what she's talking about.
Next to Eda, you're the most powerful witch I know.
No offense, Gus.
Everyone, quick!
Oh, no.
I don't mean to step on this victory but we gotta get home before Eda does.
[waving out the window]
Sorry, mister.
Did we do it?
Sorry about all that, Hooty.
Oh, boy.
Oh, man.
I did.
Yes.
[to Willow]
Hey, you didn't have to do that.
[to Willow]
You know, I still kinda wish we got to show up Amity.
[shaking her head]
I don't like this.
[She plugs her nose.
Please don't make me.
So, Eda...
What if we tried some new lessons for my apprenticeship?
Like...
Read ancient scrolls or mix together potions, or-
Wait.
Is there a magic school here?
Like, winding towers, cute uniforms, dark plots that threaten your life kind of magic school?
Oh, hey.
Greasy slime ball.
Actually, if it's okay, [starts backing away]
I think I'll head home and look at pictures of animals that are still...
alive.
Love you, King.
[pets his belly]
You little beach peach.
[continues walking into the woods]
Ugh!
If magic's all about digging for slime balls, maybe I don't have the stomach for it.
[pockets the slime ball]
[looks around]
Mysterious voice of encouragement?
[looks through bushes and gasps]
Little witch girl.
[gasps]
Witch drama!
[gasps]
[screams]
[rubs her leg]
It's okay.
The thorns only went through a few layers of skin.
[squeals and covers her ears]
[half-waves back, then rushes after her]
Wait!
I'm Luz.
And you're Willow, right?
What you did with that flower and those plants, it was...
wow.
[squeals, grabbing Willow]
Like, magic school?
That's so cool!
[lets Willow go]
I'm so jealous.
I have a teacher, but her lessons are a bit...
untraditional.
I bet she wouldn't even let me enroll.
But I wish I could spend one day there.
Hey, wait.
I know how we can both get what we want.
[picks up abomination goo in both hands and splashes it on her hoodie]
Make me your abomination.
I'll get you a good grade, and you can get me into magic school.
It's fiendishly clever.
I saw that girl's thing.
It's just chunks of stuff that talks weird.
I'm chunks of stuff, and I talk weird!
This is a great plan.
Great plan.
Actually, it's for storing treats.
[stands out of the pot]
Ta-da!
I'm an abomination.
I knew an Augustus back in the human world.
We called him Gus.
[hisses as she sinks down]
[peeks out of the pot]
Don't listen to them, Willow.
We can do this.
[punches the lid off and jumps out]
Ta-da!
[grunts]
Blah!
Uh, I may be your abomination, but you're my a-mom-ination.
Oh my gosh I haven't eaten real food in so long please give me some.
[groans as her head falls back]
Whoo!
I'm a sweaty little abomination.
But now we don't have to worry about Amity.
High five!
[demonstrating]
Slap my hand.
It's a human thing.
Uh, viral fame is a worthy pursuit.
Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance.
Chemtrails are real--
[whimpers as she goes to lie down on it]
[shakes her head]
This is all my fault, Willow.
I just wanted to see what a real magic school was like.
It's lovely, actually.
You're Full-Witch Willow.
And you're great.
And someone once told me great witches are resourceful.
[pulls out the contents of her pockets.
You mean that greasy slime ball?
Yeah.
Thank goodness someone told me to hold on to it.
There's the exit!
Whoa!
I'm not leaving you.
Willow!
[sighs]
I can't save you right now.
But I know someone who can!
[runs off]
[running toward them]
Eda!
Your lesson worked!
Keeping junk in my pocket saved my life!
[gasps]
But wait.
My new friends.
They're in danger.
It's true.
I don't believe it.
[hugs Willow again]
Yes!
Whoo!
What about Amity?
Well, I can't wait to see you in action next time I sneak in.
[Behind her, Willow winces.
That would be nice.
But...
I have a pretty great teacher already.
 'Azura,' Hecate began.
'Our paths have crossed only in battle.
But today I stand before you seeking an ally.
 [sighs]
I can't help it.
Azura is able to befriend everyone.
Even her biggest rival.
I wish I had that kind of power.
Okay.
Suddenly the door swung open.
Hmm?
Eda, you got a package.
It looks like a gift basket.
No, not eating that.
Who's the Bat Queen?
Our greatest adventure yet!
Learning about love and life through a child's eyes.
[halfway out the door]
Well, I better get to the library!
Got to go!
Bye!
Huh?
Whoa.
Whoa!
Huh?
Huh.
That was a crazy night.
Ooh.
What's that?
I am in a library.
I will read a book.
[runs off]
Bloop.
Wow!
[screaming]
[screams]
Sorry!
This place is amazing.
[gasps]
I've been caught.
Pretend to be a book.
[poses]
Wait.
[walks forward]
Amity reading to kids?
Amity seems so...
nice and smiley.
[gasps]
Maybe I can befriend her like Azura befriended her rival.
[grunts and ducks down as the kids leave]
Amity...
[stands and leans on a book, making it fall]
Whoop.
Reading to kids.
Wow.
Looks like this sour lemon drop has a hidden sweet center.
[follows her]
Hey, I could help with the kids.
We could take turns reading.
And do voices.
I do the best [robotic tone]
monster voice.
[backs up]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[groans and bumps her fist against her forehead]
So much for befriending rivals.
Who are you?
I am?
[chuckles and blushes]
I know.
But I didn't mean any of it.
I thought we were as cool as cucumbers.
But we're as sour as pickles.
Whoo!
Amity's even madder at me now.
I didn't think that was possible.
Sure.
Bye.
This is great.
First I befriend the siblings then I befriend the Amity.
[squeals and runs off]
I just had the best day.
Cool teens like me.
Call me a library book 'cause they were checking me out.
Aw, Eda, you look so motherly.
[walks over]
How can you say that around this cute little baby?
[recoils]
Whoa!
[putting her messenger bag on]
Parenting sure looks rewarding.
E-Enjoy your life lessons.
Bye.
Gotta be cool.
[rests her arm on the pillar]
Cool?
[shakes her head and facepalms]
[leans against the pillar]
Cool.
[grunts as she kneels down while throwing a peace sign; groans and drops her head]
Huh?
[falls]
[nods]
Mm-hmm-mm-hmm.
Wow!
Standing in a dimly lit lobby.
You guys know how to party.
Whoa.
Wait.
[grabs a book titled Extinct Birds of the Boiling Isles]
The books are all glowy.
Nothing happened.
[runs]
[yelps]
he pages he mend.
But all the while he longed for a friend.
Cute little quackster.
[backing away from them]
I don't know.
[sighs]
I can't do it.
[grunts]
[grunts]
I don't wanna see it.
Oh, wow.
Boiling Isles romance.
That's totally lame.
I mean, unless you guys are into it?
Wow!
That's a good book.
Your clubhouse is like my ultimate secret hideaway.
What?
Isn't that taking it a bit too far?
Hmm.
Well, I-- I don't see any diaries in here.
[half-heartedly looks around]
Nope, nothin'.
Let's just leave.
Wait, are those...
[squeals]
Good Witch Azura books one through four!
You get these on the Boiling Isles?
So majestic.
[grabs a book]
Is this cover hand-drawn?
The diary.
[closes it]
[hides the diary behind her back]
N-Nothing.
Just a Good Witch Azura 5 where she goes through her Goth phase.
Huh?
No, wait.
I know Amity can be kind of cold but no one deserves this.
These are private thoughts.
Let's put it back.
[grunts]
[grunts]
Argh.
It's not what it looks like.
Amity!
[starts going after her but stops]
You're just gonna leave?
But I need to go talk to Mittens.
I mean, Amity.
[rounding the corner]
Amity, wait.
Please, just listen to me.
Huh?
Amity!
Amity.
Huh?
[holding Amity's diary]
Close.
[pulls at the robes]
Is a drawn okay?
I kind of interpreted the descriptions.
Ah, right.
[writing in the diary]
The good witch, Luzura, grabs her trusty staff.
[a staff rises from the pages and she grabs it]
All right, beloved work of children's fiction.
Let go of her.
[chuckles nervously]
Not an Azura fan, are you?
You fiend.
You can't rhyme friends with friends.
Hey!
I was trying to save you.
No, we aren't.
Follow my lead.
[slams her feet against the book]
One.
Two.
Three.
I don't know.
I didn't even think that would work.
I was all like roaaar.
[whimpers as the rest of her limbs are tied down]
Third dimension how I've missed you.
Gulp.
What an adventure.
Thanks for helping clean up.
Wait.
It doesn't make up for reading your diary but would you wanna borrow this?
[holds out Azura 5]
I noticed you only had up to four.
Hi, guys.
I'm...
home.
[smiles at them]
Hooty.
Whoa.
You must be Mama.
Your night looks very successful.
Look at all that money you made.
And look at this cool whistle that scary woman gave you.
[spit drops off the whistle]
I'd wash it before you use it.
I actually got you something from the library.
Good.
Then bad.
Then maybe good?
Ugh.
It's been a little slow around here, but I've got just the thing to attract customers.
And who doesn't like their name in lights?
Is it too subtle?
Hi, Boscha!
Hexsidians!
See anything you like?
It's not funny, Boscha.
[kneels down]
Even if I could, it's not worth it.
You wouldn't understand how to handle teens like her.
Yeah, teens can be sour, but I'm a little sweetie.
Look what I made you!
Did I spell something wrong?
Or did I spell something right?
Well, I don't see anyone right now.
Maybe you're just being paranoid.
You're a powerful witch.
Why hide when you can poof all your problems away with magic?
Then why are you screaming like one?
Hug each other till we pass out?
[hugs King]
We're doing that?
That's possible?
[grabs a VHS box]
This is just like my favorite early 2000s movie!
Freaky Fraturday.
But maybe we should think about this for a second.
Ooh!
[in Eda's body]
Did it work?
I need a mirror.
[runs into the mirror with a grunt, slides down]
Found one.
Oh, my gosh.
It worked!
I'm so old...
[grabs her ears]
and pointy!
Hot dog!
It's me!
Wait, so that means...
Well, I've got magic.
Eda, don't be too mad when your inventory's gone and the guards are none the wiser.
Whew!
Okay, let's try this again.
And strut, strut, strut.
[grunts]
How does Eda wear these all day?
[sees the broken lamp]
Oh, no.
What have my heels done?
Wait a second.
I'm a ding dang witch!
Boy, Eda is powerful.
[yells as magic comes out of her hand]
Not again!
Okay, let's try this one more time.
[coughs, gasps]
I made magic with my hands!
[jumps]
Zippo swappo.
Sold to the savvy shopper.
Okay, magic hands, let's see what else we can magically magic.
Step right up and feast your eyes on the marvels of the human realm!
Was it for laughter?
[magics a feather duster to tickle him]
Thank you!
Come again!
There's a little something for everyone.
Take it from me, Eda, the Boiling Isles' gift to magic.
That depends.
Are you a fan...
[reaches into the top hat and pulls out flowers]
of magic?
[looks between them]
Gentlemen, whaddya say we forget this whole thing ever happened?
Amnesia spell!
Haven't quite got the hang of this yet.
Owlbert!
This is all a big mistake.
[led into an interrogation room]
You're gonna laugh when I explain.
Look, guys, you got the wrong Eda.
Oh, thank goodness!
A familiar face.
You're Eda's sister, right?
Is it Libby?
Limby...
Well, as I was telling the guard, this is just a classic Freaky Fraturday mix-up.
Yeah, I think that list goes on for a while.
I know.
I can't just poof my problems away.
Eda wanted to be in the Emperor's Coven?
The what now?
Wait, you're making a mistake!
[draws a large spell circle]
I'm not a danger to anyone!
[realizes what she did]
Uh-oh.
[coughs]
Owlbert, come to me!
Huh?
[grunts as Owlbert hits her face; stands]
Sorry, buddy.
[frees Owlbert]
Eda's life is more complicated than I thought.
[running]
Okay, if I were Eda and Eda is King, where would I be?
This thing's so confusing.
Eda!
Go, go, go!
What weird stuff did you get my body into?
Sorry.
Eda, I just wanna say that things can be more complicated than you think.
But with you guys, it all feels a little less mixed up.
So, wait.
Who is going to clean Hooty?
It's getting...
dire.
Maybe if we all work together we could--
Aw, man.
So they said I couldn't remove my thumb, but look at that!
[pretends to remove her thumb]
Whoop!
And they say humans can't do magic.
Heyo, dough boy, quit loafing around!
School time!
See you guys in class!
Hey, don't worry.
We'll finish our comedy hour when we get home.
[kisses King's skull]
[singsong]
Try not to miss me while I'm gone!
[closes door]
Apparently there's an infestation of pixies at Hexside, so school's been canceled.
A carnival?
[takes King off her head]
You know, I've been so busy with school lately, what do you say we take this comedy hour on tour?
It'll be a Luz and King day!
[puts an arm around Eda]
Let's all three of us go!
[now in her usual attire]
And smell all the fresh meat!
[sniffs as a fly goes up her nose; coughs it out her mouth]
Fun!
Aren't you mad at us for destroying your stand?
Aww.
It's like a regular circus but adorably small!
[presses her face to the glass]
You're my friends now.
You know what, Eda can pick through my socks all she wants.
Because today is all about having a great time with my partner in crime.
Now this is my kind of weird!
So what do you wanna do first?
We could brave the molar coaster, or eat a mysterious blob...
No, silly.
That's a friendship bracelet.
A weapon of love.
[grabs them and puts them together, forming a heart]
It's basically a declaration to the whole world that you're the best of friends.
Or let's just play the games.
[gasps]
Friends!
Oh my gosh, I didn't think I'd see carniv-y'all here.
Yes!
This mama is ready for trauma.
Oh, yeah.
We're on a very important quest to win a special prize for King.
What do you think, King?
The more the merrier, huh?
All right.
Approval!
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
King!
Sorry we lost you back there, little dude.
Food!
I'm gonna crab some rotten candy while you guys figure this out.
[runs]
Bye!
Wow.
I guess they really wanted to ride those bumper carcasses.
There's something I gotta tell you, King.
[pauses]
I said I'd help you win those friendship bracelets.
So win them we shall, okay?
What was that?
Ready or not, here we crumb.
Now, King, before you spend your tickets are you sure you want those friendship bracelets and not this bad boy?
This guy's a riot.
Ugh, gross.
I'm gonna need a mirror.
I'll be right back, King.
[leaves]
There we go.
You made it.
What a supportive sign.
Wait a sec.
Supportive friends!
Huh?
Oh, my gosh.
King...
What?
[puts Willow and Gus down]
That must've been what did it.
Give me the spray bottle, King.
There's nothing to explain.
[tries to take the bottle]
Shrink my friends?
Why are you doing this?
At least he's still my friend.
That's how friends react.
We've gotta--
--find a way out of here!
King?
You shrunk the animals too?
All thanks to you, King.
[kneels down]
Here.
[hands him four cracked pieces of the bracelets]
It was all that was left.
That's very sweet.
[whisper]
And can I tell you a secret?
I've been missing you too.
[kisses]
You bread my mind.
You coming, Eda?
Gus, I'd love to go to school with you, but I don't know how I can.
[points to her banned poster]
Principal Bump banned me from Hexside.
Well, I would love to go some day.
Better than unpacking boxes in the Eda Coven.
I don't care about T-shirts, Eda!
I want to learn magic, [gestures to Gus]
and they teach that at Hexside!
[sighs and sits on the couch]
You mean...
Oh my gosh.
[shakes Gus]
Yes, yes, yes!
Of course I'll be there tomorrow!
Gus, this will be great!
[jumps on the couch]
I get to see the school and save the president.
Undercover from what?
Whoa.
I love it.
[sniffs]
On the Boiling Isles, new things smell old.
Oh, a showman.
I totally get it.
You bring the razzle, [pulls the hood back up]
I'll bring the dazzle.
Bye, friend.
Be safe.
Make good choices.
That's new.
[trumpets, pulls the hood down]
Ta-da!
Yeah.
I've been doing this for years.
Wow!
Who got the trophy for the most bones?
Whoa!
Okay.
But next time you have to give me a full tour.
Ooh.
It's the abomination professor.
I should introduce myself.
Apologize for the incident.
Hey, Mr.
Abomination Professor.
The abominominator.
Remember me?
[roars]
Ooh.
What's in here?
Willow, hey.
Wait, if you're here, who is that?
Wow, Gus.
You're good.
[recovers, takes the hood off]
Of course, Mr.
President.
Allow me to determine if they're truly of my realm's origin.
[reaches for the shoe]
Hey, man.
It's okay.
You're only human.
Well, you know what I mean.
We've all been the new kid before.
Right, Gus?
No, it's fine.
The ban's been lifted.
Tell 'em, Gus.
[screams as she's dragged away]
Gus!
Tell them!
Help!
[screams]
I don't even learn here!
Where are you taking me?
That won't be so bad, right?
[screams]
[hiding behind a rock]
Gus!
You said the ban was lifted!
[screams]
How is this detention?
This is a death sentence!
That isn't hard to believe.
You're kind of a jerk.
Mattholomule!
[to Gus]
You lied to me.
You lied about the ban!
Why?
Yes, you did!
[puts a hand on his shoulder]
I get it.
I just wish you told me the truth.
[yelps]
[kicks it]
I'm in.
Where do we start?
[screams]
[tries to bite the pod]
You know, it didn't taste as bad as I thought it would.
Oh, you're a witch.
Do magic.
[strains, tosses Mattholomule over her shoulder]
Oh, gosh.
He's so little.
This is part of the plan, right?
A genius and a wordsmith.
Right behind you.
[picks up Mattholomule and follows him]
Eda?
What?
[screams]
[gasps]
Yeah!
Let's go.
[to Eda]
Wow!
Bump was not exaggerating.
You were a terrible student.
[Eda gives off a look of surprise, implying she didn't even know Luz was there.
I-I'm not ready for this Eda.
Maybe we should go back.
But what if...
What if I mess something up?
Or what if I do something wrong?
[gasps]
What if I die?
Eda!
Pumped!
[pulls hood up]
Ready!
[movie trailer narrator voice]
From the humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise.
[normal voice]
I have traveled from another realm and trained with a powerful witch to master dark and forbidden magic.
I am...
[takes cloak off with a twirl]
Luz Noceda!
[chuckles awkwardly, tosses confetti out of a fanny pack]
Confetti!
I sure can.
[zips open fanny pack]
It's said that humans can't do magic, [pulls out papers and shows them to both sides of the auditorium]
but I discovered a lost technique that changes everything.
Uhh...
Um, I can do other things, what about...
this?
[stands, flips eyelids inside out]
Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Ow ow!
Eyelash!
Eyelash!
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
[places hand on an ice glyph]
Whoops!
I failed, didn't I?
[falls on her face]
[weakly]
Hurray.
Mmm, we gotta go back.
This was a mistake!
I'm gonna mess things up again and everyone will see, and-
That's why I'm nervous!
At my human school, I didn't make a good first impression.
This is a chance to be seen as something other than a screw-up.
Aw, I won't be doing that.
But thanks.
Nah, I'll just earn it when I quit showering.
Bye!
[runs off]
Thanks, Eda.
In fact, [pulls sock puppets of her and Eda out of her pockets]
I have written a heartfelt sonnet to commemorate this occasion.
Thanks, Puppet Eda.
Thanks, Amity!
Up top!
[wipes mud off her face]
Blegh!
Wow, my first day at Hexside.
A chance to discover my true magical potential.
And maybe meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman.
King?
Why are you in my bag?
Okay, but if anyone asks, you don't know me.
[walks away]
Hello, fellow Hexoleos!
Hmm, that's what I'm gonna figure out right now.
[goes inside]
See you on the other side, friends.
Hiya, Princy-B!
Can I call you that?
Actually, Principal Bump, I've made my own schedule.
[unfurls a scroll]
First, Vet Care for Mythical Beasts, then Healing and Dealing, and then after lunch-
Then I'll be the first.
But all the tracks are so cool!
Is there some sort of enchanted article of clothing that could sort this out for me?
I don't know if I can choose just one.
Oh, I guess I have always liked pouring things into other things.
See, potions are fun!
[pours test tube into cauldron]
You could spend the rest of your life studying this, right?
The Oracle Track!
The Plant Track!
[pawing at the window]
Wow!
Sorry!
[stirs her cauldron]
Sorry.
[shudders]
[rotating her shoulder]
Ooh boy!
Stirring is the pits.
What else is on the schedule for today?
Oh, man!
I'm sorry, elbow!
A crystal ball.
Maybe it can show me if I'm on the right track.
No, don't be tempted!
It's your first day.
Make a good impression.
[begins to walk away; pops up at the closet and grabs the ball]
Whoa!
Wow!
Wait, what'd you say?
But I wasn't studying other subjects!
I uh...
fog brew!
[tosses her potion on the ground, which doesn't work]
Yeah.
I figured that wouldn't work.
King!
Vouch for my character!
What is this place?
[gasps]
Nooooo!
Detention track?
But this can't be possible, I-I thought I--
But I'll be back in the human world by then.
Hello, fellow detentioners.
Room for one more?
[looks around]
I like the little spikeys in your hair.
Hey, don't blame any of them.
I'm the one that started talking.
[walks off]
Aw, farts.
I do.
Oh, my gosh!
I missed you so much.
Let me squeeze your faces.
[squeezes Willow's face]
Principal Bump put me in the detention track for mixing magic.
No, I'm better than this.
Please, you gotta help me break out.
Aw, you guys.
It's the teacher.
Gotta go!
[gasps]
It's you!
Whoa.
What is this place?
I'm terrified!
Um, I mean...
I'm Luz.
Whoa.
Aah!
I love secret rooms!
Where do the doors go?
This place is amazing.
I bet you guys can get into so much trouble in here.
You actually like school?
Sounds like Bump's priorities are out of whack.
[reaches for the marker]
Eh, they're probably looking for some other Luz.
No, no, it's not like that.
I just didn't think I deserved-- I mean, none of us deserve--
I understand.
Hey, guys.
[slumps onto the floor face first]
Yeah.
That's right where I belong.
[sighs]
I know, but what's the point if people get hurt on the way?
[runs in front of her friends]
Eat this!
[picks up Willow and Gus]
I'll get you guys somewhere safe!
[bursts into the Secret Room of Shortcuts]
Guys!
I need your help!
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, but please listen!
[falls, drops Willow]
Argh!
Willow...
Something horrible is loose in the school.
It must've attacked the other schools, and now it's come for us.
We have to do something.
Hexoleos are out there gettin' hurt, and we're the only ones who can save them.
We're troublemakers, right?
So let's go out there and make some trouble.
From humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise.
I've trained with a secret society to discover the power of mixing magic!
I am-
Wah!
Viney!
Do the thing, do the thing!
Wooh!
It's all you, Barcus!
He's reading your palm, and your future looks bleak.
[hugs Viney]
You did it!
You were amazing!
You guys--
Yeah it is.
But let's think about this, Principal Bump.
Why would kids in the detention track need a secret hideout?
Okay, you need coven money.
But if you have to hurt your students to get it, what's the point?
They saved Hexside.
They should be allowed to study what they wish.
Oh, I still can't choose.
Maybe it's crazy but I wish I could study a little bit of everything.
Whoa.
What's going on?
What is this?
Whoa-ho!
This is so cool.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna study everything!
[gasps, chuckles]
I shoulda guessed.
[voiceover]
And here we have the most fearsome creature in the world, the King of Demons.
Facing his natural enemy, the ducky sock!
So, why'd you call me here again?
[zooming in with her camera]
And cute little paws.
Oh, you guys are sensitive.
Bad boy!
No, no.
I am so paying attention.
This is my paying attention face.
[nodding]
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[gasps]
I love the rain.
[opens the door, exhales]
I always love feeling the first few drops in my hair.
[kneels down to talk to a flower]
I bet you do too, little buddy.
What?
Huh?
[yelps]
[lying painfully]
Yep.
[groans as a cup falls on her head]
Not hurt.
[squeals, then falls over]
Oh, my gosh, I love you so much.
[looks at Eda, who is creating a spell under a force field]
A boiling rainstorm on the Boiling Isles.
The weather here is so fun.
Wow!
Someday I'd like to be as cool as Eda the Owl Lady.
Magical, sassy, surprisingly foxy for her age.
Hey, why do they call you the Owl Lady, anyway?
You have a nest?
I want a nest!
Nest party!
[She helps Eda up.
[watching Eda enter the house]
This is perfect.
Since we'll be stuck in the house all night, Eda won't have any excuse not to teach me a spell.
[follows Eda]
Oh, uh, sorry, King.
But...
magic.
Oh, Eda, have I told you how rad your fang looks today?
Uh, and your hair is like...
girl.
Please, Eda, please.
How am I supposed to earn my witch's staff if I don't know any spells?
Oh, this?
Nope.
[Eda falls down.
Teach me one spell, and I'll give you your sparkle thing.
Gimme!
[gasps]
Be quiet.
I need to focus.
Uh, from the heart?
[gasps in joy, blushes]
Oh, gross.
Can I keep that?
But how can I, little ol' Luz, do spells if I don't have a magic bile...
sac?
What?
Eda!
That's it?
Wait!
I need to see you do the circle thingy again.
I'll record it on my phone this time.
Smile!
You're on camera.
One more spell won't kill you.
[yelps]
Oh, my gosh.
My obsession with spells knocked out Eda.
I'm a monster.
We should get help, right?
But what if Eda's dead?
Well, we can't just leave her on the floor.
Sorry for pushing you, Miss Eda.
Please don't hurt me when you wake up.
[rubs King's head]
Just let her rest, you little goober.
Come on.
Let's go downstairs.
[groans, trying to draw a spell circle]
This is all she does.
Why you gotta be so cryptic, Owl Lady?
[hits play on the video]
Not now, King.
I want to figure out this spell.
But if I don't have a magic sac, what's the point?
I'll just be twirling my fingers around un-magically forever.
I was a nobody back home.
[sits down]
But becoming a witch is my chance to be someone.
Do you know what it's like to have no one take you seriously?
[puts her phone away]
Oh, yes, yes.
You can teach me about demons all week if you help me learn this spell.
Really?
Thank you so much.
You're a prince.
Right.
[takes the potion and opens it]
Wow.
I can't believe I'm about to learn magic.
Real magic.
This is historic.
Golden elixir.
Gone!
This is awful.
Hooty!
[takes off the apron and runs]
Hooty!
Are you in there?
[taps his beak a few times and checks his eye]
Whatever did this escaped into the rain.
What could survive that?
This is terrifying.
So why do you look so happy?
You want to go toward those creepy sounds?
No way!
[groans]
Oh, my gosh.
Eda!
[runs to Eda's nest]
Eda?
[holds up a damaged pillow]
Slash marks.
King!
You're the demon expert.
I need your help.
King!
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
[puts King down]
I was checking on Eda, and she was gone, and then you were gone.
I also tripped and lost my shoe.
Oh, hey, you found it.
[takes it]
Curse?
Wait, what are you trying to say?
Eda?
Oh, man.
Did you see her eyes?
They were like-- [snarls]
What happened to her?
Well...
[holds out the pen]
let's finish the lesson.
Eda's turned into some kind of demon, and we need to save her.
So who knows more about demons than the best teacher in the world?
I can't.
My camera's all blasted.
[sighs]
You saw me.
I can't draw circles in the air.
I'm not like Eda.
[plays the video]
[gasps]
There's a pattern in the spell circle.
[grabs a leaf and the pen]
It looks like this.
[draws over the pattern]
There.
[gasps]
It's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh.
I just did magic.
[stands triumphantly]
I just did magic!
I just did magic!
I think I know how to get Eda back.
Will you help me, boo-boo buddy?
[offers a fist bump]
I'm sorry, Eda.
But it's for your own good.
Whoa.
So are you okay?
I had some encouragement from a great teacher.
We'll take care of him.
You stay in bed.
[picks up Snaggleback]
Come on, you goopy fella.
We'll set you free now.
Welcome to the boo-boo buddy club, Hooty.
Prepare thyself to do battle like a human!
Thumb war!
Oh my gosh Willow, I'm so excited for photo class!
I can't believe you can make pictures of your actual memories!
[opens locker]
I'ma see me some baby Willow!
Don't eat that.
[pulls at the book]
Whoa!
[falls]
Hiss!
[stands]
That could be anyone!
Alright memory melon, let's pick another juicy one!
Ooo, who says brain surgery is hard?
All the colors of the brainbow.
Whoa.
Photo class is intense.
Oh my gosh, Willow, you had an awkward hair phase, too?
I knew we were meant to be friends.
Ooo there's more!
[gasps]
Hey, I know you and Amity have a history.
Wouldn't you feel better talking about it?
If you won't tell me what she did, I'll never be able to cook up a scheme to make you friends again.
[looks at the photos]
She never did mention anything about...
shenanigans.
Wait up!
Hey there, detective.
Are you solving a crime or about to commit one?
Okay buddy, okay.
[gives Gus apple blood]
So, Willow-- whoa.
Are you okay?
Gus, it really seems like she's forgotten us, like her memory is- [gasps]
Like her memory is gone!
[gasps]
You destroyed Willow's memories?
Yup.
When the night critters allow me to.
Is there anything we can do?
Be still my fantasy loving heart, I have always wanted to do this!
Thank you, Boiling Isles.
Gus...
has a lot on his plate.
Amity, you have to go with me.
You set everything in there on fire!
You have to help.
[takes bell]
Whoa.
[almost falls]
I don't know.
We'll just have to start fixing stuff on our own!
Hmm, now let's see...
[poking it more times]
Hey, I found something magical.
I'ma put my face in it!
[laughs as she enters the picture]
[sticks her head out the picture]
I think I found the memories.
Let's go!
[drags Amity in]
Woo!
[sits up]
And welcome to Willow's beautiful...
memory?
Forts, hooky, Willow.
Can words get any cuter?
Wha?
It's like dog house for angels!
I think fixing the fort fixed the memory!
I know, but now she's more like a great bloomer!
This place is like theater showing her most important moments!
Now let's fix some more!
[runs up to the birthday party picture]
The photo that started it all!
Let's do it next.
Hmm, don't mind if I do!
[laughs]
We don't need to see how this one ends...
[turns the memory around]
Ew...
I mean, aw!
Hey, you okay?
Don't worry.
We've gotten really good at fixing memories!
I won't rest until we've got this all sorted out.
Repeat after me: We can fix this together!
 Come on!
Heck yeah we can!
I know some of these memories must be painful for you, but, what happened to you guys?
And why are you trying to hide it?
Look, if you don't wanna talk about it, just say so.
[walks off]
If you need me, I shall be fixing this memory of a ball pit.
[enters, immediately ducks back out with an egg on her head]
It's eggs!
It's full of eggs!
Why is this memory full of eggs?
[inhales]
Phew!
[tosses egg]
Yeah.
And there's only one last memory to fix!
The one you're suspiciously avoiding.
Amity, you gotta stop being weird.
We have to fix all of them.
Unless...
there's something in there you don't want me to see.
Look, I'm not here to judge, I'm just here to help Willow.
Look!
Oh no!
That thing is burning up all the memories!
Yeah...
she's not super reliable.
Run!
I don't know.
[looks at the swing photo]
That one hasnt been burned, [looks at the holiday photo]
or that one!
[looks at the library photo, gasps]
Amity, that thing isn't after any photo.
It's after you!
Run!
I have an idea!
[shoves Amity to the beach photo]
Just trust me!
Time for a swimming lesson!
Woo!
Teamwork baby!
Please!
Stop!
You're saying it all creepy, but I like the sound of-- whoa!
Where are we?
Amity!
Then, if it's okay, Amity and I still have some work to do.
So, does this mean you and Willow are buddies again?
Well, [pulls out bell]
why don't we go see?
[rings bell]
Whoa.
What went down here?
Where's Gus?
What did you do with Gus?
Those are very mixed messages.
Willow!
Do you know who I am?
She's back, folks!
My girl's back!
I'm gonna hug you so hard you'll never forget me again!
[hugs her]
You said nothing about shenanigans...
My first Grudgby season!
Im so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!
You mean glory days?
Cheating isnt anything to brag about.
How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?
Well, cant reason with crazy.
[pulls a sleeping King out of her hood]
Bye King, you little snoozers.
[to Gus and Willow]
I cant wait for Grudgby season to start!
Ive studied up on all sorts of magical sports.
Like this.
[holds up a DVD case]
Good Witch Azura 2: The Field of Deadly Fates.
A classic underdog tale.
[grabbing the DVD from Gus]
Not food.
Whats going on?
Its like all of Hexsides caught Willow fever!
Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute.
But give that back!
We are having zero fun, I swear.
Boschas picking on us.
Dont worry, its not like she can follow us around all day, right?
She followed us around all day.
She literally followed us around all day!
We will find a way out of this.
Amity!
Amity, we need your help.
Boscha wont stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because shes the Star Captain of the Grudgby Team.
Youre friends with her, can you help us?
Hmm.
Okay, okay.
Im pickin' up what youre puttin' down.
Willow!
What happened?
Thats it!
Boscha!
Willow challenges you to...
a grudgby match!
Im just following Amitys advice.
Boscha only speaks in Grudgby terms.
Trust me, I have a plan.
Thats right!
Well settle this once and for all on the field.
If Willows team wins, you dont get to pick on her anymore.
Thats not even a punishment.
I love water.
But youre the better witch.
I dont know much about sports, but I know about sports movies.
We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy.
With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win.
What about you, Amity?
Huh?
Well, I guess shes out.
In any case, lets get training!
So, how exactly do we play Grudgby?
That sounds easy.
Oh, right.
Boiling Isles.
Should have predicted this.
Alright!
Every great sports story includes a training montage.
Well
What happens in the montage stays in the montage!
Now lets hit the field.
Now for our big finale!
Lets try...
[activates a plant glyph]
the Thorn Vault.
[puts glyph on ground]
Guys, lets try the Thorn Vault one more time.
But were the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and
Willow, wait!
I pushed Willow and Gus too hard.
Its just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on.
Shes one of the best friends Ive ever had.
Winning this game is the only way I know how to help.
Really?
Good Witch Azura 2: Field of Deadly Fates!
You watched it too?
Wah!
Sorry.
[helps Amity up]
I just really love backstories.
[putting something in Amitys hand]
I know what to do to make this up to Willow.
Thanks.
[leaves]
Im here on her behalf.
We forfeit.
And Im here to tell you that Ill take Willows place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need.
[gasps]
Willow!
[runs up to her]
Willow, Im sorry I got you into this mess.
Youre right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.
Nice work.
Whoa.
[gasps]
Fire magic!
[throws ball]
Amity!
Heres what I have to offer.
[holds out fire, light, plant, and ice glyphs]
[gasps]
The Thorn Vault?
Are you sure?
Amity!
Whoo!
[hugs Willow]
You did it, Willow!
We did it!
We Won!
Wait, what?
Wh- What happened?
The what?
That just invalidates all our efforts!
If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else?
Theres no reason to watch any of the other players!
Thats such a stupid rule!
Are you sure?
I could help carry you if it really hurts.
Aaaaand, scoop!
[she picks Amity up]
Yeah!
Montage, activate!
[chuckles]
[rolls over, breathes heavily]
Stop adorably hopping away, you...
Huh?
[gasps]
[wakes up with a gasp and looks around the room]
It wasn't a dream!
[opens the window]
Good morning, terrifying fantasy world.
Ughhh.
[picks up King]
Good morning, you little cutie-pie.
[kisses his head repeatedly]
Yes, you are.
[hugs him tightly before putting him back down on her sleeping bag.
[screams and karate chops Hooty's face]
Sorry, Hooty.
[Looks at the bathroom counter and picks up her Azura book.
Flips it open to a headshot of Azura and holds it up to the mirror]
This is it, old girl.
Your first day on the Boiling Isles, as a Witch Apprentice.
[punches the air]
Hyah!
[opens a closet door while covering her eyes]
Please have witchy clothes.
Please have witchy clothes.
Please have witchy clothes.
[takes her hand off her eyes and sees a closet full of stereotypical witchy stuff]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[screams]
[squeals]
Good morning, Eda the Owl Lady.
I am ready for my first day of Witch Apprenticeship.
Huh?
[stares in horror as her name tag falls to the floor]
[following Eda into the kitchen]
Remember me?
Luz?
[grunts as a coffee cup hits her in the back of the head]
We freed the oppressed and defeated the evil warden together?
Yesterday?
You mean apple juice?
Teach me some spells.
When do I get a magic staff?
Was I supposed to bring my own runes?
[gasps]
Do you have a dangerous magical quest for me?
More than anything.
[pulls a bottle from the bag and reads the label]
Snake oil.
I won't let you down, Miss Eda.
Uh...
[squishes her face against the window]
No, I won't.
Woah!
I've only seen places like this in my dreams.
It's incredible.
And I'm the only human here?
Wow!
There must be a reason for that, right?
Why am I here?
What if I, Luz Noceda, average teen, actually had...
[gasps]
...a predetermined path of greatness?
[gasps]
Just like Azura!
Today I'm delivering packages, but tomorrow I'll be earning the respect of everyone on the Boiling Isles with my magical prowess.
More like a cesspool of delight.
What has four hooves and wants to buy a potion?
This guy.
[exclaims]
I thought being the only human in a magical world would make me special.
But apparently, it just makes everyone want to scream at me or...
[holds up her arm to reveal a small winged creature biting her elbow]
eat me.
[flings the creature away and sighs, opening her book]
At this point, Azura had already been sent on an enchanted quest.
Where's my quest-granting wizard?
This has been a rough day.
[stands and hefts the potions sack over her shoulder with a grunt; takes out a piece of paper and starts down the alley]
Let's just deliver this last package and go home.
Maybe this world isn't what I thought it wa-- [gasps]
Pretty!
[walking inside and ignoring King]
Hello?
[entering a room]
I-I'm delivering a package from Miss Eda, the Owl Lady.
Huh?
[gasps]
Today just got good.
[dancing excitedly]
Magical wizard!
Uh, I-I'm--
[gasps]
Okay.
But the stars on his robe are sparkling.
And look, there's a baby fox in his beard.
Plus, I see scones on the table.
We'd love to join you for tea.
[turns and notices a cart of potions]
Do you sell potions, Sir Wizard?
Well, I'm kinda, sorta, her apprentice.
[holds a fake grin before sighing]
Can I be honest, Mr.
Adegast?
When I decided to stay in this magical world, I thought I was meant for something special.
But Eda thinks I'm meant for chores and I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.
A quest?
Yes!
Perhaps I hath.
[takes the map]
[follows him]
So worthy.
Love peril.
Big fan of peril.
[stops walking]
Chosen one.
Yes, we have to go.
And pack for this enchanted quest!
I'm in.
So, King, what kind of Chosen One should I be?
[picks up her book]
Should I be full of optimism and goodness, like the Good Witch Azura?
Or should I be like a bad girl Chosen One with black nail polish and a mysteriously withdrawn attitude?
[uses the book as a mouth]
I act like I don't care, but I secretly do.
What?
Can I have some time alone?
Maybe they were right.
[leans against the wall before sliding down it to the floor]
Huh?
The path will only appear to the worthy.
[gasps]
That's why Eda couldn't see it.
But am...
I really worthy?
I'll never know unless I try.
[inhales]
My first mythical quest.
Okay.
Got my scroll, got my youthful optimism, got my trusty weapon.
[pulls out the sword and hits a button on it]
You know, I wonder if I made the right choice by coming here.
[gasps]
Wow!
[staring at his biceps]
Yes.
Yes, I did make the right choice.
Nevareth, your vengeful backstory is so compelling.
And I'm lovin' your animal sidekick.
Nevareth!
[turns and laughs to herself]
This quest is questing in all the right ways.
Hit me, little furry man.
Hmm.
[bends down to inspect his nametag]
Uh...
Chris?
Wow.
This is amazing.
Thank you.
[puts the ring on]
Nah, I think I'm goo--
Yes.
I need a cape.
[giggles]
Thank you for inviting me to your feast, Princess.
All your food was so tiny and cute.
[puts the bracelets on]
Thank you.
You have all been so kind and thoughtful.
[jumps and strikes a pose]
I hope this quest never ends.
[drops her pose]
Thanks for ruining the mood, Chris.
[gasps]
I knew this world wasn't all gloom and doom like Eda and King said.
[skipping and twirling down the walkway]
There is wonder here.
And I...
I think I came here for a reason.
Okay, this is it.
Moment of truth.
Yes!
I am the Chosen One!
I knew it!
I always suspected there was a reason nobody understood my wacky antics back at home.
[jumps and twirls in a circle, then holds the staff with both hands]
Now I have concrete proof.
[laughs]
What?
[whimpers]
Magical wizard?
Huh?
Okay, Luz.
Don't panic.
This is classic Chosen One biz.
You just have to rescue everybody and defeat the final boss.
What?
Betrayed by my own cool accessories.
Why are you doing this?
Does everybody have a beef with Eda here?
[sighs]
Joke's on you, 'cause Eda isn't stupid enough to fall for your trap.
Oh, heck!
It is beautiful here.
And you guys think I'm special.
But it's not real.
[grunts and waves the fog away, running forward to pick up her sword]
I am a Witch's Apprentice.
And I'm gonna earn my magic staff the hard way.
I believed you, Magic Man.
Now feel my wrath!
I thought we had a connection, Nevareth!
[plunges her sword through his chest]
King, I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you and never trusted that wizard.
You were right.
He isn't mystical or magical.
He's just a big, slimy jerk.
I'm just confused.
This place is nothing like I imagined.
[takes the blindfold off]
Whoa!
It's beautiful.
Eda, how did you know that wizard was lying?
Does that mean you'll give me a magic staff of my own?
I don't care what Belos is up to...
because today, I'm saving Eda!
This is serious, King.
Eda used her power to save me and got caught by Lilith.
Now she's the Owl Beast and is being taken before the Emperor!
I don't know what he's planning to do with Eda, but I'm going to rescue her.
King, please try to understand.
Eda is in this situation because of me.
Because of my stupid choice.
I have to make up for it.
I don't know.
But I have to try anyway.
King...
Alright.
Then we've got no time to lose!
[runs out of the room]
Please tell me that's not as bad as it sounds.
Lilith.
She cursed Eda.
She captured her own sister!
She is the worst!
If I ever see her again!
[sighs]
You're right, but how will we get to the Conformatorium in time?
Hey!
Yep.
Perfect plan.
[growls]
[screams and slams an ice glyph on the ground]
Where's Eda?
Draw me a map!
King, watch the door.
Eda?
Eda!
[pulls out an activated light glyph]
Eda, wait!
It's me!
It's me.
It's okay Eda, I'm here to save you.
But, but I can't!
It's my fault you needed to save me.
It's my fault you got captured.
Eda...
But we're a family!
Us weirdos have to stick together, remember?
[looks at Eda with tears in her eyes before tucking the key under her cloak and hugging her]
I love you, Eda.
[runs forward and grabs a hold of the bottom of Eda's claw]
Not yet!
Eda!
You.
You hurt Eda.
You put her in chains.
And now, I will take you down!
[yells as she jumps at Lilith, activating spell cards]
Talk to the glyph, witch!
[dives out of the way of Lilith's spell and pulls a fire glyph out]
Fire!
[the glyph disintegrates in her hands]
What?
No way!
You deserve to be petrified!
Not Eda!
Why did you do all this?
How do I know I can trust you?
Owlbert!
You're okay.
All right, Lilith.
I don't like your whole, [she points at Lilith and traces a circle with her finger]
deal, but...
[her expression softens]
we need your help to save Eda.
I'm coming.
Thank you, Lilith.
What will you do now?
That's good to hear.
[looks around]
Wait, why are there no guards around?
Lilith!
King!
Let my friends go, or else!
[screams]
Huh?
[smirks]
Not even close.
[moves her hand to reveal an ice glyph]
But...
my home.
[reaches for the ceiling, for Eda]
[grabs the clasp of her cloak as a tear runs down her cheek]
Fine!
[reaches under her cloak and activates the portal door, keeping the key out of sight of Belos.
She hugs the door to her chest.
Lo siento, mamá.
[grabs Eda's staff and stands, reluctantly walking towards Belos and holding out the door]
Here, it's yours.
I may have lost, but so have you.
[activates a fire glyph as she walks behind Kikimora]
Free them, now!
Eda!
Are you okay?
Don't worry, Eda.
I'll run and get you some elixir and--
Eda!
Can you still do magic?
It's okay.
I can teach you what I know, and what we don't know, we can learn together.
[voiceover]
And that's how we escaped from the Emperor.
Everyone told me he was the most powerful witch alive.
But look at this, Mom.
[holds up the chip of Belos's mask]
I chipped off a piece of his mask!
I know he's not invincible now.
[her expression falls]
It's a strange feeling, having gone through so much and, not having you here to share it with.
And I don't know when or how I'm gonna see you again.
[puts her phone down and looks at a picture of her and Camila, then at the ball of light hovering in front of her]
But I will find my way home to you.
I promise.
Deja una luz puesta para mí.
Te quiero.
