And that's the end.
My book report.
I think I knocked it out of the park.
That's where the backup snakes were.
That was for the Act Three closer.
Now for the final anatomically correct touch, spider breath.
You think that's an impressive trick?
Take a look at this.
Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Don't worry, Mom.
I won't let you down.
No more weirdness!
That doesn't count, right?
But I don't like any of that stuff.
I like editing anime clips to music and... and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories.
Yes, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Tiny trash thief!
Stop adorably hopping away, you-- Huh?
Whoa.
I thought I had a lot of weird stuff.
But this?
This is impressive.
Excuse me, sorry, it's mine, thank you.
Wah-ah!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
What's going on?
Oh, hello, little fairy.
Are you going to tell me this is all a fantastical dream?
Where am I?
Did I die?
Am I in the bad place?
I'm so sorry!
I just wanted my book!
If you're gonna eat my skin, just make it quick!
Just do it now!
That's not all it can do.
Here, let me see it.
Voila!
I'm Luz.
That's kind of a weird thing for another human to say.
A witch?
Whoa!
Witch criminal!
Aah!
Wh-What?
That's not cool!
This is crazy.
If I die here, my mom's gonna kill me!
Wait.
Flying staffs, crazy monsters, you're a witch!
What is this place?
A griffin!
I knew it!
Giraffes?
Aaah!
Well, I've had enough adventure for today.
This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about.
So, can you help me get back home?
Whoa!
Aren't you worried about those guards finding us?
This place is beautiful!
Do you live here all alone?
Ay, que lindo!
Eda, he's so cute!
Who's a widdle guy?
Who's a widdle guy?
Is it you?
Is it you?
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't like the sound of this situation.
You mean this little bundle of joy?
So I don't really have a choice, do I?
Where are we going?
Whoa.
These guys really have the hots for you.
Will I need a disguise?
I've been waiting to use this.
Meow, meow.
Whoa!
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not a cat.
Also, I'm not a criminal.
Wait.
These aren't crimes.
None of you actually did anything wrong.
You're all just a bunch of weirdos.
Like me.
Don't worry.
I can get you out.
My weak nerd arms!
It's not fair that they're all in here.
They just want to be themselves.
Why does everyone think that being a weirdo is so bad?
Wait a second.
That crown doesn't give him any powers, does it?
Eda!
Are you okay?
Does it?
What?
I hate everything you're saying right now.
Okay, we're going now.
Expecto... flying? Magicus... escapicus!
Eda, lend me a hand!
What about you guys?
Why are you guys just standing there?
This is your chance to escape!
So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things.
That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome.
Don't you see?
Because us weirdos have to stick together.
And nobody should be punished for who they are.
Now, let's get 'em!
Go, go, go, go!
Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace.
Now eat this, sucka!
Before I go... I know it's not the same, but... a king shouldn't be without a crown.
Okay.
I know you got your head cut off, and we started some kind of prison riot, but this was the most fun I've ever had.
I don't fit in at home.
You don't fit in here.
If I stay, we could not fit in together.
I'm not going back to summer camp.
I want to stay and become a witch.
Like you and Azura.
Maybe that's because they haven't tried.
If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want.
King, listen to this!
Sorry!
Now that I'll be a student at Hexside, I wanna learn all about it!
I've got a new crush, and her name is Education!
Is it your birthday!
You can have my trash.
Whoa!
Did you know that Hexside was built on the bones of its rival school?
One it literally conquered!
Can you imagine it!
Me, in the halls of Hexside, studying with Willow and Gus and- maybe even Amity!
Amity!
Oh cramity!
We're supposed to meet so I can get my Azura book back!
I love you guys!
Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity.
Gotta find that- oh!
There she is.
Hey Amity!
Luz is finally here!
So, what'd you think?
So fine you drew yourself with Malingale the Mysterious Soothsayer?
This is great!
Maybe we could even start an Azura club at school when we're classmates!
Surprise!
I'm enrolling at Hexside!
Placement exam?
Spells?
Pff.
Yeah.
'Course I know two spells!
Uh, actually, I have other training plans in a very far away place that I have to go to right now.
Bye!
Edaaaa!
Eda, Eda!
Eda!
You have to teach me a new spell right now!
But I need to know two spells to get into decent classes at Hexside.
I can make light glyphs.
But at the end of the day, that's the only spell I know.
Just teach me a spell now.
Any spell!
It can be the darkest evil.
Come on Eda!
You're the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.
How would it look if your apprentice got thrown into the baby class?
Aww, he stamped his little foot!
Yes!
Yes!
YES!
It's beautiful!
I'll definitely learn my second spell here!
Gorgeous views, magic in the air.
And best of all, we're completely alone!
Forget teaching me a spell, just make me disappear.
Okay, let's do this.
Hey guys!
Be cool!
If they know I haven't mastered two spells, they'll think I belong in the baby class!
Amity!
Wha... What are you doing here?
Yup!
Powerful spells!
I'm workin' on one that's so crazy!
Eda's a pretty incredible teacher.
Eda!
Can you please take this seriously?
Okay.
I trust you.
Ugh.
Okay.
I've identified the smells of three different rocks, sorted all the twigs from big to small, and found your glove, and your hand.
So what now?
With all my heart.
Alright, Luz.
Look.
Look with everything you've got.
Focus.
Don't think like that!
Silence, hands!
If I wanna be in the same class as Amity, I'm gonna need to learn magic like Amity.
Shh!
I don't need your validation.
Huh.
Her crosshatching has improved.
Oh man, oh man.
Yes!
I did magic!
I did magic!
Without drawing anything!
This thing is the coolest!
I'm doing magic, what would you have me do?
Eat more snow?
Lick a rock?
Well, it's already helped me.
Just watch what I can do!
Wh... whoaaa!
Will it accept a heartfelt apology?
Eda!
Um... I... I didn't know!
But I don't actually... know any.
What do we do?
But the beast has Eda!
Amity!
Wait!
Stupid island.
Ugh!
You were supposed to teach me magic.
But I'll never learn more than this.
Wait.
Is that... a light glyph?
But what does that mean?
Whoa.
It means... magic is a gift from the island.
It means... magic is everywhere!
Magic is everywhere!
My second spell!
Thank you, snow!
Thank you, island!
Thank you, Eda.
Eda!
I have to save her.
That's right. Death is here. Just kidding, Luz is here!
Don't worry, Eda, I get it now.
I was so obsessed with learning my second spell, I didn't listen to you.
But now I'm gonna save you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, forget that, because you and I are gonna have to work together if we want to save everyone.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
Hey! You big idiot! Over here!
Gotcha!
Now that's my mentor!
Did you see?
I learned my second spell, I made the connection!
Azura Book Club?
Azura Book Club!
On it, teach!
Ooh, magic 'sghetti.
I'm worth salt...
I want cloak!
I think I finally understand why the Emperor wants you so badly.
He's got the hots for you, doesn't he?
And he won't stop until he's got you...
King! Get the elixir!
Now!
Hey, your gem!
It's still dark!
The curse has been getting worse and you've been hiding it!
What happens if you use your magic up?
Do you... do you die?
No, I-I can't let that happen!
I'll do something about it.
Get rest!
Drink lots of water!
Stay out of the sun!
Poor Eda.
Enemies everywhere, even her own body.
I wish I could help her.
Right.
I was actually gonna stay behind.
I don't like the way they treat Eda.
Like what?
Mmm... The Healing Hat.
Made from the magic of the Savage Ages.
It is said to cure the deadliest diseases... and heal any curse?
Mmm.
You've done so much for me, Eda.
Now I'm gonna do something for you.
Um, what was that, Willow?
So, Willow... would you say this Belos guy is like, powerful?
Heh... uh, love me a properly ventilated castle!
Hmm.
Please don't notice I'm gone, please don't notice I'm... boarding the bus?
Huh?
Wah!
Guys.
You got me.
But you don't understand.
Thanks, guys.
I know exactly what we gotta do.
It's time for a heist!
Healing Hat.
You're Eda's last hope.
I can feel it!
I can feel the magic flowing!
Now we can cure Eda and get this hat back before anyone knows it's gone.
We need to go. Now.
Come on, let's go!
Stay away!
I needed that to heal your sister!
Eda!
Eda!
Your gem!
Eda, stop!
Your magic!
Eda, stop!
You'll run out of magic!
Eda, no, no, no!
Please, no!
Eda.
You monster!
Hi, Hooty.
I drew a flip book.
Pew, pew, pew!
What?
Wait.
I thought you were the King of Demons.
Are you just making this up now?
Well, I can offer you more of this tantalizing book.
Um, Eda?
What customers?
There aren't even any other stands around.
What's going on?
Gus, Willow!
Hey!
A job fair for witches!
Eda, can we go?
Who's we?
You have a mysterious past!
Now we gotta go!
Okay.
Then you leave me no choice.
Is this cowl really necessary?
Whoa.
Was I even alive before now?
Ooh, what's that?
Yowza-wowza!
Yowza-wha-a-a?
Wow!
Acceptance? Comradery? A sense of belonging?
Covens sound incredible!
Eda, why haven't you ever joined one?
That panel looks popular.
Aren't you coming, Eda?
I get it, Eda.
Covens: bad. Individualism: good.
But I'm still figuring this world out, so I'm going to go in there and make up my own mind, okay?
Whoa.
Hmm?
You know her?
Eda!
Where are you going?
But we haven't even taken the quiz to determine our coven type!
Ooh, a punky potionist.
Uh... hey, Amity.
So, funny story.
Not an abomination.
Sorry for the confusion last week.
I-I'm Luz. The human.
Well, to be fair, you were okay with him trying to dissect me, so...
Well, I'm learning how to be a witch.
I'm receiving magic lessons from a powerful witch and a ferocious demon.
Why are you being so mean, Amity?
He's a very good boy and the King of Demons!
I'll tell you what, Amity.
It's one thing to say I can't be a witch... but it's another thing to bully my friends.
Just like The Good Witch Azura said when facing down her rival Hecate at the Bog of Immediate Regret... I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!
One, if I win, you apologize to King for squashing his cupcake.
And two, you admit that humans can be witches too.
Fine.
Let's shake on it.
That's probably fine.
King, I-I can win this, right?
Eda, I need your help!
I accidentally challenged Amity to a witch's duel, and I think she's going to kill me all the way dead!
But... whose blood?
I-Is there a glowy hand thing that happens, or, uh...
I can't believe I'm gonna have to stop learning magic!
Eda?
What am I going to do?
That's cheating!
But I will know in my heart!
Even if I win now, I lose.
I'm not good under pressure!
Whoa!
No, Amity, don't step any closer!
It wasn't my idea to cheat.
And when I found out, I tried to stop it, but...
Amity, wait!
You'll get more offerings, King.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Yeah, but... I'm not a witch.
But I'm training hard to be one.
It doesn't come naturally to me like it does for you, so I've had to improvise.
Did it work?
Can I still learn magic?
Yeah, sorry.
Your legs are just so tiny.
Should we get you more offerings?
Is it love?
How'd you get away from Lilith?
Eda... Do you think I'll ever be a true witch?
My own witch.
Sister?
Now that's a mysterious past payoff!
What?
You've got parents?
I need to know more!
Come on!
Work this time.
Check it out, King: my glyph skills are blossoming!
I see we're getting enough Wi-Fi through the portal for cat videos.
I regret teaching you about the Internet.
Yep, that's not right.
Good enough.
Ugh!
What am I supposed to say?
Hey mom, not at camp actually!
I'm in the demon realm learning to be a witch!
Also, did you know that demons and magic are real?
She will end me.
The demon on my shoulder makes a good point.
Hehe.
Don't spend all day watching MewTube, 'kay?
Something's different today.
Did everyone get a haircut?
You guys have a version of prom on the Boiling Isles?
I was kicked out of my last school dance for dressing like an otter, but here, I can be your Grom queen!
No problem, let me help you!
Here, your note.
Man, you got some quick grabbers.
WHOOOO!
Amity, get it, queen!
Don't leave me hangin'!
My first school dance experience on the Boiling Isles.
I can't wait to get overdressed, take awkward photos, push all the buttons... wait, what?
Well, hello.
Don't mind if I do.
Woah!
Medieval torture seems like a strange theme for Grom, but hey...
Right.
Why don't you seem excited?
If it worries you so much, then why don't you tell Principal Bump you want out of this death match biz?
Unless talking to Bump is your greatest fear.
I'm home!
Guys?
Hey, sweet duds, Owl Lady!
What's the haps?
Yeah.
It's Amity.
She's kinda freaking out though.
I wish I could, like, take her place or something.
Hey!
I've been learning lots of new spells!
I could totally handle it.
Nope.
I'm not as fragile as you think, Eda.
And I can't be so easily fooled, either.
Eda doesn't know me!
I-I'm brave!
I'm a bad boy!
Ominous footsteps, creepy woods.
This is no problem.
Oh my gosh, Amity!
I'm so sorry!
Did you talk to Bump?
Was it as terrifying as you imagined?
Amity Blight, I'll do it.
I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena.
I'll be your fearless champion!
Hooty!
No touching!
Amity!
Which should I wear to Grom?
This one says, witch with a dark side.
But this one says, I'm an otter... with a dark side.
Stop, stop!
In preparation, I've made a list!
Jerks online who wanna debate!
Human souls trapped in cat bodies!
I'm lactose intolerant!
My real fear... is that Eda thinks I'm too fragile to do this!
And if she's right, I'll never be a real witch!
Nooooo!
So what if I am!
Well, maybe you'll have fun watching me defeat Grom!
I'll take it!
I'm not sure if it's nerves or if I accidentally drank some milk, but something's making my stomach squirm.
Yeah right!
You goin' soft on me, Blight?
Wish me luck!
There you are, Gromarama.
Not too scary.
Ugh, so weird.
You're not coming from a place of intellectual honesty, so debating you would be pointless!
Let's finish this!
What are you doing here?
I can explain!
I can't do it!
I can't face my fear!
I don't wanna be Grom queen anymore!
I give up the throne!
You're not really my mom!
Eda!
You're right!
I'm not ready!
Amity!
No, your fear!
Who is that?
You were afraid of getting rejected.
Amity, it's okay.
What if I went to Grom with you instead?
That's what friends do.
Sooooooo.... who did you wanna ask out?
Thanks, but... I'm gonna go to bed.
In the end, I couldn't face my mom.
Maybe I am fragile.
Hmm.
I won't lie.
Today was kinda hard.
And I don't always feel like I'm supposed to be here.
But when things get tough, my friends help me out.
I think you'd like them.
Te extraño también, Mami.
One day, I'll tell you all about this.
That's a cute way of saying text.
Oh boy, cards!
The paper rectangles that old people think are fun!
Uh, Eda?
It's happening again!
Uh, last time this happened, you turned into this thing.
Eda!
Take these and fly ahead.
She'll have to follow us.
Is there anything better than people watching in the Demon Realm?
The curse of tiny legs.
Whoa, that is one ominous parade.
Heya, friends!
Wait, what's wrong?
Who hurt my babies?
It's conjuring night!
No dorks allowed?
What a jerk!
What's a moonlight conjuring?
Like a slumber party!
We have those!
Like a weird slumber party!
I'm three people... I mean, we're three people, and we're way better than them!
Don't waste your time getting thorny over them.
'Cause we're gonna have our own moonlight conjuring.
That's a really weird thing to want, but I appreciate your enthusiasm.
I'll go tell Eda.
Eda, Gus and Willow and I are gonna do a moonlight conjuring and stick it to Amity.
She said yes.
We can do it at the Owl House.
As long as we don't make a mess or touch anything and never bring up that we did it!
You can count on me... I'd never betray your hard-earned trust.
Oh, where's King?
Aww, he's so dangly.
Should I really be doing this?
No, no, Willow is counting on you.
Okay, she's gone.
Welcome to, the living room.
We call it that because it's technically living!
The walls are breathing, look.
We've got snacks, we've got weird music!
Gus, my man.
So how does this conjuring stuff work?
Yes!
He's perfect!
Yes!
Moonlight tie... string... and I don't know the words!
Did the entire house just hiccup?
The house?
Hooty?
Hooty!
Hooty, you have to stop!
Hooty, stop!
Willow, Gus, hold hands again.
On the one hand, we should probably stay put.
Okay, okay, but we gotta be back before the moon sets or Eda will kill me.
You should, uh, stop being so mean to people.
You're kind of a jerk.
But don't you see?
I am no mere house.
Actually, I'm starting to think we should head back.
Shout out to my fellow witches.
Let's do it.
Is that a... giant crossbow?
Hooty!
Hooty!
You have to wake up!
Oye, no me hable así!
Willow, will you help me out with Hooty?
Did the house stop moving?
Hooty would taste terrible.
If we're not killed now, we will be when Eda finds out about the house.
That's ridiculous.
You helped bring a house to life.
Amity doesn't know what she's talking about.
Next to Eda, you're the most powerful witch I know.
No offense, Gus.
Everyone, quick!
Oh, no.
I don't mean to step on this victory but we gotta get home before Eda does.
Sorry, mister.
Did we do it?
Sorry about all that, Hooty.
Oh, boy.
Oh, man.
Hey, you didn't have to do that.
You know, I still kinda wish we got to show up Amity.
I don't like this.
Please don't make me.
So, Eda... what if we tried some new lessons for my apprenticeship?
Like... read ancient scrolls or mix together potions, or... wait.
Is there a magic school here?
Like, winding towers, cute uniforms, dark plots that threaten your life kind of magic school?
Actually, if it's okay, I think I'll head home and look at pictures of animals that are still... alive.
Love you, King.
You little beach peach.
If magic's all about digging for slime balls, maybe I don't have the stomach for it.
It's okay.
The thorns only went through a few layers of skin.
What you did with that flower and those plants, it was... wow.
Like, magic school?
That's so cool!
I'm so jealous.
I have a teacher, but her lessons are a bit... untraditional.
I bet she wouldn't even let me enroll.
But I wish I could spend one day there.
Hey, wait.
I know how we can both get what we want.
Make me your abomination.
I'll get you a good grade, and you can get me into magic school.
It's fiendishly clever.
I saw that girl's thing.
It's just chunks of stuff that talks weird.
I'm chunks of stuff, and I talk weird!
This is a great plan.
Great plan.
Actually, it's for storing treats.
I'm an abomination.
I knew an Augustus back in the human world.
We called him Gus.
Don't listen to them, Willow.
We can do this.
Uh, I may be your abomination, but you're my a-mom-ination.
Oh my gosh I haven't eaten real food in so long please give me some.
I'm a sweaty little abomination.
But now we don't have to worry about Amity.
High five!
Slap my hand.
It's a human thing.
Uh, viral fame is a worthy pursuit.
Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance.
This is all my fault, Willow.
I just wanted to see what a real magic school was like.
It's lovely, actually.
And you're great.
And someone once told me great witches are resourceful.
You mean that greasy slime ball?
Thank goodness someone told me to hold on to it.
There's the exit!
Whoa!
I'm not leaving you.
I can't save you right now.
But I know someone who can!
Eda!
Your lesson worked!
Keeping junk in my pocket saved my life!
My new friends. They're in danger.
It's true.
I don't believe it.
Yes!
Whoo!
What about Amity?
Well, I can't wait to see you in action next time I sneak in.
But... I have a pretty great teacher already.
Azura is able to befriend everyone.
Even her biggest rival.
I wish I had that kind of power.
Eda, you got a package.
It looks like a gift basket.
No, not eating that.
Who's the Bat Queen?
Our greatest adventure yet!
Learning about love and life through a child's eyes.
Well, I better get to the library!
Got to go!
Bye!
Huh?
Whoa.
Whoa!
Huh?
Huh.
That was a crazy night.
Ooh.
What's that?
I am in a library.
I will read a book.
Wow!
Sorry!
This place is amazing.
I've been caught. Pretend to be a book.
Amity reading to kids?
Amity seems so... nice and smiley.
Maybe I can befriend her like Azura befriended her rival.
Wow.
Looks like this sour lemon drop has a hidden sweet center.
Hey, I could help with the kids.
We could take turns reading.
I do the best monster voice.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So much for befriending rivals.
Who are you?
I know.
But I didn't mean any of it.
I thought we were as cool as cucumbers.
But we're as sour as pickles.
Whoo!
Amity's even madder at me now.
I didn't think that was possible.
This is great.
First I befriend the siblings then I befriend the Amity.
I just had the best day.
Cool teens like me.
Call me a library book 'cause they were checking me out.
Aw, Eda, you look so motherly.
How can you say that around this cute little baby?
Whoa!
Parenting sure looks rewarding.
E-Enjoy your life lessons.
Bye.
Gotta be cool.
Cool? Cool.
Huh?
Mm-hmm-mm-hmm.
Wow!
Standing in a dimly lit lobby.
You guys know how to party.
Whoa.
Wait.
The books are all glowy.
Nothing happened.
Cute little quackster.
I don't know.
I can't do it.
I don't wanna see it.
Oh, wow.
Boiling Isles romance.
That's totally lame.
I mean, unless you guys are into it?
Wow!
That's a good book.
Your clubhouse is like my ultimate secret hideaway.
What?
Isn't that taking it a bit too far?
Hmm.
Well, I... I don't see any diaries in here.
Nope, nothin'.
Let's just leave.
Wait, are those... Good Witch Azura books one through four!
You get these on the Boiling Isles?
So majestic.
Is this cover hand-drawn?
Just a Good Witch Azura 5 where she goes through her Goth phase.
Huh?
No, wait.
I know Amity can be kind of cold but no one deserves this.
These are private thoughts.
Let's put it back.
It's not what it looks like.
You're just gonna leave?
But I need to go talk to Mittens.
Amity, wait.
Please, just listen to me.
Huh?
Amity!
Amity.
Huh?
Is a drawn okay?
I kind of interpreted the descriptions.
Ah, right.
Let go of her.
Not an Azura fan, are you?
You fiend.
You can't rhyme friends with friends.
I was trying to save you.
No, we aren't.
Follow my lead.
I don't know.
I didn't even think that would work.
I was all like roaaar.
Third dimension how I've missed you.
What an adventure.
Thanks for helping clean up.
It doesn't make up for reading your diary but would you wanna borrow this?
I noticed you only had up to four.
Hi, guys.
I'm... home.
Hooty.
Whoa.
You must be Mama.
Your night looks very successful.
Look at all that money you made.
And look at this cool whistle that scary woman gave you.
I'd wash it before you use it.
I actually got you something from the library.
Good. Then bad. Then maybe good?
Ugh.
It's been a little slow around here, but I've got just the thing to attract customers.
And who doesn't like their name in lights?
Is it too subtle?
Hi, Boscha!
Hexsidians!
See anything you like?
It's not funny, Boscha.
Even if I could, it's not worth it.
You wouldn't understand how to handle teens like her.
Yeah, teens can be sour, but I'm a little sweetie.
Look what I made you!
Did I spell something wrong?
Or did I spell something right?
Well, I don't see anyone right now.
Maybe you're just being paranoid.
You're a powerful witch.
Why hide when you can poof all your problems away with magic?
Then why are you screaming like one?
Hug each other till we pass out?
We're doing that?
That's possible?
This is just like my favorite early 2000s movie!
Freaky Fraturday.
But maybe we should think about this for a second.
Ooh!
Did it work?
I need a mirror.
Found one.
Oh, my gosh.
It worked!
I'm so old... and pointy!
Hot dog!
It's me!
Well, I've got magic.
Eda, don't be too mad when your inventory's gone and the guards are none the wiser.
Whew!
Okay, let's try this again.
And strut, strut, strut.
How does Eda wear these all day?
Oh, no.
What have my heels done?
Wait a second.
I'm a ding dang witch!
Boy, Eda is powerful.
Not again!
Okay, let's try this one more time.
I made magic with my hands!
Zippo swappo.
Sold to the savvy shopper.
Okay, magic hands, let's see what else we can magically magic.
Step right up and feast your eyes on the marvels of the human realm!
Was it for laughter?
Thank you!
Come again!
There's a little something for everyone.
Take it from me, Eda, the Boiling Isles' gift to magic.
That depends.
Are you a fan... of magic?
Gentlemen, whaddya say we forget this whole thing ever happened?
Amnesia spell!
Haven't quite got the hang of this yet.
Owlbert!
This is all a big mistake.
You're gonna laugh when I explain.
Look, guys, you got the wrong Eda.
Oh, thank goodness!
A familiar face.
You're Eda's sister, right?
Is it Libby?
Well, as I was telling the guard, this is just a classic Freaky Fraturday mix-up.
Yeah, I think that list goes on for a while.
I know.
I can't just poof my problems away.
Eda wanted to be in the Emperor's Coven?
The what now?
Wait, you're making a mistake!
I'm not a danger to anyone!
Uh-oh.
Owlbert, come to me!
Huh?
Sorry, buddy.
Eda's life is more complicated than I thought.
Okay, if I were Eda and Eda is King, where would I be?
This thing's so confusing.
Eda!
Go, go, go!
What weird stuff did you get my body into?
Sorry.
Eda, I just wanna say that things can be more complicated than you think.
But with you guys, it all feels a little less mixed up.
So, wait.
Who is going to clean Hooty?
It's getting... dire.
Aw, man.
So they said I couldn't remove my thumb, but look at that!
Whoop!
And they say humans can't do magic.
Heyo, dough boy, quit loafing around!
School time!
See you guys in class!
Hey, don't worry.
We'll finish our comedy hour when we get home.
Try not to miss me while I'm gone!
Apparently there's an infestation of pixies at Hexside, so school's been canceled.
You know, I've been so busy with school lately, what do you say we take this comedy hour on tour?
It'll be a Luz and King day!
Let's all three of us go!
And smell all the fresh meat!
Aren't you mad at us for destroying your stand?
It's like a regular circus but adorably small!
You're my friends now.
You know what, Eda can pick through my socks all she wants.
Because today is all about having a great time with my partner in crime.
Now this is my kind of weird!
So what do you wanna do first?
We could brave the molar coaster, or eat a mysterious blob...
No, silly.
That's a friendship bracelet.
A weapon of love.
It's basically a declaration to the whole world that you're the best of friends.
Or let's just play the games.
Yes!
This mama is ready for trauma.
Oh, yeah.
We're on a very important quest to win a special prize for King.
What do you think, King?
The more the merrier, huh?
All right.
Approval!
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
King!
Sorry we lost you back there, little dude.
Food!
I'm gonna crab some rotten candy while you guys figure this out.
Bye!
Wow.
I guess they really wanted to ride those bumper carcasses.
There's something I gotta tell you, King.
I said I'd help you win those friendship bracelets.
So win them we shall, okay?
What was that?
Ready or not, here we crumb.
Now, King, before you spend your tickets are you sure you want those friendship bracelets and not this bad boy?
This guy's a riot.
Ugh, gross.
I'm gonna need a mirror.
I'll be right back, King.
There we go.
You made it.
What a supportive sign.
Wait a sec.
Supportive friends!
Huh?
Oh, my gosh.
King... What?
That must've been what did it.
Give me the spray bottle, King.
There's nothing to explain.
Shrink my friends?
Why are you doing this?
At least he's still my friend.
That's how friends react.
We've gotta find a way out of here!
King?
You shrunk the animals too?
All thanks to you, King.
Here.
It was all that was left.
That's very sweet.
And can I tell you a secret?
I've been missing you too.
You read my mind.
You coming, Eda?
Gus, I'd love to go to school with you, but I don't know how I can.
Principal Bump banned me from Hexside.
Well, I would love to go some day.
Better than unpacking boxes in the Eda Coven.
I don't care about T-shirts, Eda!
I want to learn magic and they teach that at Hexside!
Oh my gosh.
Yes, yes, yes!
Of course I'll be there tomorrow!
Gus, this will be great!
I get to see the school and save the president.
Undercover from what?
Whoa.
I love it.
On the Boiling Isles, new things smell old.
Oh, a showman.
I totally get it.
You bring the razzle, I'll bring the dazzle.
Bye, friend.
Be safe.
Make good choices.
That's new.
Ta-da!
Yeah.
I've been doing this for years.
Wow!
Who got the trophy for the most bones?
Whoa!
Okay.
But next time you have to give me a full tour.
Ooh.
It's the abomination professor.
I should introduce myself.
Apologize for the incident.
Hey, Mr Abomination Professor.
Remember me?
Ooh.
What's in here?
Wait, if you're here, who is that?
You're good.
Of course, Mr President.
Allow me to determine if they're truly of my realm's origin.
Hey, man.
It's okay.
You're only human.
Well, you know what I mean.
We've all been the new kid before.
Right, Gus?
No, it's fine.
The ban's been lifted.
Tell 'em, Gus.
Tell them!
Help!
I don't even learn here!
Where are you taking me?
That won't be so bad, right?
You said the ban was lifted!
How is this detention?
This is a death sentence!
That isn't hard to believe.
You're kind of a jerk.
You lied to me.
You lied about the ban!
Yes, you did!
I get it.
I just wish you told me the truth.
I'm in.
Where do we start?
You know, it didn't taste as bad as I thought it would.
Oh, you're a witch.
Do magic.
Oh, gosh.
He's so little.
This is part of the plan, right?
A genius and a wordsmith.
Right behind you.
Eda?
What?
Yeah!
Let's go.
Wow!
Bump was not exaggerating.
You were a terrible student.
I-I'm not ready for this Eda.
Maybe we should go back.
But what if... What if I mess something up?
Or what if I do something wrong?
What if I die?
Eda!
Pumped!
Ready!
From the humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise.
I have traveled from another realm and trained with a powerful witch to master dark and forbidden magic.
I am... Luz Noceda!
I sure can.
It's said that humans can't do magic, but I discovered a lost technique that changes everything.
Uhh... Um, I can do other things, what about... this?
Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Ow ow!
Eyelash!
Eyelash!
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Whoops!
I failed, didn't I?
Hurray.
Mmm, we gotta go back.
This was a mistake!
I'm gonna mess things up again and everyone will see, and... that's why I'm nervous!
At my human school, I didn't make a good first impression.
This is a chance to be seen as something other than a screw-up.
Aw, I won't be doing that.
But thanks.
Nah, I'll just earn it when I quit showering.
Bye!
Thanks, Eda.
In fact, I have written a heartfelt sonnet to commemorate this occasion.
Up top!
Blegh!
Wow, my first day at Hexside.
A chance to discover my true magical potential.
And maybe meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman.
King?
Why are you in my bag?
Okay, but if anyone asks, you don't know me.
Hello, fellow Hexoleos!
Hmm, that's what I'm gonna figure out right now.
See you on the other side, friends.
Hiya, Princy-B!
Can I call you that?
Actually, Principal Bump, I've made my own schedule.
Then I'll be the first.
But all the tracks are so cool!
Is there some sort of enchanted article of clothing that could sort this out for me?
I don't know if I can choose just one.
Oh, I guess I have always liked pouring things into other things.
See, potions are fun!
You could spend the rest of your life studying this, right?
Wow!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Ooh boy!
Stirring is the pits.
What else is on the schedule for today?
Oh, man!
I'm sorry, elbow!
A crystal ball.
Maybe it can show me if I'm on the right track.
No, don't be tempted!
It's your first day.
Make a good impression.
Whoa!
Wow!
Wait, what'd you say?
But I wasn't studying other subjects!
I uh... fog brew!
Yeah.
I figured that wouldn't work.
King!
Vouch for my character!
What is this place?
Nooooo!
Detention track?
But I'll be back in the human world by then.
Hello, fellow detentioners.
Room for one more?
I like the little spikeys in your hair.
Hey, don't blame any of them.
I'm the one that started talking.
Aw, farts.
I do.
Oh, my gosh!
I missed you so much.
Let me squeeze your faces.
Principal Bump put me in the detention track for mixing magic.
No, I'm better than this.
Please, you gotta help me break out.
Aw, you guys.
It's the teacher.
Gotta go!
It's you!
Whoa.
What is this place?
I'm terrified!
Um, I mean... I'm Luz.
Whoa.
Aah!
I love secret rooms!
Where do the doors go?
This place is amazing.
I bet you guys can get into so much trouble in here.
You actually like school?
Sounds like Bump's priorities are out of whack.
Eh, they're probably looking for some other Luz.
No, no, it's not like that.
I just didn't think I deserved... I mean, none of us deserve...
I understand.
Hey, guys.
Yeah.
That's right where I belong.
I know, but what's the point if people get hurt on the way?
Eat this!
I'll get you guys somewhere safe!
Guys!
I need your help!
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, but please listen!
Argh!
Something horrible is loose in the school.
It must've attacked the other schools, and now it's come for us.
We have to do something.
Hexoleos are out there gettin' hurt, and we're the only ones who can save them.
We're troublemakers, right?
So let's go out there and make some trouble.
From humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise.
I've trained with a secret society to discover the power of mixing magic!
Do the thing, do the thing!
Wooh!
He's reading your palm, and your future looks bleak.
You did it!
You were amazing!
Yeah it is.
But let's think about this, Principal Bump.
Why would kids in the detention track need a secret hideout?
Okay, you need coven money.
But if you have to hurt your students to get it, what's the point?
They saved Hexside.
They should be allowed to study what they wish.
Oh, I still can't choose.
Maybe it's crazy but I wish I could study a little bit of everything.
Whoa.
What's going on?
What is this?
Whoa-ho!
This is so cool.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna study everything!
I shoulda guessed.
And here we have the most fearsome creature in the world, the King of Demons.
Facing his natural enemy, the ducky sock!
So, why'd you call me here again?
And cute little paws.
Oh, you guys are sensitive.
Bad boy!
No, no.
I am so paying attention.
This is my paying attention face.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I love the rain.
I always love feeling the first few drops in my hair.
I bet you do too, little buddy.
What?
Huh?
Yep.
Oh, my gosh, I love you so much.
A boiling rainstorm on the Boiling Isles.
The weather here is so fun.
Wow!
Someday I'd like to be as cool as Eda the Owl Lady.
Magical, sassy, surprisingly foxy for her age.
Hey, why do they call you the Owl Lady, anyway?
You have a nest?
I want a nest!
Nest party!
This is perfect.
Since we'll be stuck in the house all night, Eda won't have any excuse not to teach me a spell.
Oh, uh, sorry, King.
But... magic.
Oh, Eda, have I told you how rad your fang looks today?
Uh, and your hair is like... girl.
Please, Eda, please.
How am I supposed to earn my witch's staff if I don't know any spells?
Oh, this?
Nope.
Teach me one spell, and I'll give you your sparkle thing.
Gimme!
Be quiet.
I need to focus.
Uh, from the heart?
Oh, gross.
Can I keep that?
But how can I, little ol' Luz, do spells if I don't have a magic bile... sac?
What?
Eda!
That's it?
Wait!
I need to see you do the circle thingy again.
I'll record it on my phone this time.
Smile!
You're on camera.
One more spell won't kill you.
Oh, my gosh.
My obsession with spells knocked out Eda.
I'm a monster.
We should get help, right?
But what if Eda's dead?
Well, we can't just leave her on the floor.
Sorry for pushing you, Miss Eda.
Please don't hurt me when you wake up.
Just let her rest, you little goober.
Come on.
Let's go downstairs.
This is all she does.
Why you gotta be so cryptic, Owl Lady?
Not now, King.
I want to figure out this spell.
But if I don't have a magic sac, what's the point?
I'll just be twirling my fingers around un-magically forever.
I was a nobody back home.
But becoming a witch is my chance to be someone.
Do you know what it's like to have no one take you seriously?
Oh, yes, yes.
You can teach me about demons all week if you help me learn this spell.
Really?
Thank you so much.
You're a prince.
Right.
Wow.
I can't believe I'm about to learn magic.
This is historic.
This is awful.
Hooty!
Hooty!
Are you in there?
Whatever did this escaped into the rain.
What could survive that?
This is terrifying.
So why do you look so happy?
You want to go toward those creepy sounds?
No way!
Oh, my gosh.
Eda!
Eda?
Slash marks.
King!
You're the demon expert.
I need your help.
King!
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
I was checking on Eda, and she was gone, and then you were gone.
I also tripped and lost my shoe.
Oh, hey, you found it.
Wait, what are you trying to say?
Eda?
Oh, man.
Did you see her eyes?
What happened to her?
Well... let's finish the lesson.
Eda's turned into some kind of demon, and we need to save her.
So who knows more about demons than the best teacher in the world?
I can't.
My camera's all blasted.
You saw me.
I can't draw circles in the air.
I'm not like Eda.
There's a pattern in the spell circle.
It looks like this.
There.
It's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh.
I just did magic.
I just did magic!
I just did magic!
I think I know how to get Eda back.
Will you help me, boo-boo buddy?
I'm sorry, Eda.
But it's for your own good.
Whoa.
So are you okay?
I had some encouragement from a great teacher.
We'll take care of him.
You stay in bed.
Come on, you goopy fella.
We'll set you free now.
Welcome to the boo-boo buddy club, Hooty.
Prepare thyself to do battle like a human!
Oh my gosh, Willow, I'm so excited for photo class!
I can't believe you can make pictures of your actual memories!
Don't eat that.
Whoa!
That could be anyone!
Alright memory melon, let's pick another juicy one!
Ooo, who says brain surgery is hard?
All the colors of the brainbow.
Whoa.
Photo class is intense.
Oh my gosh, Willow, you had an awkward hair phase, too?
I knew we were meant to be friends.
Ooo there's more!
Hey, I know you and Amity have a history.
Wouldn't you feel better talking about it?
If you won't tell me what she did, I'll never be able to cook up a scheme to make you friends again.
She never did mention anything about... shenanigans.
Wait up!
Hey there, detective.
Are you solving a crime or about to commit one?
Okay buddy, okay.
So, Willow... whoa.
Are you okay?
Gus, it really seems like she's forgotten us, like her memory is... like her memory is gone!
You destroyed Willow's memories?
Yup.
When the night critters allow me to.
Is there anything we can do?
Be still my fantasy loving heart, I have always wanted to do this!
Thank you, Boiling Isles.
Gus... has a lot on his plate.
Amity, you have to go with me.
You set everything in there on fire!
You have to help.
Whoa.
I don't know.
We'll just have to start fixing stuff on our own!
Hmm, now let's see...
Hey, I found something magical.
I'ma put my face in it!
I think I found the memories.
Let's go!
Woo!
And welcome to Willow's beautiful... memory?
Can words get any cuter?
Wha?
It's like dog house for angels!
I think fixing the fort fixed the memory!
I know, but now she's more like a great bloomer!
This place is like theater showing her most important moments!
Now let's fix some more!
The photo that started it all!
Let's do it next.
Hmm, don't mind if I do!
We don't need to see how this one ends...
Ew... I mean, aw!
Hey, you okay?
Don't worry.
We've gotten really good at fixing memories!
I won't rest until we've got this all sorted out.
Repeat after me... We can fix this together!
Come on!
Heck yeah we can!
I know some of these memories must be painful for you, but, what happened to you guys?
And why are you trying to hide it?
Look, if you don't wanna talk about it, just say so.
If you need me, I shall be fixing this memory of a ball pit.
It's full of eggs!
Why is this memory full of eggs?
Yeah.
And there's only one last memory to fix!
The one you're suspiciously avoiding.
Amity, you gotta stop being weird.
We have to fix all of them.
Unless... there's something in there you don't want me to see.
Look, I'm not here to judge, I'm just here to help Willow.
Look!
Oh no!
That thing is burning up all the memories!
Yeah... she's not super reliable.
I don't know.
That one hasn’t been burned, or that one!
Amity, that thing isn't after any photo.
It's after you!
Run!
I have an idea!
Just trust me!
Time for a swimming lesson!
Woo!
Teamwork baby!
Please!
Stop!
You're saying it all creepy, but I like the sound of... whoa!
Where are we?
Then, if it's okay, Amity and I still have some work to do.
So, does this mean you and Willow are buddies again?
Well, why don't we go see?
Whoa.
What went down here?
Where's Gus?
What did you do with Gus?
Those are very mixed messages.
Do you know who I am?
She's back, folks!
My girl's back!
I'm gonna hug you so hard you'll never forget me again!
You said nothing about shenanigans...
My first Grudgby season!
I’m so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!
You mean glory days?
Cheating isn’t anything to brag about.
How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?
Well, can’t reason with crazy.
Bye King, you little snoozers.
I can’t wait for Grudgby season to start!
I’ve studied up on all sorts of magical sports.
Like this.
A classic underdog tale.
Not food.
What’s going on?
It’s like all of Hexside’s caught Willow fever!
Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute.
But give that back!
We are having zero fun, I swear.
Boscha’s picking on us.
Don’t worry, it’s not like she can follow us around all day, right?
She followed us around all day.
She literally followed us around all day!
We will find a way out of this.
Amity!
Amity, we need your help.
Boscha won’t stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because she’s the “Star Captain of the Grudgby Team.
You’re friends with her, can you help us?
Hmm.
Okay, okay.
I’m pickin' up what you’re puttin' down.
Willow!
What happened?
That’s it!
Boscha!
Willow challenges you to... a grudgby match!
I’m just following Amity’s advice.
Boscha only speaks in Grudgby terms.
Trust me, I have a plan.
That’s right!
We’ll settle this once and for all on the field.
If Willow’s team wins, you don’t get to pick on her anymore.
That’s not even a punishment.
I love water.
But you’re the better witch.
I don’t know much about sports, but I know about sports movies.
We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy.
With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win.
What about you, Amity?
Huh?
Well, I guess she’s out.
In any case, let’s get training!
So, how exactly do we play Grudgby?
That sounds easy.
Oh, right.
Should have predicted this.
Alright!
Every great sports story includes a training montage.
What happens in the montage stays in the montage!
Now let’s hit the field.
Now for our big finale!
Let’s try... the Thorn Vault.
Guys, let’s try the Thorn Vault one more time.
But we’re the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and
Willow, wait!
I pushed Willow and Gus too hard.
It’s just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on.
She’s one of the best friends I’ve ever had.
Winning this game is the only way I know how to help.
Really?
You watched it too?
Wah!
Sorry.
I just really love backstories.
I know what to do to make this up to Willow.
Thanks.
I’m here on her behalf.
We forfeit.
And I’m here to tell you that I’ll take Willow’s place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need.
Willow!
Willow, I’m sorry I got you into this mess.
You’re right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.
Nice work.
Whoa.
Fire magic!
Amity!
Here’s what I have to offer.
The Thorn Vault?
Are you sure?
Amity!
Whoo!
You did it, Willow!
We did it!
We Won!
Wait, what?
Wh- What happened?
The what?
That just invalidates all our efforts!
If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else?
There’s no reason to watch any of the other players!
That’s such a stupid rule!
Are you sure?
I could help carry you if it really hurts.
Yeah!
Stop adorably hopping away, you... Huh?
It wasn't a dream!
Good morning, terrifying fantasy world.
Ughhh.
Good morning, you little cutie-pie.
Yes, you are.
Sorry, Hooty.
Flips it open to a headshot of Azura and holds it up to the mirror]
This is it, old girl.
Your first day on the Boiling Isles, as a Witch Apprentice.
Hyah!
Please have witchy clothes.
Please have witchy clothes.
Please have witchy clothes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Good morning, Eda the Owl Lady.
I am ready for my first day of Witch Apprenticeship.
Huh?
Remember me?
We freed the oppressed and defeated the evil warden together?
Yesterday?
You mean apple juice?
Teach me some spells.
When do I get a magic staff?
Was I supposed to bring my own runes?
Do you have a dangerous magical quest for me?
More than anything.
Snake oil.
I won't let you down, Miss Eda.
No, I won't.
Woah!
I've only seen places like this in my dreams.
It's incredible.
And I'm the only human here?
Wow!
There must be a reason for that, right?
Why am I here?
What if I, Luz Noceda, average teen, actually had... a predetermined path of greatness?
Today I'm delivering packages, but tomorrow I'll be earning the respect of everyone on the Boiling Isles with my magical prowess.
More like a cesspool of delight.
What has four hooves and wants to buy a potion?
I thought being the only human in a magical world would make me special.
But apparently, it just makes everyone want to scream at me or... eat me.
At this point, Azura had already been sent on an enchanted quest.
Where's my quest-granting wizard?
This has been a rough day.
Let's just deliver this last package and go home.
Hello?
I-I'm delivering a package from Miss Eda, the Owl Lady.
Huh?
Today just got good.
Magical wizard!
Okay.
But the stars on his robe are sparkling.
And look, there's a baby fox in his beard.
Plus, I see scones on the table.
We'd love to join you for tea.
Do you sell potions, Sir Wizard?
Well, I'm kinda, sorta, her apprentice.
Can I be honest, Mr Adegast?
When I decided to stay in this magical world, I thought I was meant for something special.
But Eda thinks I'm meant for chores and I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.
A quest?
Yes!
Love peril. Big fan of peril.
Yes, we have to go and pack for this enchanted quest!
I'm in.
So, King, what kind of Chosen One should I be?
Should I be full of optimism and goodness, like the Good Witch Azura?
Or should I be like a bad girl Chosen One with black nail polish and a mysteriously withdrawn attitude?
I act like I don't care, but I secretly do.
What?
Can I have some time alone?
Maybe they were right.
Huh?
The path will only appear to the worthy.
That's why Eda couldn't see it.
But am... I really worthy?
I'll never know unless I try.
My first mythical quest.
Okay.
Got my scroll, got my youthful optimism, got my trusty weapon.
You know, I wonder if I made the right choice by coming here.
Wow!
Yes.
Yes, I did make the right choice.
Nevareth, your vengeful backstory is so compelling.
And I'm lovin' your animal sidekick.
This quest is questing in all the right ways.
Hit me, little furry man.
Hmm.
Wow.
This is amazing.
Thank you.
Yes.
I need a cape.
Thank you for inviting me to your feast, Princess.
All your food was so tiny and cute.
Thank you.
You have all been so kind and thoughtful.
I hope this quest never ends.
I knew this world wasn't all gloom and doom like Eda and King said.
There is wonder here.
And I... I think I came here for a reason.
Okay, this is it.
Moment of truth.
Yes!
I am the Chosen One!
I knew it!
I always suspected there was a reason nobody understood my wacky antics back at home.
Now I have concrete proof.
What?
Huh?
Okay, Luz, don't panic.
This is classic Chosen One biz.
You just have to rescue everybody and defeat the final boss.
What?
Betrayed by my own cool accessories.
Why are you doing this?
Does everybody have a beef with Eda here?
Joke's on you, 'cause Eda isn't stupid enough to fall for your trap.
Oh, heck!
It is beautiful here.
And you guys think I'm special.
But it's not real.
I am a Witch's Apprentice.
And I'm gonna earn my magic staff the hard way.
I believed you, Magic Man.
Now feel my wrath!
I thought we had a connection, Nevareth!
King, I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you and never trusted that wizard.
You were right.
He isn't mystical or magical.
He's just a big, slimy jerk.
I'm just confused.
This place is nothing like I imagined.
Whoa!
It's beautiful.
Eda, how did you know that wizard was lying?
Does that mean you'll give me a magic staff of my own?
I don't care what Belos is up to... because today, I'm saving Eda!
This is serious, King.
Eda used her power to save me and got caught by Lilith.
Now she's the Owl Beast and is being taken before the Emperor!
I don't know what he's planning to do with Eda, but I'm going to rescue her.
King, please try to understand.
Eda is in this situation because of me.
Because of my stupid choice.
I have to make up for it.
I don't know.
But I have to try anyway.
King... Alright.
Then we've got no time to lose!
Please tell me that's not as bad as it sounds.
She cursed Eda.
She captured her own sister!
She is the worst!
If I ever see her again!
You're right, but how will we get to the Conformatorium in time?
Hey!
Yep.
Perfect plan.
Where's Eda?
Draw me a map!
King, watch the door.
Eda?
Eda!
Eda, wait!
It's me!
It's me.
It's okay Eda, I'm here to save you.
But, but I can't!
It's my fault you needed to save me.
It's my fault you got captured.
But we're a family!
Us weirdos have to stick together, remember?
I love you, Eda.
Not yet!
Eda!
You hurt Eda.
You put her in chains.
And now, I will take you down!
Talk to the glyph, witch!
Fire!
What?
No way!
You deserve to be petrified!
Not Eda!
Why did you do all this?
How do I know I can trust you?
You're okay.
All right, Lilith.
I don't like your whole deal, but... we need your help to save Eda.
I'm coming.
Thank you, Lilith.
What will you do now?
That's good to hear.
Wait, why are there no guards around?
Lilith!
King!
Let my friends go, or else!
Huh?
Not even close.
But... my home.
Fine!
She hugs the door to her chest.
Lo siento, mamá.
Here, it's yours.
I may have lost, but so have you.
Free them, now!
Eda!
Are you okay?
Don't worry, Eda.
Eda!
Can you still do magic?
It's okay.
I can teach you what I know, and what we don't know, we can learn together.
And that's how we escaped from the Emperor.
Everyone told me he was the most powerful witch alive.
But look at this, Mom.
I chipped off a piece of his mask!
I know he's not invincible now.
It's a strange feeling, having gone through so much and, not having you here to share it with.
And I don't know when or how I'm gonna see you again.
But I will find my way home to you.
I promise.
Deja una luz puesta para mí.
Te quiero.
