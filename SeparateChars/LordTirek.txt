[heavy breathing]
Is he friend or is he foe, the pony wonders.
I can assure you...
I am no friend.
I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago.
[laughing]
Discord.
You're free?
I commend you on your escape.
Oh, I should have known you would want to have Equestria all to yourself.
Fluttershy?
You're not saying you're friends with ponies?
I am surprised that someone with your intellect does not see this 'friendship' is but a new form of imprisonment.
Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces.
Oh, please, I've seen this before.
But he was always weak minded.
You are Discord, you are legend, you cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother!
Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded with something far greater than friendship.
Freedom.
Once I've stripped these ponies of their magic, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see their world turned upside down.
Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself?
Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness.
Unless, of course, 'pony errand boy' is the role you've always wanted to play in this world.
I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago.
Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness.
What can't be right?
The only one Discord betrayed was himself.
Abandoning his true nature to make friends with weak-minded equines who offer him nothing!
[laughs, chews]
Why don't you go and have a little fun?
I won't stand in your way.
[inhales]
What have you done?
[inhales]
Where is your magic?
Getting rid of your magic so that I cannot take it from you?
That was your plan?
How does it feel, knowing that soon, every Pegasus, unicorn and Earth pony will bow to my will, and that there is nothing you can do to stop it?
Give my regards to Cerberus.
Of course.
Here, I want you to have something.
This was given to me by someone very close to me.
I give it to you as a sign of my gratitude and loyalty.
[laughs]
Amusing.
But we have no time for such things.
With the princesses out of the way, we can now?
is this meant to be humorous?
There's a fourth?
And you did not tell me this?
Then where can we find this fourth princess?
Where is her castle?
Not for much longer.
You've gathered up all of them?
[inhales]
You really think she'd do anything for them?
Who said anything about us?
You've helped me grow strong, you've provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight's magic, and now you are no longer of any use to me.
My brother who betrayed me.
It is as worthless as he is.
Princess Twilight!
You have something that belongs to me!
You're going to give me what I want!
[inhales]
Now I understand what your fellow princesses have done!
[roars]
[roars]
It appears we are at an impasse.
How about a trade, Princess Twilight?
Their release for all the Alicorn magic in Equestria.
What's it going to be, Princess?
Enough!
I want an answer, and I want it now!
As you wish.
After the way he has betrayed you, you still call him a 'friend'?
If that's what you want.
Your turn.
[roars]
Yes!
How is this possible?
You have no magic!
[screaming]
The Princess of Friendship here for a visit.
What have I done to earn the honor of your company?
I know.
What a waste of such...
[slurping]
...mmmm, delicious power.
Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here?
But I might know something about it...
If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory.
What do you say?
I scratch your back, you scratch mine?
[chuckles]
What a pity.
Well, for you.
Sweet revenge for me.
It seems my little prot‚g‚'s plan worked after all.
Oh, we've never met.
We're pen pals.
Each letter had so many questions about draining magic.
I was bored.
So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
Oh, why not?
The irony is too perfect.
Her name is...
It seems my little prot‚g‚'s plan worked after all.
[laughs]
I'm not usually a fan of ponies, but draining your precious world of magic so she could trap the six of you was inspiring!
[laughs, coughs]
Cozy Glow outsmarted the six of you!
I doubt this Starlight stands a chance!
[coughs]
But that is just what it will be!
If my prot‚g‚ has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight, every last vestige of Equestrian magic will disappear into the ether forever!
It means the six of you will be trapped here!
Like me!
Uhhhh...
I hadn't thought of it like that.
Fine!
I'll help you leave!
Just please stop!
Yes, by all means, please!
Just get on with it!
Of course it's boring here now!
But at least you're not in a cage!
It is Lord Tirek.
And what is it now?
[groans]
A changeling?
See?
She gets it.
I thought that you were a legend!
[kisses]
Grogar is ancient and extremely powerful.
The land that would become Equestria was a mere collection of farms and pastures until he declared himself emperor of all he saw.
I remember hearing tales of his tyranny when I was young.
Because they are annoyingly lucky.
Did he succeed?
Uh, not I.
Don't trust anything that nosy little Pegasus says!
Hmph!
[grunting]
No, he didn't.
Fine!
I'll join your meeting.
Just leave!
[spits]
I wasn't doing anything of the sort!
How dare you!
How could I not?
You tell your log every five minutes.
Ah, please!
[groans]
Ah, your rhythm was way off!
Assuming you even have a plan.
I absorbed all the magic of Equestria!
I could feel it flowing through my body as I grew!
Scale the mountain...
[blows]
[coughs, spits]
[laughing]
Didn't make it to the top?
Surprise, surprise.
I didn't try to.
It took about five minutes to deduce that Grogar was right.
None of us could make it up alone.
So, rather than subject myself to the elements, I decided to let you two face the danger, take what you learned, and use it to my advantage.
[laughs]
I'd had enough of you trying to manipulate me with that insincere, syrupy sweetness.
At least now we can see the real you.
[scoffs]
No, you're not.
You're annoying, and you snore.
[mock-snoring]
Don't you dare bring Gram-Gram into this!
Wait.
Clearly I was right to wait.
Now tell me everything you learned today.
Leave nothing out.
Those ponies have weaknesses.
I used that turncoat Discord.
Tricked him into helping me capture his so-called friends.
You should've seen Twilight's face when her friends appeared in bubbles around me.
She was all...
[exaggerated groaning]
All magic was a little excessive, don't you think?
Indeed it would.
Who wouldn't love to see those prissy ponies realize they lost everything?
You know, working with you two may not be the worst thing.
[pained groan]
I can only absorb magic from living beings.
I do?
I'll give you your magic back.
So...
much...
power!
[kisses]
Welcome back, baby!
It's not big enough for me!
[chuckles, grunts]
Can't...
hold...
much...
longer!
Hurry!
Neither was I.
But working together seemed smarter than to continue fighting.
All of these years taking power from ponies...
Obviously.
After that, we can go back to trying to destroy each other!
We worked together as you asked.
Whatever you command!
I don't trust him.
If we can figure out how to use it.
Celestia and Luna love to hoard information for themselves.
If there's an answer, it's there.
Why are so many ponies up in the middle of the night?
Are you sure about that?
Increased security on a crowded holiday with Twilight and her friends bumbling around?
This is impossible.
[laughing]
Hmph!
I don't have to like it.
And no time to waste.
We have to master the Bell before Grogar returns.
Ah, Chrysalis.
Another successful field trip, I presume?
And Grogar's long absence has given me time to prepare the next part of our plan.
[blows]
Grogar's Bell.
This artifact can steal any creature's magic.
It holds that magic until it is released by this spell.
Which means all the power inside is ours for the taking!
[kissing]
Take my hands.
So we can all be part of the spell.
Unless you'd prefer I take all the magic myself?
That was unexpected.
[in Discord's voice]
I hope you got a name picked out for your future kingdom.
Because it's time to destroy Equestria!
She's...
not as annoying as I expected.
But taking it all would be madness!
It's impossible for any other creature to control!
Still think chaos magic is a good idea?
[laughs, grunts]
[cackling]
[smacks lips]
Magic seasoned with age.
Delicious.
Oh, run along.
The big stallions are playing.
Ahhhh.
The perfect dessert to a legendary meal.
Didn't you all notice something was wrong in Equestria?
We've been busy.
Destroy some crops, cause some damage...
There's no backup friends or rainbow magic to save you now!
'Cause when you have to protect yourself, you don't have time for anypony else.
We should hunt down Twilight Sparkle.
As long as she's out there, she's dangerous.
What are you doing?
You saw what happened when you tried to take Discord's chaos magic.
What are you talking about?
Stay away from the Bell, you pest!
None of us can use the Alicorns' magic until we figure out how to handle that fool's ridiculous chaos magic!
He's lying.
He won't tell us.
This cretin could destroy you before you blink, so choose your words carefully.
Every prisoner is safely in their cells.
Now we can hunt down the rest of the?
Windigos?
You mean us.
The windigos are ancient magic.
It would be unwise to leave them unchecked.
Best we deal with them now.
Thought it was too cold for you to hunt anypony down.
Aah!
Turns out that the Magic of Friendship is your biggest weakness.
A fitting end to your pathetic story.
Don't let them escape!
