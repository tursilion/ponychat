(Interrupting) Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
I'm here to announce that King Mufasa is on his way.
So you'd better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning.
Hah!
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a Hippo with a Hernia.
(very concerned) Now Scar, don't look at me that way...
HELP!
Impeccable timing your majesty.
(slimed) errrah.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should have been first in line!
Pity!
Why not?
(deep sigh) There's one in every family, sire... two in mine, actually.
And they always manage to ruin special occasions.
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
And just think!
Whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.
(Lights on a nearby rock) Good morning sire!
Checking in with the morning report.
Well, the buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot...
And the baboons are going ape over this.
Of course, the giraffes are acting like they're above it all....
... The tick birds are preening on the elephants.
I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't...
Yes, sire.
(continuing immediately) The Cheetahs are hard up but I always say -- cheetahs never prosper.
(realizing something is amiss) What's going on?
Oh very good.
Pouncing.
(Realizing) Pouncing !
Oh, no, sire -- you can't be serious...
Oh, this is so humiliating.
What are you telling him, Mufasa?
Simba?
Yes?
(interrupting and with urgency) Sire!
Hyenas!
In the pride lands!
Oh, young master, one day you will be king; then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.
Step Lively.
The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.
(Flying down) Oh, just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah.
Your parents will be thrilled, what, with your being betrothed and all.
Betrothed.
Intended.
Affianced.
One day you two are going to be married.
Well sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice.
It's a tradition going back generations.
Not so long as I'm around.
Hmmm... nice try, but only the king can do that.
Not yet I don't.
And with an attitude like that, I'm afraid you shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed.
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts With quite so little hair.
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing.
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...
I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart.
If this is where the monarchy is headed Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about!
Not Yet!
I beg your pardon, madam, but... GET OFF!
Simba?
Nala?
The only checking out you will do, will be to check out of here.
We're way beyond the boundary of the pride lands.
It's Mr Banana Beak to you, fuzzy.
And right now we are all in very real danger.
And quite by accident, let me assure you.
A simple navigational error.
I, madam, am the king's Majordomo.
A-ha-ha, technically, they can.
We are on their land.
Ix-nay on the oopid-stay.
(Harried) My, my, my.
Look at the sun.
It's time to go.
Oh no.
Not the birdie boiler.
Yes, sire?
Come, Nala.
Simba -- Good luck.
Oh look sire.
The herd is on the move.
Your father is on the way!
Hold on!
There!
There!
On that tree!
Oh Scar, this is awful.
What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Hah!
I'll go back for help!
That's what I'll do!
Nobody knows The trouble I've seen... nobody knows my sorrow...
It's a small world after all...
I've got a lovely bunch of Coconuts (diddely-dee-dee) There they are a standing in the row.
Oooh, I would never have had to do this for Mufasa.
Oh, nothing!
Yes, sire.
You are the king.
I... I... Well, I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences of your... royal managerial approaches.
Oh, you wouldn't want me.
I'd be so tough and gamy and -- eewwgh
Let me out!
Let me out!
Nothing there but a bunch of backstabbing, murderous Outsiders!
Don't worry, Simba.
She'll be fine.
What could happen?
I must tell Simba!
Mmm... yes, sire.
Clearly we are in his debt... and royal protocol demands that all debts be paid.
Though in this case you might want to make an exception.
Hmph!
Riffraff.
Oh yes!
Help... at once!
Of course!
Sire!
The Outsiders are on the attack... heading this way!
It's war!
Look, sire, how they kneel before the royal son.
Sire, the hyenas are after the children!
