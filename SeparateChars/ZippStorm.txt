Whoa!
A unicorn?
And an Earth pony?
Together?
Okay, well, this day just got a whole lot more interesting.
Don't tell them you saw me!
I'm sorry you two got thrown in here, but I have to talk to you.
Zipp. Just call me Zipp.
Sunny, Izzy, I really need to ask you something important about magic.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.
Lost theirs?
As in no magic?
Well that changes things.
Listen, I might have some information that could help, but first, you need to tell me about this.
Yeah, I can be pretty sneaky when I want to be.
So where did that come from?
Right.
Then why are you here?
In a wing beat.
I have to show you something.
You comin' or what?
Watch your step.
It's amazing, right?
I'm pretty sure it was some sort of station for when Earth ponies and unicorns used to visit Zephyr Heights.
It's like everypony just forgot.
The truth is we can't fly either.
We've been faking it.
You'd be surprised what some wires and good lighting will do.
But I'm just so tired of living that ridiculous lie.
That's why I come down here – to get away from all of that.
And, well, to do this.
But that's not why I brought you down here.
This is what I wanted to show you.
This was made a long, long time ago, when we still had magic.
That's the Pegasus Crystal.
It's part of my mom's crown.
So what are you saying? Magic will return?
All right!
Aw, but what about the Unicorn Crystal?
Ooh, that'll be tricky.
She, uh, never takes her crown off.
I got it!
Pipp's performing at tonight's royal celebration.
All eyes will be on her, especially my mom's.
She'll be distracted.
So we just need to swap the real crown with a fake.
I'll get the supplies.
I'll pass them off to Sunny, and then she will get them to you.
Once you produce the decoy, get your flanks to the palace.
Everypony who's anypony will be there, so security will be tight.
I'll distract them so you can sneak in.
You'll need to be stealthy.
Carefully make your way to the Grand Hall, but watch out for the guards.
I'll open the door to the backstage of the throne room.
And once Pipp starts singing, my mom will be so caught up that swapping the crowns will be easy-breezy.
Pipp told you?
Actually, there is something I wanted to tell you.
The unicorns don't have any magic.
Because it's a lie!
Ugh.
Let's go!
Quick, this way!
Oh-ho-ho, gee, thanks.
But we don't need any saving, okay?
Huh.
Look at that.
The sheriff just became a detective.
Seriously?
But it could be anywhere!
Trust me.
It was.
Pipp!
Forget about all that.
We think we can bring back magic, but we need that crystal.
Please.
This might be our only chance.
Don't you trust me at all?
Look, once we get our magic back, the whole kingdom will be so excited, they won't even remember what happened back there?
You'll be a hero, Pipp.
You know what would be great right now?
Let me think.
Maybe something like the ability to fly!
All right!
You need some backup, sheriff?
Oh, well, that was sad to watch.
Come on, don't be a hero, dude.
Come get warm.
Did you make all of this?
Ah, cool.
Whoa!
This is not what I signed up for.
Geez!
She does know we're just looking for the one, right?
Ooooookay, I'm gonna need some context.
Um, what are you doing?
You escaped!
Trust us.
What do we do now, Sunny?
Of course.
Better hurry sheriff.
Yeah!
We just want to stay friends!
We have to stop that thing!
I've got your back, Hitch!
Hitch!
We need to shut these down!
Whoa, Sunny!
Check you out!
Heads up, everypony!
Zipp.
Just call me Zipp.
And don't worry about it.
The magic from the Unity Crystals in the Brighthouse is new to all of us.
It takes practice.
Lucky microphone?
But if Mom knew I was there, I'd get stuck doing one of her random princess lessons.
You don't get it, do you?
We can't just sing a song and ignore everything!
If we lose magic this time, we may never get it back again!
And it'll be our fault.
I think I finally know what's happening to magic.
Why it's glitching.
It's the Crystal.
They might be powered by ponies.
Okay.
Check this out.
Pipp, when we were fillies, I used to steal Mom's chocolate-dipped cherries and blame it on you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And guess what.
I don't like karaoke!
It's the worst!
UGH!
And the more unstable magic becomes in Equestria.
Yup!
Everything is all out of whack!
I don't know.
I want to find out.
But if we want to keep magic in Equestria, first we need to get everypony back on the same page.
The magic!
I-It's gone!
That's it!
Come on, unicorns!
Come on, Pegasi!
Help the Earth ponies!
Can someone get me down?
It's a mess.
Stop trying to make Zippsters happen, Pipp!
I don't want followers!
Whoa.
Somepony really needs to teach these Pegasi how to fly.
No-no-no-no-no!
Welcome to W-I-N-G-S.
The Wonderful Institute of No-Gravity Skywalking?
It's really more of a one-off training day.
Ugh, whatever.
Let's just get started.
Who can tell me how to do a double roulette twist?
What is it?
Not you, Windy.
Obstacle course?
I don't have an
What?
Where did that come from?
...Fine.
Everyone, watch carefully.
Easy.
Now who wants to go first?
All right.
You're up, Thunder.
This is gonna be a loooong day.
Okaaaay... Next?
Well, I'm sure you all enjoyed that more than I did.
Good luck.
Thanks, Izzy.
All right!
Listen up!
I'm gonna get you flying if it's the last thing I do!
Before five.
Day ends at five.
Cadets!
This morning, you looked like a bunch of Earth ponies with wings taped to your back!
But now you're captains of the sky!
You may now throw your hats.
I suppose it was kind of fun.
You know, maybe I'll run that flight school after all... when crabs fly!
Hurry up, Pipp.
Mom wants to say a little goodbye.
Everything okay in there?
Let's go.
Grab your bag.
For the record, mother, this is not a little goodbye!
Aah!
Pipp!
No pictures!
And which part exactly would I want to remember?
I don't know.
But I know I'm ready for a new adventure.
You know, together.
Easy, ponies.
It's a bedsheet.
Waking up?
We didn't sleep!
Everything's ruined!
Uh, Izzy?
The gift is inside the box?
'Cause it was getting kinda annoying.
Hey, honesty is the best policy, right?
You're already perfect as you are.
Pipp!
There you are.
You have to come back inside.
You are.
Always have been.
Always will be.
So you shaved one bald spot.
Big whoop.
See all that confidence and swagger?
You brought that to Maretime Bay.
You did that.
You the style icon!
Whoo!
I can't wait!
And how cool was that ropes course?
I'm definitely going to check that out.
I feel more at home now.
Yeah!
Upload that!
Oh, uh, is that the time?
Gotta do that thing I was telling you about.
Sunny?
You remember?
That thing?
Hitch!
Is this a good time?
You seem to be a little... tied up.
You really should find a new deputy.
Hey, Hitch!
I came to— Huh.
Huh?
Uhhh, whatcha doin'... in there... buddy?
Um, Hitch?
These are all your favorite things.
This smells like a setup and... super citrus smoothie?
Ohhhh, so you do need help?
Good idea.
Now go get 'em, sheriff!
Ugh!
The Pegasus marathon already started!
Yeah.
I was flying and thought I saw her with a huge unicorn made of junk.
I think she's losing it, too.
How many hooves am I holding up?
We thought you lost it.
Sorry, Sunny!
Gotta rush!
Let's hope so.
It's getting late, and they should've been back ages ago.
Something's not right.
Hitch, I'm telling you.
This is the fastest way home.
Uh, Izzy?
I think it might be time for some new lyrics.
Aah!
Ugh!
