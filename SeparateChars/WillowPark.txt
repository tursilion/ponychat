Like ancient relics!
Look, it's the Plant Coven's Green Thumb Gauntlet!
It can grow whatever you imagine.
Yeah!
You can't miss this!
Hey Luz!
I was just saying we were getting close to the castle.
Emperor Belos built it as a symbol of unity.
Before he came to power, folks were doing magic all wrong.
He taught us that the only way to respect what the Titan gave us is through joining covens.
It's a shame Amity couldn't make it.
She would LOVE this trip.
No offense to Eda, but the Emperor is the most skilled witch that's ever lived.
He can even talk to the Titan.
Luz, you'll like this.
It's where... huh?
Oh, I could grow such beautiful things with that.
You were planning on taking the Healing Hat, weren't you?
Luz, no matter what, you can't steal this hat.
Hey!
I wanted to say that!
We learned about Eda's curse from your notes.
We're totally gonna help you.
Whoa!
I just wanted to try it out.
Stand back!
Run, Luz!
Luz!
Eda, we have some bad news...
It's the annual covention!
Student witches get to see all the types of covens before they're placed in one.
There's even a mystery guest this year!
Mmm.
Maybe this informative event will inspire you to join a coven.
There's Flower Coven, Artist Coven, Big Dog Coven, Small Cat Coven, Tiniest Cat Coven...
Also the Grumpy Coven.
That's the Construction Coven.
One of the main nine.
They use power glyphs to increase their strength.
Only one way to find out!
Luz is in a witch's duel!
She cheated!
The more I look at him, the more uncomfortable I get.
Oh yeah!
I forgot you've never been here for the social event of the season.
That's, uh, not something people usually sign up for.
He's announcing who'll be this year's Grom royalty.
You might want to give her some space.
Being Grom queen is a tough job.
Amity's having a moonlight conjuring and invited everyone but me.
You spend the night at someone's house, telling stories, playing games...
Then you bring something to life with moon magic!
Gus and I have never been to one.
Luz!
What did Eda say?
Oh, I can't believe I finally have enough friends for a moonlight conjuring!
Thank you, Luz!
Did Eda say it was okay?
Oh, you're the best!
I'm a sneaky sneakster!
And best of all we have actual friends to do the conjuring with!
This is so exciting!
Well first, we find something to animate.
Since it's our first time we should pick something meaningful.
That's not exactly what I meant by beautiful.
According to the conjuring books I've read, we say the incantation and make a connection with the doll.
No, I think... I think we might've animated the house by accident!
Our magic must've spread through the house instead of the doll!
We're controlling it with the power of friendship.
She noticed us.
What do we do?
We should follow her to Amity's house to show off our conjuring.
That will show her who's got no talent.
Look, Amity's house.
Time to show Amity what a real conjuring looks like.
What happened?
I'm sorry, Luz.
You shouldn't ask me to help with anything.
Luz, I'm so sorry.
You wanted to turn back but I just had to show off to Amity.
The truth is she and I used to be friends.
We played together as kids, but when she got her magical powers and I didn't, she stopped hanging out with me.
I just wanted to prove to her that I was a powerful witch, too.
Now, if I could just reach that root.
Gotcha!
We may be children, but we're also witches.
Don't punish Luz.
We're the ones who pushed her to do the conjuring.
Yes, Luz.
I did.
Yeah.
Too bad no one will know of our daring adventures.
Hi, Amity.
Oh, see you in class, superstar!
I hate when she does that.
I hate making abominations.
I hate getting bad grades.
Ugh!
I can't stand this anymore.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm so sorry!
So... circly.
You're human!
This is astounding!
A human on the Boiling Isles!
How'd you get here?
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm sorry.
I can't stay.
I have to go disappoint my teacher.
It was nice to meet you, human.
Thanks, but... I'm not even supposed to be doing plant magic.
My parents put me in the abomination track at school.
I wish I could get a passing grade for once.
Then people would stop calling me Half-a-Witch Willow.
What?
That's true.
Okay.
It's a deal.
Luz.
Welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics.
Remember to stay hidden, okay?
Hmm?
Psh.
I haven't seen any.
What?
Okay, Augustus.
I'm gonna tell you something.
But you have to be cool.
Luz, that's not how abominations act.
He's the president of the Human Appreciation Society.
Most witches wouldn't be able to recognize a human right away.
But Augustus is an expert.
All right.
Into the darkness you go.
Uh... Thank you, sir.
I, uh, took your pep talk to heart, Amity.
Uh-oh.
I think Amity is onto us.
I don't know, Gus.
If Amity saw that...
Oh, I have her list of ingredients right here.
Uh, you can't just cut open a human, can you?
Well, how do you like it?
Okay, we should get out of here before Bump seals us in.
Oh, this is awful.
I don't know what to do.
Amity's right.
I'm just Half-a-Witch Willow.
That's it!
Luz, it's a seed!
Thank goodness you had it on you.
Please grow!
Get outta here!
I may get detention, but you'll get dissected.
Luz!
You won't believe it, Luz.
Everything is perfect now!
Principal Bump was so impressed by my plant work he's switching me to the plant magic track!
Look!
But we could come here and teach you what we learned.
You make doing homework actually fun.
Luz!
I got an invitation from Tibbles.
But who cares?
This place has a Scarris wheel.
We can help with that.
So the pixie infestation was actually caused when Boscha's pet pixie escaped its cage...
When Luz comes back let's go on the three-man cauldron spinner.
Oh, and that's close to those photo booths that can fit exactly three people.
Ugh.
Sketchy carnival rides are not to blame this time.
King had something in his pouch that made us small.
Gus... Enough of this!
We have to find Luz and get her attention before any more carnival animals hunt us down.
Eat up, my stead.
Lead us to safety.
Because up close, everything is hairy.
We won't have to for much longer.
Wait, Luz, don't do it!
You splashed us with something to make us small.
Looks like we ruined his life for a second time.
Thank you, King.
This isn't gonna work out at all.
You lied to our best friend and told her you got the ban lifted.
That seems like a potential problem to me.
Really?
What about all the wanted posters around school?
Do you always have confetti on you or...
Oh, Gus.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Maybe I've been too hard on Gus.
I mean, what trouble could they get into?
Luz!
I can show you guys what plants not to touch in the greenhouse.
And then I can let you touch them.
Hello, classmate!
So, do you know who those witches are?
Those are the heads of the main nine covens.
Each one excelled at a magic school like Glandus, St Epiderm, and, of course, Hexside.
Are you prepared to enter these hallowed halls?
Luz!
The detention track?
You can't do anything in there.
Luz?
We're here to get you out of that horrible class.
We have to find Luz.
If only these walls could talk.
Thank you, walls!
We found a way to get you out to talk to Principal Bump.
Don't worry, Luz!
Once we talk to Bump, we'll get everything sorted out.
We may be cute, but we're nobody's morsels!
I feel... so weak.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
It's funny 'cause it's stupid!
I'll admit, I was adorable.
Be careful with my brain!
Ugh.
No, I'd rather do this.
That's my motto after all!
Out of sight, out of mind.
Luz, I get it, but I don't want you to do that.
No schemes, no plots, no ruses, none!
Okay?
Now let's get to lunch!
When did it get so hot?
Uhh, hi!
I'm Willow!
Remind me of your names?
I'm-I'm serious!
Who-who are you?
Have I always had this crazy thing?
Blap, blap!
Eeee, heee, heee, I can tell we're gonna be good friends!
Ahh, a chair for sitting!
I got it!
Ooh, a furry fruit!
I'm gonna peel it!
A friendly scarecrow?
just messing, I remember everything!
I remember what you did too.
What you did in there.
I can't say we're friends, but it's... a start.
Luz, question... how did Amity happen to see the photo I hid in class?
Aw, shucks!
Azura challenges Hecate in the smibbitch championship.
But will she risk it all by taking a chance on the deadly Thorn Vault?
Uh, the Pixie Dust Taxes?
Ever since I patched thing up with Amity, I’ve been feeling more confident.
I guess it shows.
I’m really sorry I pulled you guys into this.
We should have just kept a low profile.
Boscha could get away with murder if she wanted to.
I what?
Luz, what are you doing?
Or we could just talk about our issues.
Oh, no.
Yeah, I’ve never even played Grudgby before!
How am I supposed to beat Boscha?
Well, if you think this’ll work, then I’m in.
How about you, Gus?
I need a cup of water.
Luz, wait...
Gus!
Talk to me, Gus!
Come on, Gus.
I have some floral tape in the greenhouse.
We’ll fix them.
Not now, Luz.
We’re tired.
Luz!
Not everything can be solved with a good attitude and a dope music soundtrack.
We’re going to lose.
And no movie can help us against that.
The game is off.
There, that ought to do it.
Boscha.
Your issue is with me, not Luz.
Leave her be.
It’s okay.
I know you were just trying help in your Luz way.
But now let’s finish this my way.
The game is back on.
There’s something on your shoe.
And this play could determine whether us underdogs win or lose.
I think we should try this one.
I’m ready this time.
Oh, thorns.
She caught the Rusty Smidge.
Oh, really?
Mm, thanks for the offer, but I think I’m done with grudgby for a while.
Yes.
We have to do something.
If we know anything about Luz, she's going to be here trying to save Eda.
Let's split up and find her!
I don't see Luz anywhere
We gotta do something.
Yeah.
What's happening to Eda isn't right.
She might not always follow the rules, but she hasn't done anything worthy of a petrification!
The Emperor should let Eda go.
After years of thinking I wasn't good enough, I finally found something I can be good at.
Something I wanna be good at.
Switching to the Plant Track was just the beginning.
I'm on my way to becoming the witch I wanna be.
I can do this!
Eye of the liger, girl.
Knock'em dead!
Thanks.
But... I'm interested in something with a little more... drama, flare, and face paint.
Flyer derby!
Ever since our grudgby match, I've been playing it at home.
Today I'm starting Hexside's first Flyer Derby team!
Let out your inner flying freak!
Once the Flyer Derby club is approved, we'll travel all across the Isles in rocking outfits and working as a team!
But Amity and Luz are busy and... I don't know where to find enough decent players this fast.
Hey, you!
Wanna join my Flyer Derby team?
This is Gus Porter, and I'm Willow Park, future captain of Hexside's first Flyer Derby team.
Your flying was amazing.
You're a new student, right?
At least take a pamphlet?
Absolutely!
Flyer Derby's not for the faint witch.
Really?
Um... we... might not have time for all that.
But... you can help by attracting people with your sick sky skills.
Students of Hexside!
Got a palisman?
Got a need for thrills, chills and theatrics?
Well, THIS could be you!
Man, this Caleb guy is great.
With him, I think we can really get our Derby team approved.
Come on down!
Allow me to introduce you to... the best, and the brightest of Hexside.
Just a few months ago, I'd be considered the weak link on any team.
But now I'm leading one!
Ooh!
Okay, girl, don't let the power get to your head just yet.
Hmm?
Where are you going?
The field is this-a-way.
You just met them!
Give them a chance!
Gus is a natural speed demon, Skara's a strategic wizard, and Viney's the best healer in school.
And at one point or another, we've all been misjudged.
So, still think we're pathetic?
Good.
Let's get our game faces on.
Caleb!
Waiting on you, buddy!
All you got to do is fly high and snag some flags.
Shoot.
We never thought of a name.
Entrails team photo!
We're number one!
We wouldn't have gotten here without you.
Y-Y-Y-You can't be serious?
You're not the one Luz told us about, right?
But we're here because I made a bad call.
I'm just half-a-witch Willow.
Land the ship!
Let's move, team.
We need to find a replacement.
After all, it'll be 52 weeks before Caleb's next day off.
Wow.
He is a slow typer.
Hey, guys.
Just had our first team win as the Emerald Entrails.
Did you hear that, Gus?
This is what happens when you go missing for a week.
Yes, we are ready to attack this on all fronts.
I gotta admit it Amity, seeing you around more often is different.
Luz, no!
You are not well.
Will you guys please be quiet?
What if, we play them at the same time?
I guess this is goodbye.
I'll water you one last time with my tears!
Come on Luz, we can figure this out on our own.
No one's dying.
No, ah!
Help, Luz!
Help, Luz!
Okay, I can use the root system underground to tunnel our way in.
This isn't a cartoon from the '40s, Gus!
We need a better plan!
We are running out of time!
We gotta get in now!
Amity, wait!
I heard there’s just a mirror underneath.
The real emperor was society all along.
Did you finish building the door?
Yeah.
I guess it has… Are you okay?
You need to slow down for me.
Mmm… Mm-mmm.
Listen, Blight, if you want my advice, there’s something you have to do for me first… Do you still know how to braid hair?
Oh, sorry, Luz.
I heard she stayed home today.
Your loss!
I want to be strong and wise to protect everyone I love.
And if anyone gets in my way, they'll feel the sting of defeat.
Oh, my gosh!
I'm gonna take such good care of you.
I went by and checked out the Owl House.
It was crawling with Coven Scouts.
I was thinking of capturing one for information, but I didn't want to bring any more attention to Luz and Eda.
I'm fine.
We just started hanging out again, and, she needs time to get to know the new me.
Mm-hmm.
I think it's an illusion.
I got it.
I got this!
What are you doing?
I don't want your protection!
I want you to see who I really am!
Augustus!
I've been looking everywhere for you!
Whoa, what is he doing here?
Interesting.
You're scaring me, Hunter!
He's telling the truth.
And he can help us drive Head Witch Graye and his scouts out of the school.
Yeah.
But I'll need help.
Then how about just the two of us?
Gus is trapped in his head!
And the others are being affected too!
We'll hold them off.
You save Gus.
Gus!
Aww, I'm so glad you're okay!
Thanks, Hunter.
Hey, Gus.
Thanks for sending me all those Get well soon illusions but, uh... Can you please take them back?
I... thought I... could be good at this.
Sorry, I- I was trying to be funny, but, I just ended up being horrifying.
thought I was the only one that hid here.
Are you talking to me?
Sometimes I get wrapped up in my own thoughts too.
But my dads taught me a little trick to quiet the voices.
I'm Willow.
