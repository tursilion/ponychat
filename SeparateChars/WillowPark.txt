Like ancient relics!
Look, it's the Plant Coven's Green Thumb Gauntlet!
It can grow whatever you imagine.
Yeah!
You can't miss this!
Hey Luz!
I was just saying we were getting close to the castle.
[she and Luz look over the side of the ship]
Emperor Belos built it as a symbol of unity.
Before he came to power, folks were doing magic all wrong.
He taught us that the only way to respect what the Titan gave us is through joining covens.
It's a shame Amity couldn't make it.
She would LOVE this trip.
[chuckles]
No offense to Eda, but the Emperor is the most skilled witch that's ever lived.
He can even talk to the Titan.
Luz, you'll like this.
It's where- huh?
Oh, I could grow such beautiful things with that.
[pulls out Luz's notepad]
You were planning on taking the Healing Hat, weren't you?
Luz, no matter what, you can't steal this hat.
Hey!
I wanted to say that!
We learned about Eda's curse from your notes.
We're totally gonna help you.
Whoa!
I just wanted to try it out.
[returns Gauntlet; chuckles]
Stand back!
Run, Luz!
Luz!
Eda, we have some bad news...
[holds up a flier]
It's the annual covention!
Student witches get to see all the types of covens before they're placed in one.
There's even a mystery guest this year!
Mmm.
[drops the flier]
[approaching with one of Eda's wanted posters]
Maybe this informative event will inspire you to join a coven.
[as they're all walking]
There's Flower Coven, Artist Coven, Big Dog Coven, Small Cat Coven, Tiniest Cat Coven--
Also the Grumpy Coven.
That's the Construction Coven.
One of the main nine.
They use power glyphs to increase their strength.
Only one way to find out!
Luz is in a witch's duel!
[hushed, to Gus]
She cheated!
The more I look at him, the more uncomfortable I get.
Oh yeah!
I forgot you've never been here for the social event of the season.
That's, uh, not something people usually sign up for.
He's announcing who'll be this year's Grom royalty.
You might want to give her some space.
Being Grom queen is a tough job.
Even for Amity.
Them.
Amity's having a moonlight conjuring and invited everyone but me.
You spend the night at someone's house, telling stories, playing games...
[pulls out a book]
Then you bring something to life with moon magic!
Gus and I have never been to one.
You need at least three people and--
[growls, grows several vines from the ground]
Luz!
What did Eda say?
Oh, I can't believe I finally have enough friends for a moonlight conjuring!
Thank you, Luz!
Did Eda say it was okay?
Oh, you're the best!
Release!
I'm a sneaky sneakster!
Enchanting.
And best of all we have actual friends to do the conjuring with!
This is so exciting!
Well first, we find something to animate.
Since it's our first time we should pick something meaningful.
[walks over to some flowers]
Something beautiful.
That's not exactly what I meant by beautiful.
Okay, buff boy it is.
According to the conjuring books I've read, we say the incantation and make a connection with the doll.
No, I think-- I think we might've animated the house by accident!
Our magic must've spread through the house instead of the doll!
We're controlling it with the power of friendship.
Uh, and the moon.
Probably the moon.
Hey, is that...
She noticed us.
What do we do?
We should follow her to Amity's house to show off our conjuring.
That will show her who's got no talent.
Look, Amity's house.
Time to show Amity what a real conjuring looks like.
What happened?
I'm sorry, Luz.
You shouldn't ask me to help with anything.
Luz, I'm so sorry.
You wanted to turn back but I just had to show off to Amity.
The truth is she and I used to be friends.
We played together as kids, but when she got her magical powers and I didn't, she stopped hanging out with me.
[sighs]
I just wanted to prove to her that I was a powerful witch, too.
[grunts as she frees a hand]
There.
Now, if I could just reach that root.
Gotcha!
We may be children, but we're also witches.
Powerful ones.
[stepping in front of Luz]
Don't punish Luz.
We're the ones who pushed her to do the conjuring.
Yes, Luz.
I did.
Yeah.
Too bad no one will know of our daring adventures.
Hi, Amity.
[stands up]
Oh, see you in class, superstar!
 [wipes the star from her forehead]
I hate when she does that.
I hate making abominations.
I hate getting bad grades.
Ugh!
I can't stand this anymore.
[shouts, her eyes glowing green]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm so sorry!
[makes the roots still wrapped around Luz's legs retreat]
So...
circly.
[gasps]
You're human!
This is astounding!
[gasps and grabs Luz's face, then helps her stand and walks around her]
A human on the Boiling Isles!
How'd you get here?
What are you doing here?
[flinches and puts Luz's arm down]
Uh, I'm sorry.
I can't stay.
I have to go disappoint my teacher.
It was nice to meet you, human.
[walks away, half-waving]
Thanks, but...
I'm not even supposed to be doing plant magic.
My parents put me in the abomination track at school.
I wish I could get a passing grade for once.
Then people would stop calling me Half-a-Witch Willow.
What?
That's true.
[giggles]
Okay.
It's a deal.
Luz.
Oops.
Abomination goo.
Welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics.
Remember to stay hidden, okay?
Hmm?
Humans?
Psh.
I haven't seen any.
What?
Okay, Augustus.
I'm gonna tell you something.
But you have to be cool.
Okay.
Abomination, rise.
Luz, that's not how abominations act.
He's the president of the Human Appreciation Society.
Most witches wouldn't be able to recognize a human right away.
But Augustus is an expert.
[waves at Gus]
All right.
Into the darkness you go.
Uh...
Abomination, rise.
Abomination, bow.
Uh-- Thank you, sir.
[gasps]
I, uh, took your pep talk to heart, Amity.
[after Amity rounds a corner]
Uh-oh.
I think Amity is onto us.
I don't know, Gus.
[grumbles]
If Amity saw that...
Principal Bump.
Oh, I have her list of ingredients right here.
[quietly]
Uh, you can't just cut open a human, can you?
Well, how do you like it?
Okay, we should get out of here before--
...Bump seals us in.
Oh, this is awful.
[sinks to the ground]
I don't know what to do.
Amity's right.
I'm just Half-a-Witch Willow.
That's it!
[takes the slime ball]
Luz, it's a seed!
Thank goodness you had it on you.
[puts the seed in her lap and traces a spell circle over it]
Please grow!
[screams]
Get outta here!
I may get detention, but you'll get dissected.
So go!
Luz!
You won't believe it, Luz.
Everything is perfect now!
Principal Bump was so impressed by my plant work he's switching me to the plant magic track!
Look!
[giggles]
But we could come here and teach you what we learned.
[chuckles]
You make doing homework actually fun.
Bye!
Luz!
I got an invitation from Tibbles.
But who cares?
This place has a Scarris wheel.
We can help with that.
So the pixie infestation was actually caused when Boscha's pet pixie escaped its cage...
[to Gus]
When Luz comes back let's go on the three-man cauldron spinner.
Oh, and that's close to those photo booths that can fit exactly three people.
[chuckles]
Ugh.
Sketchy carnival rides are not to blame this time.
King had something in his pouch that made us small.
Gus...
Enough of this!
Quick!
We have to find Luz and get her attention before any more carnival animals hunt us down.
Eat up, my stead.
Lead us to safety.
[climbs onto the fly]
Because up close, everything is hairy.
[grabs Gus and flies away]
[panting]
[gasps]
We won't have to for much longer.
Wait, Luz, don't do it!
You splashed us with something to make us small.
Looks like we ruined his life for a second time.
Thank you, King.
This isn't gonna work out at all.
You lied to our best friend and told her you got the ban lifted.
That seems like a potential problem to me.
Really?
What about all the wanted posters around school?
Do you always have confetti on you or...
Oh, Gus.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Maybe I've been too hard on Gus.
I mean, what trouble could they get into?
Luz!
I can show you guys what plants not to touch in the greenhouse.
And then I can let you touch them.
Hello, classmate!
[winks]
So, do you know who those witches are?
[gestures to nine banners]
Those are the heads of the main nine covens.
Each one excelled at a magic school like Glandus, St.
Epiderm, and, of course, Hexside.
Are you prepared to enter these hallowed halls?
Luz!
The detention track?
You can't do anything in there.
[glances at Gus, shakes her head]
[through the wall]
Luz?
We're here to get you out of that horrible class.
[whistles like she's calling a dog]
We have to find Luz.
If only these walls could talk.
Thank you, walls!
[helps Luz stand]
We found a way to get you out to talk to Principal Bump.
Don't worry, Luz!
Once we talk to Bump, we'll get everything sorted out.
We may be cute, but we're nobody's morsels!
[summons carnivorous plant]
[tries to draw another spell circle]
I feel...
so weak.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[laughs]
It's funny 'cause it's stupid!
I'll admit, I was adorable.
[sighs]
Be careful with my brain!
Ugh.
[turns away]
No, I'd rather do this.
[flips photo around]
That's my motto after all!
Out of sight, out of mind.
Luz, I get it, but I don't want you to do that.
No schemes, no plots, no ruses, none!
Okay?
Now let's get to lunch!
[leaves]
[sweating]
When did it get so hot?
Uhh, hi!
I'm Willow!
Remind me of your names?
I'm-I'm serious!
Who-who are you?
[giggles, wiggling her fingers]
Have I always had this crazy thing?
[slaps her face gently]
Blap, blap!
[walks to Amity and Luz and puts her arms around their shoulders]
Eeee, heee, heee, I can tell we're gonna be good friends!
[falls]
Ahh, a chair for sitting!
I got it!
[looks at King]
Ooh, a furry fruit!
[picks King up]
I'm gonna peel it!
[sits up]
A friendly scarecrow?
just messing, I remember everything!
[to Amity]
I remember what you did too.
What you did in there.
[points to her head]
I can't say we're friends, but it's...
a start.
Luz, question: how did Amity happen to see the photo I hid in class?
Aw, shucks!
[taking the DVD case]
Azura challenges Hecate in the smibbitch championship.
But will she risk it all by taking a chance on the deadly Thorn Vault?
[opens case]
[stands up]
Uh, the Pixie Dust Taxes?
Ever since I patched thing up with Amity, I’ve been feeling more confident.
[gesturing to the flower shaped hair clip she's wearing]
I guess it shows.
[groans]
[sighs]
I’m really sorry I pulled you guys into this.
We should have just kept a low profile.
Boscha could get away with murder if she wanted to.
[screams]
Boscha happened.
I what?
Luz, what are you doing?
Or we could just talk about our issues.
Oh, no.
Yeah, I’ve never even played Grudgby before!
How am I supposed to beat Boscha?
Well, if you think this’ll work, then I’m in.
How about you, Gus?
It is, except...
[sigh]
I need a cup of water.
Luz, wait-
Gus!
Talk to me, Gus!
Come on, Gus.
I have some floral tape in the greenhouse.
We’ll fix them.
Not now, Luz.
We’re tired.
[walking up to Luz]
Luz!
Not everything can be solved with a good attitude and a dope music soundtrack.
We’re going to lose.
And no movie can help us against that.
The game is off.
[leaves]
There, that ought to do it.
Boscha.
Your issue is with me, not Luz.
Leave her be.
It’s okay.
I know you were just trying help in your Luz way.
But now let’s finish this...
my way.
[turns to Boscha]
The game is back on.
Uh, well
[to Boscha]
There’s something on your shoe.
And this play could determine whether us underdogs win or lose.
I think we should try...
[points to plant glyph]
this one.
I’m ready this time.
Oh, thorns.
She caught the Rusty Smidge.
Oh, really?
Mm, thanks for the offer, but I think I’m done with grudgby for a while.
Hey, where’s...
Yes.
We have to do something.
If we know anything about Luz, she's going to be here trying to save Eda.
Let's split up and find her!
I don't see Luz anywhere
We gotta do something.
[grabs Perry's microphone]
Yeah.
What's happening to Eda isn't right.
She might not always follow the rules, but she hasn't done anything worthy of a petrification!
The Emperor should let Eda go.
