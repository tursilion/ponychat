[prolonged gasp]
Surprise!
Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you!
Were you surprised?
Were ya?
Were ya?
Huh huh huh?
Well, that's silly!
What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet?
I mean, duh, bo-ring!
Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember?
You were all hello and I was all [deep gasp]
, remember?
Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!
And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]
I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville!
See?
And now you have lots and lots of friends!
Aww, she's so happy she's crying!
Ooh...
[with mouth full]
What?
It's good!
Isn't this exciting?
Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited?
well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp]
but I mean really, who can top that?
Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games!
Is she hiding?
Ooh, she's good.
[yelp]
Ooh, ooh, more guessing games!
Um, Hokey Smokes!
How about... Queen Meanie!
Black Snooty, Black Snooty?
[muffled noises]
[prolonged gasp]
The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide.
[sing-song voice]
It was under E!
Whee!
Let's go!
Especially if there's candy apples in there.
What?
Those things are good.
[laughter]
[laughter]
Bleh.
Ooo!
[funny noises]
[laughter]
Oh girls, don't you see?
How are we gonna cross this?
Huh?
[sighs]
Now what?
Oh yeah.
One, two, three, four... There's only five!
Look at mine!
Look at mine!
Whoa!
[blows her nose]
[sobs]
Hey, you know what this calls for?
A party!
Isn't this exciting?
Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went [deep gasp]
but I mean really-
[crash]
Gah!
Bats!
Bats on my face!
Help!
Wait, these aren't... tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?
It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria!
I've always always always wanted to go!
With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and pinatas and pin-cushions.
With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla.
And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!
Oh thank you, Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever.
Yes, yes, yes!
Twilight's taking me to the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.
Him... Who?
But Twilight's taking me.
And then I said, Oatmeal, are you craz... oh.
Yes, Twilight?
Oh, you didn't know?
Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!
And me too.
It's no fun upsetting your friends.
And to celebrate.
Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me.
[laughter]
Hey... This makes my voice sound silly!
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen.
[eats popcorn]
Yee haw!
Ride 'em, cowpony!
Appletastic!
I know.
A party!
Not since the stampede.
This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me.
Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
Woo-ooo.
She seemed fine to me.
Woo!
Woo!
Yes siree bob, Mrs Cake.
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out.
Why, she's the best baker ever.
Right, Applejack?
Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.
All right-y!
I'll get the sugar and the eggs.
Can you get me some chocolate chips?
Chocolate chips.
Baking soda.
A cup of flour.
One last thing.
Wheat germ.
Now that's gonna be delicious.
Free muffin sample spectacular!
No, not baked goods, baked bads.
[groans]
Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away.
Where'd you get them?
Hoof-biting action overload!
She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down -swoosh- and right before she hit the ground -shoom- she pulled up - vrrrmmm!
And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!
Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash.
But, but Rainbow Dash?
But?
I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash.
Have you seen her?
Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash?
Okay, thanks anyway.
Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?
Rainbow Dash.
Hi again.
Pfeh.
I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.
I totally promise it'll be totally fun.
Over to the right.
No no, a little to the left.
Oh wait, back to the right.
Now a little leftish while staying rightly.
Stop.
Hmm.
Maybe a few inches to the south.
Now a couple centimeters north.
Okay.
One more smidgimeter to the... Uh, I mean, perfect.
Now wait for my signal.
Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups.
Oh no, you're not hurt are you?
Oh, okay, good.
Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?
[laughs]
Aah!
[hiccup]
[giggles]
[hiccup]
[chuckles]
[hiccup]
[laughs]
[hiccup]
Are you [hiccup]
kidding?
[hiccup]
I love to pull pranks.
It's all [hiccup] in good fun, and Pinkie Pie lo... [hiccup] ...oves to have [hiccup] fun!
[hiccup]
[hiccup]
[hiccup]
That'd be [hiccup] I'd really [hiccup] When do [hiccup] I mean [hiccup] When would you [hiccup]
Mmm-hmm.
I don't know.
This is gonna be gold.
Aaa-choo!
Is someone over there?
Who're we gonna squirt?
Who're we gonna squirt?
WHAT?
[spits]
Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive.
It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank.
Oh, [chuckles]
I've got someone in mind.
[chuckles]
The toughest around.
[giggles]
Oh, yes.
[giggles]
You're very close.
[blows party hooter]
Rise and shine Rainbow Dash!
It's a brand new day and we got a lot of pranking to... Ooh.
What's a griffon?
[laughs]
Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank.
Gilda, you game?
Um, well sure, no problem.
Have fun you guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you, later.
[blows party hooter very sadly]
Hey there.
It's later.
And I caught up.
Hey!
Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.
Wait, guys!
Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
Yeah?
[gasp]
Whaaa-aaa?
Hmph!
Um, yeah.
She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off.
I've never met a griffon this mean.
Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.
Hmm?
Jealous?
Improve my attitude?
But I... D... It's Gilda that... D... Are you seri... [scream of frustration]
Maybe Twilight is right.
Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants.
Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants.
[sigh]
[sips]
Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke.
How mean.
No, no, I can't misjudge her.
It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.
[gasp]
I did misjudge her.
She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief.
Nonononono, she might give it back.
It's just a joke.
She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully.
The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is.
I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that.
One.
This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style.
Welcome, welcome.
Welcome!
Welcome.
Welcome.
Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda.
Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
Gilda!
I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
[laughs]
Great.
[giggles]
Well, I hope so.
This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.
And I got my eye on you.
Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash.
Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
Please help yourself.
Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.
You do?
Cake time everypony.
Now, I wonder who could've done that.
Why?
Can't you watch me like a griffon?
Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first.
Let's get you blindfolded.
We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony.
Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
Wait.
The poster is this..
Uh, Gilda?
You pinned the tail on the wrong end.
Ooh.
I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.
I threw this party to improve your attitude.
I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
No hard feelings.
It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time.
Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish.
This calls for a celebration!
Ooo!
I'm going to need balloons!
One for every pony in Ponyville!
Let's see, that's one, two, three, four... Five, six... Seven.
Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!
He should really see a doctor.
That doesn't sound healthy at all.
[laughter]
Oh, I mean, grrr!
Ooo!
Pretty!
[imitating a dragon]
Welcome to my cave, Rarity.
Care for a diamond?
[roar]
Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!
Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it.
Flap those wings!
Whoo-hoo!
I win again!
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's just a hop, skip and a jump.
See?
Whoo-hoo!
Let's do it again!
[laugh]
Spike is a dragon.
You're not scared of him.
Exactly!
Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side!
Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh.
Or sharing.
[roar]
Psst!
Twilight!
Spike!
Come here!
Come!
Here!
Hurry!
Before she gets you!
Z-Zombie pony?
I'm not alone in the dark.
Glance evilly this way.
And spoooooky!
And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff!
She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!
It's a work in progress.
Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.
Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.
Just like in my song!
She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!
If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!
Then what will she do?
Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew!
Soooo... Watch out!
Ah pfurse!
Pee pah Zthecora!
Sthe put a cursthe on me!
Ah am-pft!
Pf-she's gone-pft!
Nopthe.
Plis place plooks horrible!
Sthe sthtole my sthong!
Shthe shtole mm mm!
Hmm... Pbth!
[whimper]
[incoherent]
You made me speak ridiculous!
Oh, my gosh!
I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk.
I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'!
It was the worst!
Don't you agree, Fluttershy?
Mmm... I know.
That's why I'm tasting them.
Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
No, not at all.
Come on in and make yourself at home.
[slurp]
What's going on, Fluttershy?
Ugh!
A parasprite?
Are you kidding?
Ugh.
Now I gotta go find a trombone.
A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Girls!
Hello!
This is important.
Durgh!
Thanks a lot.
Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica.
[plays harmonica]
Isn't that great?
[gasp]
And not a moment too soon.
And I'm not?
You know how many more instruments I've gotta find?
A lot, that's how many.
Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
You've got a real problem, all right.
And a banjo is the only answer!
Twilight, we don't have much time.
Exactly.
That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
[gasp]
You're right!
Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal.
Follow me.
I said, follow me!
And you are all so stubborn!
They will be with these cymbals.
[crash]
Hey!
Give me those back!
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
Ruin?
I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee!
Or is it ruiness?
Ruinette?
Hey!
I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof.
If you'd just slow down and listen to me!
Look, tambourines!
If you could all just... [scream]
[tambourines shake]
I'll save you!
Hey, what happened to the princess?
Oh no!
Have they got parasprites too?
Well, have tuba, will travel.
Well, duh!
Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments?
I tried to tell you.
Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
Hellooooooo, Twilight!
Wheeeeeeee!
Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie.
Just comes natural.
Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer.
I cut lines in the lakes with my skates.
That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
Ha, tell me about it.
Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?
Come on, put on those skates over there.
I bet you'll be a natural too.
Yaaaaay!
[cheers]
Yippie!
Twilight, steer!
Steer!
Oh boy...
[blips]
Twilight, you did a great job your first time around.
I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.
But did I make you feel better?
I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground.
I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.
Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
Eating cupcaaakes!
I don't have any cupcakes.
[gasp]
But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.
Oooh, those look much better than the last batch.
[chomp]
Mmm... What about that?
[blow]
Flour.
It's flour!
Yay!
I guessed it.
What game you wanna play next?
Please say bingo, please say bingo.
We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?
Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!
Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves!
This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.
As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall.
So get ready, ponies.
The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes.
Racers!
Please take your positions!
Hey, Spike!
What's up?
Oh wait, it's me!
I'm up!
[laughs]
What?
Spike!
Would you like to be my co-reporter?
We could comment on the action together.
Climb on up.
All right, ponies, are you ready?
And they're off!
Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves!
You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running.
No, that's left to my little ponies.
Ugh.
Those lazy, lazy leaves.
But this year, the run is about more than the weather.
It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
Yes, and grudge rhymes with fudge.
And I like fudge.
But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
Oh, no thanks.
I had a big breakfast.
Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck.
But what's this?
Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose.
But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead.
She's ahead by half a nose.
Or maybe three quarters of a nose.
No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking.
Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!
What an upset.
I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
She's the head of the pack, all right.
The pick of the litter!
The cat's pajamas!
Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs?
That's not very sporting of her.
Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.
I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest.
Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard.
How about you, Spike?
Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
Applejack, what are you doing up here?
I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!
But it isn't the running that's been fascinating.
It's the lack of running!
Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position.
Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack...
Oh yes, she di'id!
It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash...
For last!
I love something!
Something is my favorite!
Don't you think my gown would be more me with some lollipops?
Balloons?
Do it!
More balloons!
Oh no, that's too many balloons.
More candy!
Oh, less candy.
Oh wait, I know.
Streamers!
Whose dress is this?
Are you as happy with them as we are?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
I don't believe it!
Rarity?
You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
Give her time.
We all finished your dress for you.
We're so super sorry.
Ooh!
Hmm...
Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
It's my tail!
It's my tail!
It's a-twitch a-twitchin'!
And you know what that means!
The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling!
You two better duck for cover.
He just said nice catch in Frog.
Um... Twilight?
You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
Nah!
I could just see it.
La-la-la-la-la...
My tail!
My tail!
Twitch-a-twitch!
Twitch-a-twitch!
Somethin' else is gonna fall!
It's okay, my tail stopped twitching.
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la...
My ears are flopping!
My ears are flopping!
I'll start a bath for you.
Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things.
Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day.
And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.
No, but my shoulder's achy.
That means there's an alligator in the tub.
No, it's not, silly!
This is my pet alligator, Gummy.
He's got no teeth.
See?
Haha!
What's not to believe?
You do magic, what's the difference?
That's so not true, Twilight!
Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future.
I call 'em combos.
Sure!
You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter.
That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on.
Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!
Oh no-no-no-no-no.
You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter.
This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch.
That usually means look out for opening doors.
You okay?
You don't believe because you don't understand.
Okie-dokie-lokie!
Nopey-dopey!
Wait!
Hold on!
Uhh, no.
I don't control it, they just come and go.
Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...
It's my tummy!
That usually means I'm hungry!
Let's eat!
Okie-dokie-lokie.
[gasp]
Uh-oh.
[gasp]
Hu-bu-bu-bu-buh!
Uh-huh.
[sniff]
Mmm...
[gasp]
Hey, Applejack.
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing.
[giggles]
Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!
All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell?
Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy.
Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen!
Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu!
And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg!
Uh, I'm not sure.
Okie-dokie!
[shivers]
Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
No thanks, I'm fine.
[shivers]
Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Whoa!
What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!
Fluttershy?
[gasp]
I'm so glad everything's all right.
Is that a hydra?
[whimper]
Ooph!
[pant]
Oh, lookie there, it stopped.
O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
T-T-T-Twilight!
T-T-T-Twilight!
You have to jump!
You'll be fine!
It's your only ho-o-ope!
You have to take a leap of faith!
I knew you could do it, Twilight!
[shudders]
That wasn't it.
The hydra wasn't the doozy.
I'm still getting the shudders.
Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh!
You see?
There it is again.
Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.
Dunno, but it just wasn't it.
Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh!
Ooh!
[gasp]
That was it!
That's the doozy!
You believing!
I never expected that to happen!
That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was!
La-la-la-la-la...
Honk!
There it goes again.
You never know.
[grunt]
It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles!
Some are fast!
[makes car sounds]
And some are graceful.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ooh!
I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom!
It's like, the most coolest thing ever!
Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on!
It's a sonic rainboom!
How not cool could it possibly not be?
You really need to get out more.
The sonic rainboom is legendary!
When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... Boom!
A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
A flight spell?
One sec.
Page twenty-seven.
It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
Sure did!
Haha.
Pretty cool, huh?
[slurp]
[pants]
Spicyyyyyy!
[giggles]
We still love you.
Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.
[squeal]
Whoooaaa!
Wait for me!
Whee!
Whee!
Ha, ha, ha!
I can't believe you found all these gems!
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
[gasp]
We won't say a word!
Twilight!
You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything.
He trusts you.
And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
Forever!
How'd it go?
How'd it go?
Forever!
Forever!
[chomp]
Mmm... Juicy!
Uh, yes!
Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house on top of the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house on top of the hole.
[squee]
[sigh]
And you were doing so well.
No, are you asleep yet?
Oh yeah!
[giggle]
What tree?
You mean Bloomberg?
Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!
Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
She's not a tree, Dashie!
Oooh, looky!
Now they're doing tricks!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Now do a backflip!
... Or...
Just jump?
Boo!
Ah, ya caught me!
Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either!
You're good.
I do?
I am?
Oh my gosh!
So am I!
Mmm!
Before we finish eating?
Are you loco in the coco?
Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?
Well that's not very nice.
Right, Rainbow Dash?
Hi, guys!
We didn't!
Hey!
I've got an idea!
Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...
Wah-ahh!
Whoa-oo-oo-oo-ooa!
Hey!
That's what I said!
[giggles]
Whoo-hoo!
Cupcakes, candies and pies, oh my!
Oooh!
Chocolate fountainy goodness!
You gonna eat that?
Hey!
[gasp]
No, it's my fault!
Wait, what are we talking about?
You're looking for Rainbow Dash?
If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.
Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.
Hey!
I have an idea!
Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?
Cutie mark?
Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
All right!
My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville.
We spent our days working the fields.
There was no talking.
There was no smiling.
[sigh]
There were only rocks.
We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field, when all of a sudden...
I'd never felt joy like that before!
It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever!
And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often.
I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?
And that's how Equestria was made!
Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark.
It's a gem!
I heard that boom!
And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
We all owe our cutie marks to you!
I love you, guys!
Definitely!
Little Spikey-wikey!
Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
Mmm.
Wow!
These cookies are delish!
And now the punch has been... spiked!
Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend!
I'm... Hooked!
I swore I had one here somewhere.
Ah, here it is!
A quince!
Right.
A quail?
A quilt!
A quesadilla?
Aha!
A quiche!
Nope.
Sorry.
All outta quills.
[rasping voice]
Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations.
Hey, girls!
[squeal]
Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you could make it to Gummy's party.
It's just a boring old apple.
Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there.
I can't tell you that, silly.
Then it wouldn't be a surprise.
Nope!
Something new.
It's Gummy's favorite.
Ooh, this is my jam!
Having fun?
They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there!
C'mon, everypony!
Gummy wants to dance!
Go, Gummy!
It's your birthday!
Go, Gummy!
It's your birthday!
You sure you don't wanna stay?
There's still some cake left.
[gasp]
We should do this again soon!
It's soon!
You said we should have another party soon, and... it's soon!
Here's your invitation!
All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
Yes, indeedy!
I understand.
Your studies come first.
But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake.
And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books.
You should really just read them.
Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?
It's an invitation to Gummy's after-birthday party this afternoon.
There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
That's funny.
That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, Yes!
It's this afternoon!
Okey-dokey-lokey!
A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests.
Gummy's after-birthday party is this afternoon.
I'm delivering the invitations.
It's so strange.
Everypony keeps saying that.
I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party.
Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty.
Nope!
Huh...
No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity.
Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests.
Yes!
As in, this afternoon this afternoon!
[sigh]
Both of you?
Wait!
Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream.
Who're you house-sitting for?
Harry?
That's strange.
I know just about everypony around here.
A bear?
Wait!
There's a bear around here who lives in a house?
He's vacationing at the beach?
Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy.
Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too?
Rarity has to wash her hair?
Applejack has to pick apples?
Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books?
The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like... excuses!
That doesn't look like studying... or hitting!
But... we're friends.
What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about?
[gasp]
She's coming back.
Time to get to the bottom of things!
[gasp]
I think our cover's been blown!
We'll need a new disguise.
I thought everypony loved my parties.
Rainbow Dash!
Wait!
Where're you going?
What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?
What's in the bags?
I know you're IN THERE!
Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?
Rainbow Dash just went in there.
Okey... dokey... lokey.
Secrets and lies!
It's all secrets and lies with those ponies!
They're up to something, Gummy!
Something they don't want me to know about!
Well, I'm gonna know about it!
I'm gonna know about it big time!
And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it.
Tell me all about it big time!
It's all yours, Spike.
All you have to do is talk.
No, no, no.
Talk about our friends.
Grr!
You're not understanding me!
I want you to confess!
Confess!
And?
Aaand?
Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore!
Aha!
I knew it!
[balloon deflating noise]
Oh no, my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore.
[sigh]
Thank you all so much for coming!
It means so much to Gummy.
Well, of course you can have some more punch, Mr Turnip.
[twang]
Why, thank you, Rocky.
I'm so glad, Sir Lintsalot.
Anything for you, Madame le Flour.
Oh, they're not so bad.
Oh, c'mon now.
Losers might be a little strong, dont'cha think?
Well, it was pretty rude...
It was, wasn't it?
You know what?
I'm not gonna speak to them ever again.
And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live!
They don't deserve to be invited to my parties.
[plink]
Not after the way they've been acting.
Who could that be?
I know how it goes, all right!
No thanks.
I'm spending time with my real friends.
Isn't that right, Madame le Flour?
Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?
I most certainly am not.
I'm having a wonderful time right here.
I said no!
No... I... don't!
Excited?
Excited?
Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?
Yes!
You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate!
A Farewell to Pinkie Pie party!
Why?
Why?
Why?
Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!
[squeak]
Because it's my birthday!
Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?
And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
You girls are the best friends ever!
How could I have ever doubted you?
You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you?
His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it.
Ahh!
I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
What's Twilight doing?
An apple!
Are we having pie?
Ooh!
Busy having fun!
To whoop!
The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band...
Shiny!
Pretty!
Fancy!
[anxious noise]
Gotta dance!
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.
And I'm not going to...
[gasp]
C'mon, everypony!
I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!
Ohhhhhh... They don't want a party.
These ponies want a paaartay!
Come on, everypony!
You wanted a partay?
Now it's paaartaaay!
Yeah!
Now that's a beat, yeah!
C'mon, dance!
Yeah, woohoo!
Stage dive!
Ooh!
Rarity, your glass slipper!
Now your prince is sure to find you.
Laughing!
In fact, it's made it...
Why would you wanna stop this?
[slurp]
Hey, what happened?
You and me both, sister!
Hey!
Hey, look!
We're famous!
Hold on a second!
Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys.
Chocolate rain!
Oh, well.
If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.
He's standing on your head!
See you guys there!
Whee!
This is the greatest balloon garden I've ever seen!
It's the first balloon garden I've ever seen, but still!
Wah!
[splash]
Hey, what gives?
It's different.
They're laughing at me.
My friends laugh with me, not at me.
Stop it!
Stop laughing at me!
Happy?
I don't think so.
Oh you are, huh?
Why?
Need a good laugh?
[blows raspberry]
And what are you laughing at?
Why?
Need a good laugh?
And what are you laughing at!
Well, quit it!
You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink... ie Pie!
Quit it!
Quit it!
Quit it!
Stop it!
Chocolate milk?
I hate chocolate milk!
What 'chu laughin' at?
This may look like fun, but it's not.
I hate libraries!
I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
It's your fault it didn't work.
Any of you!
ALL OF YOU!
I'm outta here!
[laughter]
And I-I turned gray!
[giggle]
Can you believe it?
Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!
Oops.
Wait-wait-wait!
[slurp]
[growl]
[giggles]
Oh, Twilight, you're such a crack-up!
[laughs]
We're never gonna see Twilight again!
You can't punish her!
...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
[chicken squawk]
Enough chitchat!
Time is candy!
Too old for free candy?
[chicken squawk]
Never.
Yeah!
Great costume, Twilight!
You make a fantastic weirdo clown!
Twilight, Twilight!
Look at our haul!
Can you believe it?
And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies.
Didn't we, Pip?
And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and -?
[chicken squawk]
Everypony!
Just dump some candy and get out of here!
[gasp]
It's Nightmare Moon!
Run!
Did you hear that, everypony?
Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!
Fluttershy!
You've gotta hide us!
Nightmare Moon is here and...
[chicken squawk]
She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!
Hey, gals.
Anypony seen Pip?
We lost him the last time we had to run?
[chicken squawk]
Aaah!
Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak!
Everypony run!
[shriek]
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
[chicken squawk]
Nightmare Moon!
[chicken squawk]
Well, duh.
I know that.
Sheesh, Twilight.
I'm almost as big as her, how's she gonna gobble me up?
Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared!
No, I'm not.
I'm a chicken.
[chicken squawk]
A party will cheer you up!
Yesterday I told Mrs Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three!
Okay, six!
I ate six corn cakes!
[cries]
Make it stop!
Oh, make it stop!
[giggles]
We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.
Wait!
Look!
Ahh!
It's Rainbow Dash!
It's her!
It's Rainbow!
You got your perfect pet, right?
You did!
You did say that!
She did say that, that was the rule!
You may be right... silly.
[yelps]
Spike's a ghost!
I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense.
[twitches]
It's alright.
Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake.
[slurp]
[fades in]
Swoosh!
And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she?
Hi again!
Balloons are super easy to pack.
Isn't it fancy pants?
Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon!
Ta-da!
Let's party!
Mmm!
[blows party hooter]
Happy birthday!
Party time, woo-hoo!
Duh!
The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!
I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!
[screams]
Back!
Get back!
I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!
How dare you take the cake!
Somepony do something!
There it is!
Canterlot!
I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house... and it's me!
Twilight, let me handle this.
[shivers]
We're not hogging all the food, you are!
Oh, wait.
You're right.
It's us.
Well, it's only 'cause you mean old Pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!
Well, if you non-Earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas.
No, I'm first!
Maybe for you, Smart Cookie.
But I am a chancellor.
I was elected because I know how to think outside the box.
Which means [slightly echoes]
I can also think inside the chimney.
Can you think inside a chimney?
I didn't think so.
Ohmygosh.
Hold on to your hooves!
I am just about to be brilliant!
I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
Don't worry about them.
We're the ones with all the food, right?
Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food.
And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?
The point is...
Yes, yes.
This is definitely the right direction.
But that's impossible.
Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?
Of course!
How else could I see where I was going?
Or talk?
I need to be able to talk!
I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?
I got a newsflash for you, Cookie.
The Earth is round.
There is no up or down.
Relief?
You don't need relief!
If anypony needs relief around here, it's me!
I'm a chancellor!
I'm a bigshot!
You're just my, um... my, uh... Whatever.
You take the map, while I enjoy some relief.
The air!
The trees!
The dirt!
This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville.
Earth!
Congratulations to me for thinking of it.
I planted mine earlier than first.
Earth!
Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?
Uh... Smart Cookie!
Oh, look, you found my rock.
I've been looking for it everywhere.
Finders keepers, losers weepers!
Yeah!
Worse!
I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
Unicorns are snobs!
I wanna see the new baby pony!
I wanna see!
Which one is it?
Two new foals for me to play with?
[gasps]
That's two, two, two times the fun!
This is the greatest day ever!
We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today!
Woo-hoo!
But I was just?
But?
[quieter]
Happy happy birthday to you and you today?
Quick!
Make a wish and blow out your candles!
Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles!
You are zero years old, after all!
Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world?
Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am!
Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am!
Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am!
Here I am!
Here I am!
Here I am!
[blows raspberry]
Don't worry, they're fine!
[sniffs]
Oogh, I mean... Ah, no thanks.
I just had a big breakfast.
Oh, oh, you're making funny faces!
I have one!
Bleghhh!
All set now?
Everything good?
Okay, who wants to play again?
Except food.
No, you just fed them bottles, remember?
I could do it!
I wanna do it!
Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!
Pick me!
I'll do it!
Pick me!
I wanna babysit!
Pick me!
Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!
Ask me!
Mememememememememememememe!
[gasps]
I dunno.
I'll have to check my schedule.
I can be responsible.
Why, responsibility is my middle name.
Pinkie Responsibility Pie.
Yes, I know.
I will.
I am.
Whoa!
That's a lot of responsi?
Consider it done.
No problemo, Mr and Mrs Cake.
Everything is under control.
Uh-oh.
Oh, don't cry, little friends!
Look, look!
Where's Pinkie Pie... Where's Pinkie Pie?
Oh no... I'm right here, see?
[warbling noises]
Oh, think think think... Aha!
Hey guys, watch this!
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight!
Where y'all from?
Wow, that's great.
Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because... I couldn't find tractors that small!
Get it?
Tractors that small?
[pause]
The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him!
Gee, tough crowd.
Tell me about it.
Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!
There, see?
Nothing to this babysitting business!
Ugh!
Snack time.
That's easy enough.
Okie-dokie!
Eat up!
Like this!
Num-num-num, num-num-num-num!
Ahh!
No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths.
Huh, huh?
Uh, hey, guys, look at me!
Achoo!
Yeah.
I think I can see where this is going.
[snorts]
Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!
Drop it... Drop it... Drop it!
Ooh, look, guys!
Bubbles!
[blows]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry!
Look, look, uh, floating things!
Ooh, aaah, eeh!
Uh, don't make me do it, guys!
You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?
[sniffs]
[gasps]
[hoof on nose]
Smells like somepony needs me to changy-wangy their diaper-wiper right now-a-wow!
[tiptoeing noise]
Easy... easy... [sighs]
[growls]
Wait... no... stay there... just... for a second... stand still, I've almost... Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
Thank goodness they're home!
Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming!
I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like!
I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.
Ex-cuse me?
Is that so?
Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight.
Sorry, I don't have time to visit.
I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.
Well, of all the?
She thinks I can't handle things on my own!
Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own.
Well, I can handle things on my own!
Pound Cake.
[growls]
This is a crib.
It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort.
It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
And you, young filly.
We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!
Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap.
So, fall asleep!
[sighs]
[kisses twice]
Sleep tight.
Now that's what I call handling things.
[gasps]
Oh, nononono.
Not good, not good, not good!
Pound?
Pumpkin?
Where are you?
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Whoa!
You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!
Pound Cake?
[clicks]
Here, Pound Cake!
Uh, Pound Cake?
Uh... [squeals] You can fly?
Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt!
[gasps for breath]
I'm responsible for you!
No no no, Pumpkin.
No no.
Hmph!
I am the responsible one, and I said no.
That goes for you too, Pound Cake!
Gotcha!
I think?
Mm, razzleberry.
I'm- not- letting- go!
I'm- re-spon-si-ble!
Oh, not you too!
There!
Now who's the responsible one?
[yelps]
[giggles]
Y'know, you're right.
That is funny.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Shhh!
[gasps]
Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule!
I should be available a week from... never!
[happily gasps]
I have some free time next Tuesday.
Speech!
Speech!
Alright then, no speech!
And have fun.
And don't be nervous.
Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would!
And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy.
Taffy gives lots of nervous energy!
And drink sarsaparilla!
What?
It gives you extra sass.
Surprise!
Sorry!
I was just practicing my surprise!
for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria!
Surprise!
Don't worry, Twilight.
Got my lips all limbered up!
[makes various noises with her mouth]
Surprise!
Shoot!
[panicked sounds under]
I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
Ooh, pickles!
Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry!
Hurry it up in there!
Applejack!
I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!
I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!
Be right back.
Do you have any snacks?
That's it?
Well, that's a terrible story!
What?
She had beans?
Ugh, I told her I was snacky!
Hey, Applejack.
Need some help?
I promise.
Have you ever had a cherrychanga?
Ooh!
Sorry, that was a question.
Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself!
A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried.
Cherrychanga.
Great name, huh?
Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry.
Ooh, that's good too.
Which do you think sounds better?
Cherrychanga or chimicherry?
Or what if I combine them?
Chimicherrychanga!
What sounds the funniest?
I like funny words!
One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'!
I didn't make that one up.
I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day!
Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat!
And 'pickle barrel'!
Isn't that just the funnest thing to say?
Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel!
Say it with me!
Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!
Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'?
Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean...
Do you Pinkie promise?
Don't worry, Rainbow.
She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.
Good morning, Applejack.
You ready for br?
[gasps]
Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
Applejack!
You Pinkie promised!
Applejack, come back here!
She's gonna get away!
Follow that stagecoach!
Oh, we have you now!
Get them!
Get them!
Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise!
Apologize!
Wha?
Well, I... I...
Well I heard a sorry in there, so that'll have to do for now.
I'll get a real apology later.
Rarity, catch me.
What do you think, Rarity?
Chimicherry or cherrychanga?
Chimicherry, cherrychanga?
Chimicherry, cherrychanga?
Chimicherry, cherrychanga?
Chimicherry, cherrychanga?
[continues under]
[continues repeating question to fadeout]
Isn't this great?
I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's just a big old cider party!
Woo-hoo!
Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies.
Hope they don't run out before you get any.
She's right, y'know!
You can't rush perfection!
And this year's batch was perfection!
I'll never forget the cider I just drank!
It was a moment in time that will never exist again.
[sighs]
Nonpa-what?
Yessir, ma'am, sir!
Over there, Apple Bloom!
Don't miss them!
Rainbow Dash!
Isn't she the most daring devil?
I mean, the most devilish darer?
I mean?
Ooh, yeah, that's a good word.
She's dazzling!
Ai yi yi yi yi!
So much for dazzling.
Is her face gonna stay that way?
Ooh, just like a spider!
Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?
And look!
You have a roommate!
Yeah!
I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg!
It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange!
More like a grapefruit really...
Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh...
Hey, nopony invited me!
Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus.
Fracas!
Let's do this!
[wibbles tongue]
Happy!
Sad.
Happy!
Sad.
Happy!
Sad.
Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut, open, shut.
Yep, yep-yep-yep-yep-yep-yep.
Nope, nope-nope-nope-nope-nope-nope.
Oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooweooweoo!
[blows raspberry]
Nailed it!
Morning, DaisyJo!
You here to pick up some cookies to go with your milk?
Well, Mrs Cake just baked a fresh batch of your favorite oatmeal.
Oh, Rose, your Calla lilies look even better than last year!
I bet you'll take first prize at the flower show again.
Absolutely!
[chomps]
Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr Waddle, and you're wearing my favorite tie!
Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.
Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!
And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you... in one hundred and thirty two days!
'Cause everypony's my friend and I love to see my friends smile!
I've never seen you before.
Thanks!
I'm Pinkie Pie.
What's your name?
Property of C.
I'm guessing that last D is for Donkey.
Now, how 'bout that C?
Hmm...
Calvin?
Calhoun?
Caleb?
Carl?
Carmine?
Carlo?
Charlie?
Chester?
Chico?
Claudio?
Cletus?
Clifford?
Coraline?
Cornelius?
Cortez?
Crank?
Christopher?
And your middle name?
I'm sorry?
One more time...
[gasps]
So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?
C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!
What just happened?
Meet somepony new, check.
Introduce myself, check.
Sing random song outta nowhere, check.
Become instant best friends... uncheck.
I don't get it.
How can somepony not become instant best friends with me?
Was it something I said?
Was it something I sang?
This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie!
There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over!
'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'... Check!
Alright, Pinkie.
If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game!
Let's do this.
Howdy-doody, Cranky Doodle!
So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?
Well, I'd be happy to show you around.
It's the least a new friend can do.
Gosh!
I could never have too many friends!
But I don't need to go when I can stay and make friends... with you.
Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie.
All of my friends do.
Ooh, what does this bauble do?
Ooooooh, what's this?
Oooh, look at these!
Eeeheeeheee!
Okay, Cranky.
[gasps]
I promised not to touch your wagon, so I brought one of my own!
I use it to welcome folks!
Maybe we can be wagon buddies!
Well, you've gotta at least let me give you the special welcome that comes with it...
[whimper]
That's the spirit!
Wait for it!
Oh, silly me!
I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons!
Again!
[giggles]
[chomps]
Mmm, still delicious!
Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile.
Where's what?
[yelps]
Spider!
Big hairy spider!
Was that your wig?
I can fix this, I can fix this!
[through megaphone]
Hey, everypony!
Does anypony have a toupee?
This donkey is really, really, bald!
What's so funny?
This is serious business, everypony!
Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!
Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie.
Wait, Cranky!
Please, let me make it up to you!
Please!
Oh, please please please...
Ladies, this is a spa emergency.
Cranky needs help, STAT.
Hi, Cranky!
I have a gift for you!
It's not going to explode or anything.
Promise.
Just open it!
It's a new toupee!
I had my friend Rarity make it.
She calls it the dreamboat special.
He's starting to warm up, but still no smile.
Hmmm.
Hey!
Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?
Looks like a yard sale.
I'll give you two bits for this!
Well, why didn't you say so?
This is so pretty!
Where'd you get it?
Really?
What were you doin' there?
Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you.
See how good I am at it?
Like me?
Yes!
I'm in!
Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?
It's awfully pretty.
Huh?
I wonder where Cranky got this.
Huh.
Will you look at that?
Hey, Cranky!
Can I ask you about?
Oh no!
There!
Uh, all better?
I'm sorry, Cranky!
...It is?
Never, or never-ever?
That's four 'evers'.
That's like... forever!
I just can't believe it.
Cranky said he would never forever be my friend.
It was horrible.
No, no, it's okay, Twilight.
I get what you're saying.
What you're both saying.
And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone.
...Right after he accepts my apology!
Cranky!
Wait!
I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!
But do you accept my apology?
Oh, Cranky!
Please accept my apology!
Please!
But I'm really, really, really... really, really... really, really, really... really, really, really... really, really, really... really, really, really, really... sorry!
Cranky, please, please accept my apology!
I'd do anything to make it up to you!
Her?
Her who?
The special friend?
Cranky?
It's me again.
I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology...
Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book.
You didn't have to.
I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend!
And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday.
Nuh-uh!
My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!
And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala!
And I knew I recognized all these things.
And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
Matilda?
Nopony calls him Doodle.
So does this mean that you accept my apology?
[explodes like a firework]
Woo-hoo!
This is just fantastic!
Ooh, now we can hang out together and chat and sing songs and [gasps]
party!
Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party!
It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party!
...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.
Um, but we're still friends?
Great!
Dear Princess Celestia,
Whoops, privacy.
Sorry.
It's bigger than big.
It's double big.
You are a pony with a problem.
Right there!
That's the problem.
What do you think you're doing?
Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous.
One bit is the right price.
One bit.
One bit!
One bit!
Two bits!
Two bits!
I insist it's two bits or nothing!
Have it your way, one bit it is!
See?
Asserting yourself can be fun!
Don't give him your money!
One cherry is not worth twelve bits!
Who's next please?
And what can I get for you today?
Heyyy, look at you!
Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy.
Proud as pink punch.
Want some?
[giggles]
Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
New Fluttershy?
Old Fluttershy!
Nyaaaaah!
Too many Fluttershys to keep track of!
Make it stop!
Hey, leave her alone!
Fashion is her passion!
Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!
It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity!
We did?
Yeah!
He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty.
What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.
No, but he is.
Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now.
Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures.
Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?
But that's only half a day.
We need one full day at least.
A full day!
Full day!
Half day!
We need half a day and no more!
Okie-dokie.
See you tomorrow.
But we had an agreement!
You gotta come back tomorrow!
[screams]
[spits]
You were amazing, Fluttershy!
You totally stood up to that monster!
The one we missed!
C'mon, Fluttershy!
The party can't start until the party supplies get there!
Run for your liiiiiiiife!
Anypony else wanna panic with me?
Okay, everypony, follow my lead.
[screams]
Yes, Twilight?
I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency.
Come... Enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie...
For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny...
Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny?
I just got it.
Cool, huh?
Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all!
Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future...
I see... you, Twilight.
You will get a really cool birthday present next year...
That's it.
Yep.
Cool birthday present.
Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly.
It's only good for vague and immediate events.
Like that, see?
Where did that even come from?
Lalalalalalala, lalalala...
Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident.
Hope she still isn't mad.
Uhhhh... Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?
Are... you okay?
Sure!
Nice!
Makes sense to me!
Three hours?
But when did you sleep?
Yeah.
Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!
I have no idea!
Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency.
There!
Now you look like a pirate!
A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
Aren't we wearing them for fun?
Oh... Are you sure?
Awesome!
That sounds fun!
Aww.
I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
Cool!
Can we climb in the window again?
That was super fun!
Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
Twilight, the guard!
And that's bad, right?
Twilight, Twilight, I found something!
It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time.
It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments.
Does that help?
Woo-hoo!
Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
Ah, don't worry about it.
It's past Twilight's problem now.
Me neither neither.
Ahoy, maties!
Dragons ho!
And 'super-duper scary'!
Oh, not even close!
Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one.
Mayor Not Naturally Gray!
The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal?
Who wouldn't wanna read that?
What?
It's true!
I do have a problem!
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.
You've really outdone yourselves, Mr and Mrs Cake.
This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!
Absolutely!
It's my honor and I?
Alrighty then, Big Mac!
To the train depot!
That's it, Big Mac, nice and slow.
This is precious cargo you're carrying.
Don't worry, Mr and Mrs Cake.
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance?
I'll get it there safely, you'll see!
Twilight, can I see you a second?
A nice protective spell as extra insurance.
[laughs]
Better safe than sorry.
AJ, Rarity, one last thing?
All right, everypony, we're in the home stretch here.
See, Mr and Mrs Cake?
I got it here without a hitch!
Now all we have to do is get it...
[sigh]
Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
Well, the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.
All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue.
That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the MMMM.
Exactly.
It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize.
Hello.
What's your name?
The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
Wait!
Didn't you hear those chefs?
We have to protect MMMM.
Mmm-hmmm.
I know for super sure that MMMM is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too.
So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight!
You have to help me stand guard!
But they are!
I just know it.
I'll show them.
I'll stay up all night and protect you.
Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
Huh?
Stop, you saboteur!
I have you now!
Wha?
A-ha!
Ahh?
Thank Celestia you're okay!
But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what.
Huh?
Who turned out the moon?
Don't go near that cake, thief!
Stop, thief!
Oh, are you okay, thief?
[growls]
Huh... Overreacting, my hoof.
I knew I was going to have to keep a close eye on you, and that's just what I'm gonna do.
[snores]
[snores]
Huh?
What?
[gasp]
The cake!
Oh, MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous.
I know.
I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
Look at what?
Huh?
[gasp]
[screams]
It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been mutilated!
Now we just need to find out who done it.
Exactly.
Who did-done-dood it.
Exactly.
And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Yes!
And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight.
Because the obvious answer is... 'Cause I know who did it.
How could I possibly not know?
Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.
I guess you feared your eclairs lacked flair, Gustave!
Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.
What do you mean, lowly assistant?
Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.
Hm... You're right, my fine fellow.
Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the MMMM was destroyed by another baker.
A baker who's donuts are do-nots.
That's right, it was Joe!
Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.
Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant.
Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.
Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the MMMM.
Mulia Mild!
Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize.
Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.
[sigh]
I guess you're right...
But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the MMMM.
That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme.
I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia.
It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles.
And Gustave's eclairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness.
But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose.
[sighs]
why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness.
So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?
[gasp]
Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
Huh!
You're not accusing me, are you?
I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone.
Already?
I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine.
But when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.
Well... I went back to the dessert car.
The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud... and then they were gone!
When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.
That's it.
I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night.
I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
Exactly.
A-ha!
A blue feather!
I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!
No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!
So Rainbow Dash did it!
Case solved!
So it was you!
That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!
So you're wearing a wig?
You're goin' down, Fluttershy!
That's okay.
At least this mystery is finally solved.
You're right, Twilight.
You know what we have to do?
Look for clues!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
I most certainly did.
It was none other than... the bakers!
First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache!
And Joe has eclair in his hair!
And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!
I think we can fix that.
Come on!
Dear Princess Celestia,
How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?
I don't mind if I do.
Mmmmm.
Hip, hip, hooray!
[gasp]
Best wedding ever!
We're here, we're here!
Aaaaaaaaa?
[sneezes like a trumpet]
Okay, let me see.
We've been over the games... the dances...
[gasps]
I think this reception is gonna be perfect!
Don't you?
[gasps]
Thank you!
Do me!
Do me!
Meh, I've seen better.
[squee]
Let's get this party started!
Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?
Sparkleriffic!
Oh-oh-oh!
Lemme guess!
Is it Spike?
Nono, Fluttershy!
Rarity?
Time to gather some intel!
Because it isn't!
[screams]
A spy?
How did they know?
Must have noticed my night vision goggles.
Ooh!
Night vision-y!
My cover has been blown.
I repeat, my cover has been blown!
I like her!
[draws deep breath]
[blows flugelhorn]
Flugelhorn!
[takes deep breath]
[blows flugelhorn]
Flugelhorn!
[laughs nervously]
My bad.
Sparkleriffic!
I want a flugelhorn!
I want a flugelhorn!
[flugelhorn fanfare]
I sure hope that time comes soon!
Even I can't keep this party going forever!
[shrieks]
'Cause hugs are funneriffic, especially when you throw one around a friend.
Whatcha doin'?
Wheee!
[giggles]
What a cute orange birdie!
Do me next, Twilight!
Do me, do me!
Ooooh, Rarity, wanna see Twilight turn me into an orange?
It's gonna be funna-fun-fuuun!
[gasps]
This is terrible!
You had total-awesome-amazing fun and I missed out on it?
Neh!
Wait!
What if there's more awesome amazing fun with friends happening somewhere in Ponyville right now that I'm missing out on too?
Hey, Rainbow Dash, whatcha doing?
Oooh, fun!
Wheeeeee!
Gotta go!
Hey, Applejack!
That looks like fun, can I join you?
Wheee!
Next time I'll pull you!
Fluttershy!
There... you... are... Doing... anything... fun?
Oh, good.
Fun... is hard...
[sighs]
Abso-tutely-lutely!
Thanks for letting me rest in your butterfly grove while I get my Pinkie strength back!
That's just the thing!
I've got so many wonderful friends having fun in every last corner of Ponyville, I can't figure out how to keep up with it all!
It's driving me even more coco-loco than usual!
You are such a good friend.
This is perfect!
Everyone will now bring their fun to me.
Ha, this'll solve everything!
Why didn't I think of that?
I am so there.
Wheee.
And I'm also so there.
Whee, whee.
[gasps]
Choose?
Timing myself galloping back and forth between the swimming hole and Sweet Apple Acres.
I'm trying to cut down my time so if Rainbow Dash dives off the swing, I can get to Sweet Apple Acres to help with the barn raising, and then be back in time to see Rainbow Dash hit the water after doing a double flip!
[sigh]
If I can cut my time by only twenty minutes, I'm good.
That's it, Twilight!
The legend of the Mirror Pool!
Seems like hardly anypony's been here in ages.
I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right from my Nana Pinkie's story.
Where the brambles are thickest, there you will find a pond beyond the most twisted of vines!
[echoes]
What was that?
Oh, I heard a voice!
Hehe.
It was me.
Ouch!
Ooh!
Stop scratching me up, you brambles, and?
Whoooaaa!
[gasp]
The Mirror Pool!
[echoes]
Oh, and there's that voice again!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Ah Pinkie, you have got to stop talking to yourself.
Starting... now.
And into her own reflection she stared, uh, yearning for one whose reflection she shared, and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!
Wow, the legend is true.
It really worked!
Okay, wait.
I promised not talk to myself anymore.
I should say something to her.
Or... would that still be talking to myself?
Excuse me, me?
Can I have a word with you?
Uh, I mean, me?
Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun, but?
I did, over here!
Whoa, calm yourself, Pinkie, there's loads of fun to be had in Ponyville with my girls!
Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em.
...And then there's Rarity.
She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff!
I'm thinking she can make us all matching t-shirts that say 'Team Pinkie', and?
Uh, well, let's see, Applejack's having a barn raising at?
It's that-away!
Wait, come back!
Don't forget to meet me back here to tell me everything about everything, like I was there myself!
Because I'm you and, and you're me, and?
Oh, my gosh!
This is the greatest plan ever!
[squee]
Now, off to double my fun!
Let's rock this pool, ponies!
[blows up inflatable]
Whee!
Coming in, Dashie?
The water's great, it's totally wet and everything!
That's fine, you relax.
At least we'll still be together!
I did.
I have no idea.
Actually, I'm probably still on my way there now!
Whee!
So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once.
Gotcha.
I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly.
Wheeeee...
Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend.
Ooh, ooh, gotta run.
Looks like I'm trying to get my attention.
Excuse me.
Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it!
Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast?
Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range?
Ooh, did you get ice cream?
What kinds did they have?
Banana brickle?
Fluttershy.
Aw, how could you say no to that?
Applejack.
Aw, my poor poor me!
There, there.
Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies.
Easy peasy.
Come on, would I lie to me?
I think you mean a double-double me.
Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will.
Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else.
Perfect!
Okay, let's go!
[under]
Hey, Pinkies!
Yoo-hoo!
Okay, good enough.
Pinkie Pies, move it out?
What in the name of pink?
Knock it off!
To Ponyville, everyone!
Follow me!
[sighs]
Yes, it's fun there.
[whistles]
Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times.
An unprecedented and massive undertaking!
But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you!
Excellent.
Okay, let's get on with this, folks.
Fan out on three.
One?
Eh, good enough.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee!
Dash is gonna love this!
Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing!
Uh-oh...
Gosh, uh...
I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now!
Maybe I'd better go check!
Oh, phew!
Looks like I haven't missed a thing!
Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so maybe we should talk a little later?
Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?
My poor friends...
Twilight!
I have to talk to you, I need your help!
Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie!
Me either.
Ohh...
We've all got the same adorable tails, we've all got the same adorable manes, we've all got the same adorable hooves!
Which one of us is the real Pinkie?
I haven't the slightest clue!
And if I can't tell us apart... who can?
Heck if I know.
Could be any one of us if you ask me.
And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway.
So just leave me alone.
I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do.
[sighs]
I bet she misses you too.
Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again.
Hey.
Hey!
What if you gave them a test?
Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all!
Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond.
But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie!
This is great!
If I pass, I get to be with my friends again!
[gasps]
But what if I don't pass?
Oh, what if I'm not the real Pinkie Pie?
Ohhhh!
Stupid [thud]
magic [thud]
mirror [thud]
water!
This is all your fault!
...And mine.
[thud]
I passed?
I had to.
I just had to.
I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't.
But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them.
I'm me!
I'm me!
I'm me!
Or am I?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am.
Dear Princess Celestia,
You wanna know exactly what I feel like doing right now?
[sighs]
[snores]
[laughs]
Funny joke!
Ohhh!
Here!
Veggie salad!
Veggie salad!
[sighs]
Veggie salad.
Hey!
Don't leave me!
[laughs]
Leaf me!
[laughs]
Come on, Applejack.
We've got to get her in a nice, soothing pink, stat!
Hey!
You're lucky a rock farm would take the likes of you!
[indignant muffled noises]
[muffled noises]
[muffled noises]
[plays one-pony band]
[continues playing one-pony band]
[angry muffled yells]
[inhales]
Ooooh, I wish the mailpony would just come already!
I can't wait another minute to find out if Rainbow Dash got in or not!
IF you get in!
If you get in!
Don't jinx it!
Don't jinx it!
[gasp]
I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you!
[squeals]
Okay.
I'm done!
DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!
Do you think she heard me?
New spells, huh?
Okay.
Wait!
If I'm not here when Rainbow Dash's letter arrives, I won't be able to read it right away.
And if I don't read it right away, I won't be able to write her back right away.
And if I don't write her back right away, she might think I didn't get her letter, and then she might worry it got lost.
And if she's worrying about her letter, she'll be distracted.
And if she's distracted, then she won't do well at the academy!
And if she doesn't do well at the academy, then she'll get kicked out!
And if she gets kicked out, they'll never let her be a Wonderbolt!
And if she doesn't get to be a Wonderbolt, all her dreams will be crushed!
And it will be all... my... fault!
[thud]
Yep!
[snore]
[gasp]
Help me?
The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash!
It's been three days already.
By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore!
She probably can't remember our faces!
Pinkie Pie?
I never heard of a Pinkie Pie!
Who is Pinkie Pie?
Of course!
That's a great idea!
Oh wait!
I got an even better idea!
How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package?
You know, before she forgets all about us?
Although, come on, let's face it.
It's probably too late for that.
But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow.
A care package it is!
We'll send it through the mail!
WAIT!
That won't work at all!
Because what if the package gets lost in the mail?
What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend?
And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them!
I've got it!
We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person!
Me five!
But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first.
It may take a while for her to get her memory back.
You... remember me!
Wait!
You didn't even get to open your care package!
[belches]
Don't forget the glitter!
And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets!
I'll wear this mustache.
Can I still wear the mustache?
Just one question.
[sighs]
Suit yourself.
[screams]
I love it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville!
I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion.
Ya like?
And making yummy delicious chocolate milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to go with it anywhere in sight!
Not a single dollop!
[gasps]
Make that bunny cute again!
Now!
You bet!
Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are!
Yes you are!
Yes you are!
[gasps]
Ask me, ask me!
Of course you can have another cupcake!
Mm-hm?
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so?
I'll get you a bigger pond immediately.
He's always wanted a pair of riding pants?
His toenails need a new coat of shellac?
He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once?
[giggles]
Who wouldn't?
Spike time is the best!
No, no no no.
I love you more.
No, I love you more!
I love you more!
NOOOOOOOOOOO!
What?
I was just answering Twilight's question.
[through megaphone]
Okay, everypony, great job!
Sounds like we're ready.
Wow!
The Crystal Empire looks crystallier than ever!
Woo-hoo!
Ahh, so relaxing!
Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!
Put the pudding out to thaw before you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?
Our first stop is the castle, where we got a big razzamatazzy welcome planned for you!
Oooh!
Lemme give the tour!
I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!
So, you see this here?
This, um, this is, um... a big, round room.
It's known for its roundness and bigness.
And did I mention that it's round?
[blows raspberry]
Whatever.
Round is round, am I right?
Hey!
Look at me!
[makes funny noises]
Boingy, boingy, boingy!
[wibbles tongue]
NOOOOOOOOOOO!
I mean, YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!
Well... except for the spa.
What's the point of checking there?
That's where Cadance is.
If Ms Harshwhinny is there, well, then, game over, right?
Cinnamon bun?
[squee]
Come on ponies, I wanna see you SMILE!
Alicorn party!
[blows party kazoo]
Hold on a second!
[drinks]
[spits]
Best coronation day ever!
Wow!
That was a big finish!
Most of my dreams are about frosting!
[slurp]
Ohohohoho... Creamy, creamy frosting...
[chuckles]
We're gonna write you and give you so many details, it'll be like you're in Ponyville with us!
Right, girls?
Whee!
[in the distance]
That's me!
I dunno if you've noticed, but the Everfree Forest is just a teeny-tiny bit out of control.
A-boo-yah!
I haven't found squat in any of the books I've been looking through!
Oopsies!
Missed a spot!
Drop the act, buster!
We're onto you!
Oooh!
Ooh!
And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!
Whoa!
Oof!
Ugh!
Take the stairs, silly!
[blows party horn]
Yoo-hoo!
Come and get me!
Ta-da!
This is the most daring dare anypony ever dared dare another pony to dare!
It's exciting!
Rainbow Dash and Applejack are competing for the title of Most Daring Pony!
This is the final test: the Bee Stare!
Last pony to blink wins!
Don't worry, ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day!
Hmm, move the decimal, carry the 2, and...
Congratulations!
You're tied!
I dunno!
Numbers don't lie!
I'd love to stay and keep keeping score, but I promised to help test the new school bell.
I get to ring it all week, nonstop!
And I don't even have to take turns, because no one else volunteered!
[giggles]
Hey, you guys!
Did you know I can totally play the organ?
Because I didn't!
Check it out!
[continues playing light melody]
The pony of what?
Oh, yeah!
I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes!
They said that was good enough!
Eh, can't imagine why...
So then, I decided to throw a finish ringing the school bell party!
But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a finish ringing the school bell party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly.
I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity.
But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party.
Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party!
Uh, the everypony come to the scary old castle and hide from each other while I play the organ party?
[plays note]
Duh!
I always let my imagination run away from me!
Then it comes back... with cake!
Me three!
Because that means you two are still tied for Most Daring Pony!
[blows party horn]
We're having a holiday party!
[blows horn]
National Random Holiday Party Day!
Woo-hoo!
You might say the secret ingredient is... a secret!
[squee]
Hmm...
Maybe... or maybe AK Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob!
You should tell that to those guys.
Wow!
So much action!
Whee!
You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point.
Where's the Rainbow Dash who would help anypony at the drop of a hat?
A little more to the left!
No, the other left!
Awesome!
That's perfect right where it is!
On to the next painting!
We have everything under control!
Don't worry about it, Spike!
It's all good!
Pony power!
Weehee!
Weehee!
Wheeeeeeee!
[yelps]
Whoa!
[giggles]
That was spin-tastic!
Ooh!
Nice catchphrase!
[giggles]
Tag you're it!
Tag you're it!
Tag you're it!
Tag you're it!
Cupcakes?
Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away!
Fruit bat round-up, fruit bat round-up!
[giggles]
I got it.
Something suspicious...
Whatcha doin'?
What was that?
[gasps]
Suspicious!
[giggles]
It's pony signal time!
Suspicious!
Fluttershy?
Yoo-hoo!
Fluttershy!
Flutterbat on the loose!
Run for your lives!
She's just biding her time!
Waiting for the right moment to pounce!
But maybe vampire ponies eat other ponies!
I'm not taking any chances!
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's save Fluttershy before that thing eats us all!
Follow that bat!
Aww, if only we had Fluttershy to do her Stare on the Flutterbat.
You turned into a vampire pony!
Of course not!
Yes!
Yes, you were!
Yes!
[fake accent]
Stand back!
I vant to suck its juuuice!
[squee]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know!
A paper fan!
A magic trick!
You know, where I pick a card and remember what it is and then you put it back in the deck so you can't look at it and?
This trip is fun already!
I love jumping up and down!
Whee-hee!
Oh, that's funny.
Because that clock over there makes it seem like that's only ten minutes from now!
Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern!
You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right?
[squee]
Whatcha doin'?
Aaagh yourself!
But that doesn't answer my question, silly.
[giggles]
Ohhh.
I don't know what that is.
Ooh, fascinating.
Uh-huh... Interesting... I see... Hmm, that makes sense... Not much of a surprise there... WHAT?
This is the most amazing thing ever!
Why didn't you tell me how amazing this is?
Genealogy is better than cotton candy on top of a fountain of chocolate!
[thud]
You'll never believe who it says I'm related to!
Hey, cousin!
I know!
Isn't it the best?
Well, you actually have a fourth cousin twice removed by a fifth cousin, but that's like exactly like a sister!
Who knew?
[sniffs]
I was already super happy as a Pie!
And now I get to be a part of this amazing family too?
Best family twirl everrrrrrr!
It's riiiiiiiii- [inhales]
-iiiiiight here!
Uh-huh.
Applesauce of the Apple family lineage is a fourth cousin twice removed of the Pie family!
I guess it is a little smudged, but I see most of it there, and when I read it, I knew in my heart it was true!
Are y'all ready to go?
Because I'm ready to go-go-go!
[gasps]
I have the best... idea... ever!
Family river trip!
Woo-hoo!
Wait a second!
This one is for the scrapbook!
Applejack, when you're family, you make the time.
Say 'soaked'!
So what you're saying is, if I have the courage to jump, the parachute will open.
Whoa!
That is deep!
Say 'best siblings ever'!
Ooh, that's another keeper!
Ooh, sounds scary.
Tell us more!
[squee]
Got it!
Best scary unidentifiable creature ever!
Say 'terrified'!
[hums]
Best granny wisdom ever!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Is it?
Hmmmmmmm?
I just wanna say... that I think you're all super duper, and I can't wait to make a page in my scrapbook about the amazing waterfall we went down!
Wheeeee!
[yelps]
We're here!
We're here!
We made it to Goldie Delicious's's's's's!
You guys!
There's a note!
[giggles]
Oh, right, sorry!
I haven't even read it yet.
I was just looking at how pretty the paper is.
Okay, it says that she ran off to run some errands but will be home soon!
Oh, that's perfect!
Because it'll give me enough time to get more scrapbook paper!
See ya!
Are you kidding me?
You guys are the best family ever!
Yeah!
Now look at you!
You're all here still in one big unit, loving each other and owning up to what went wrong!
You never gave up, even when things got tough!
You aren't just family, you're best friends!
And I wanna be an Apple more than ever!
Yippee!
[giggles]
Hello!
We're Apples!
Am I not an Apple after all?
Don't be sorry, it's okay.
I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know for sure if I'm a part of this family.
What do you mean?
You can't know!
Ooh!
Say 'best family hug ever'!
Look at me!
I'm part of the Apple family too!
I'm arguing!
Argue, argue, argue!
Bicker, bicker!
[laughs]
Gimme a 'P' for 'Ponyville'!
[through megaphone]
P, Ponyville!
'P' is for 'perfect'!
'P' is for, uhh... 'pain'?
'P' is for 'proud'!
We're gonna be the best fans anypony has ever seen!
I can't wait!
Hooray!
[blows party hooter]
[gasps]
Where can I get pompoms like those?
[growls]
If I get my hooves on that [matching unintelligible gibberish]
, it'll be in big trouble!
Gah!
What am I gonna do with all these now?
Woo-hoo!
Go, Rainbow Dash!
Woo-hoo!
I just got the most incredible mail anypony's ever received in all of recorded pony postal history!
It's a flyer about a one-day sale on used patio furniture!
Aah!
Could this day get any better?
Woo-hoo!
Fluttershy!
I'll never forget youuuuuuu!
Ooh, something floaty!
La-la-la-la-la!
Oh, why wouldn't it?
[sighs]
Two sisters-in-law bonding.
Well, I for one am gonna make sure that nothing spoils their day!
Rarity, that doesn't look anything like a duck!
You and Fluttershy write each other letters?
Don't you worry, Discord!
I'll give you cuddles, and read you stories, and tell you all about me!
I was born on a Tuesday-
Well, as a matter of fact, I most certainly- Hey!
Who keeps throwing away these perfectly good balloons?
Great, thanks!
Got any streamers today?
Don't you know it!
Thanks, I guess?
I'm gonna need the full rainbow!
Yes, if you please!
Your biggest banner!
This party's gonna be the best!
Ooh, I am so, so, SO excited because today I'm planning the birthday bash of... Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash.
You realize that, by enlisting me as your party planner, I guarantee that this is going to be the funnest, most fantabulous, superbial party in Ponyville?
No guesses!
Parties are no picnic.
[growls]
Parties.
Are.
Serious!
And you have my certified Pinkie Party Promise that you will have the best birthday party ever!
Great!
Now, who's ready to join this super duper party pony to plan this super duper pa-rty?
Who are you, stranger?
What an amazing coincidence!
I'm Pinkie Pie, and I'm planning a party!
A cheesy sense?
Double amazing!
I have a Pinkie Sense!
A pair of party pony planners in Ponyville?
What can be more perfect?
Oh, I think we can do it!
Me too!
Like me!
As if!
Uh-huh!
You know it!
And me!
Uh, Pinkie?
Uh, n-none taken.
[squee]
That's okay.
[chuckles nervously]
He obviously has what it takes to do it all by himself.
Heh.
Yes, indeedy!
[chuckles nervously]
After all, if Cheese really is the super duperiest partying-est pony of them all, maybe that means... I'm... not.
That's it!
This pony has gotta get her title back!
And I know just what to do!
Freeze, Cheese!
I challenge you... to a goof off!
Oh, I don't think so.
I know so!
And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich.
Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash!
Doesn't!
So, are you in, Cheese?
Or are you... boneless?
Then the goof off is on for high noon!
Oh, well then.
Make it 3:10 to goof off!
[blows party horn]
I was born ready!
That's my song!
THAT'S IT!
[gasps]
Rainbow's not having the best party ever!
I... I broke the Pinkie Party Promise!
Stop!
The goof off is off!
You don't have to.
I forfeit.
Which means... Cheese Sandwich wins.
Yes.
You get to headline Rainbow Dash's party.
I... [sniffles] I don't.
I'm sorry I let my pride get in the way of you having the best birth-iversary ever.
Cheese Sandwich really is a super duper party planner, and he'll be a terrific headliner.
I should've been a big enough pony to admit that and let you have your day.
Why me?
Hah, really?
So I was the pony that threw the awesomely spectacular party that inspired you to become an awesome spectacular party thrower?
Yeah!
...and anniversary...
You're giving me your special rubber chicken friend?
I never did get that pony's name.
[giggles]
Oh, yeah!
I can!
I mean, finding out who the Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies is is a pretty big deal!
I'm glad the committee didn't automatically pick me so everypony gets a chance to see how great being me actually is!
Even though the festival's basically a party and the pony of ceremonies gets to organize the whole thing!
So it'd totally make sense if they did pick me.
[long inhalation]
I'm so excited for the festival, I can hardly stand up straight!
Are you kidding?
I can't wait!
Wow!
Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?
With ice cream on top!
Yeah!
It'll be so amazing!
You'll be there on stage, basking in the hooflights!
The center of attention!
A shining star!
Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you!
Why wasn't it them?
Why wasn't it them?
And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again!
Aw, but I'm so good at it!
[gasps]
Is it contagious?
Lost his voice and the title!
[gobbles]
Fluttershy, you were on the wrong side of the curtain!
You totally missed the show!
That was totally unbelievable!
I mean, the curtain came up and there you were, singing in front of everypony!
And you know, I don't think anypony was jealous, 'cause there certainly wasn't an angry mob!
But it must have been horrible standing there on stage, all eyes glued directly on you!
It's like you were living your own personal worst nightmare!
What?
Too much?
Wait!
Didn't I say that?
Whoops.
You were great!
Though, no offense... you kind of sounded like a dude.
Uh, a great-sounding dude!
Are you kidding me?
Only one?
The screaming fans?
And you didn't look completely petrified by the fact that we're all staring at you at all!
Twilight!
Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half!
Totally!
Hey, what's going on out there?
Oh, never mind, they're gone.
They're back!
Never mind, they're gone.
La la-la la-la... Yes!
Ooh, it's so exciting!
I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close!
I love cheers!
So... cute!
Can't... take... May explode!
That was amazing!
I love new ideas that make me feel funny at first!
[giggles]
So... stinkin'... cute!
Thank goodness you're all here!
There's no time to lose!
Careful!
My sister Maud's gonna be here soon, and I need your help taste-testing my rock candy recipes!
I may have gone a teensy bit overboard.
[squee]
Everypony ready for more?
Oh, but you've only tried half of the flavors, and we have to choose the perfect ones before she gets here so I have time to make more!
[chomps]
Aw, it's not just for Maud, silly.
I'm making candy for all of us!
It's part of a very important, super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share.
We're going to make rock candy necklaces together!
[squeals]
It all started when Maud and I were fillies on the rock farm.
She taught me the Pie family rock candy recipe!
It adds a secret ingredient... It's rocks!
And she showed me how to string the pieces to make them into a necklace!
And once we were done, we'd trade!
Maud and I have been trading necklaces back and forth since I moved to Ponyville.
They're a sign that we'll always be best friends!
[squee]
Yeah.
But these are a special kind of rock that Maud discovered.
Can't tell ya that, silly!
It's a secret!
Now that Maud is heading out to get her rocktorate in rock science, this may be our last chance to trade them for a really long time.
I can't wait for you all to meet her.
I just know that my best Ponyville friends and my best sister friend are gonna become bestest friends!
We can make bestest-est friend rock candy necklaces together!
She expresses herself through fashion just like Rarity, and she's really smart and loves reading just like Twilight!
And she's honest, and loves forest things, and is good at games, and... Well, oh, she's awesome!
She sure will.
[gasp]
I gotta get out of here!
We're heeeere!
She's coming!
She's not quite as fast as me.
I asked Gummy to stay with her in case she got lost!
We're over here, Maud!
This is going to be the best, most awesome, funnest week ever!
I can't wait for us all to become bestest friends!
[chews]
[with mouth full]
Maud's right!
They are crunchy!
Yum!
Is this him?
Is this him?
Is this him?
Is this him?
Where was he?
Maud and I had better get going too.
I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our best friends necklaces!
Aw, yeah!
Choices, choices, choices!
Rarity and my sister working together to design something amazing!
This is the best day ever!
Doesn't Maud make the coolest scarves?
What's he saying?
I wish I could speak hummingbird.
Humm!
Hum-m-m-m-m, hum!
Thanks again, Fluttershy!
Start thinking about which flavors you want to put on your best friend rock candy necklace!
Maud is a total bookworm.
She loves poetry!
She's so prolific!
[sniffs]
Can we taste it now?
[glugs]
Wow!
That's the best apple cider I've ever had!
Told you she was super honest, just like you!
That was amazing!
Great, you're all here!
Maud is out looking for rocks, so this is the perfect time for us to set up everything we'll need to make our best friend rock candy necklaces!
What's wrong?
Why not?
But what?
[mane deflates]
Okay.
If anypony needs me, I'll be in here trying to figure out what to do with two hundred pounds of rock candy.
I've come up with just the thing to bring everypony closer together!
I call it Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud Fun Time!
[squee]
It combines everypony's interests into one giant activity that we can all enjoy together and that will totally bring all of my bestest friends together as bestestest friends!
You'll need these.
Probably better for me to show you.
Watch this!
Applesauce tunnel for Applejack, pretty shiny stuff for Rarity, reading material for Twilight, critter time for Fluttershy... Cupcakes for yours truly... and it's a race for Rainbow Dash!
A rock slide, of course!
For Maud!
First you climb, then you slide!
Huh?
Huh?
[shrieks]
Help!
I guess I wasn't.
But... we never even got to make our rock candy necklaces...
Wait, Maud!
I'll come with you!
Me too.
I'm sorry I put so much pressure on everypony to bond.
I only wanted my friends to get to know my amazing older sister.
What are you doing here?
Aw, shucks!
What's wrong?
Are you kidding me?
I've never seen her more excited in my entire life!
Try not to eat all the candy before you leave!
Mmm!
Awesome!
I give it three woohoo's!
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo!
And an extra woo for good measure!
Woo!
Whoa your woes there, woeful.
Some ponies learn through theatrical presentation, but other ponies learn through musical intervention.
So, d'you get it?
That... was pretty terrible.
I dunno.
I bet General Flash rocked these thangs!
Of course I'm real!
I mean I'm not the real General Flash, the tenth leader of the Wonderbolts, but I, Pinkie, am really real.
Look at me!
Hmm, I'm intrigued.
Yeah, let's party!
I'm General Firefly!
Gee, my costume is itchy and unattractive, but I'm gonna assemble an awesome flying team!
I'll call them... the Wonderbolts!
[squeals]
Yes!
Best day ever!
We're all going to the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange!
And not just going... we're accompanying a princess on an official royal duty!
Um, shouldn't your princessness be headed to the royal box seats?
Mm-hm!
Stop!
What are you doing?
For that?
Do you reaaaaally want that?
Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh!
I can't believe that almost happened!
But luckily, it didn't happen, thanks to me.
According to the rules of the Exchange, a trade is only fair if both ponies end up with something they want.
You can't break the rules!
Did anypony see you do it?
I don't think anypony saw!
But you're not gonna say anything, are you?
Haha, I'm just kidding!
Or am I?
Sometimes I can't even tell!
[laughs]
Nope, I just came to pony-watch!
I'm not going anywhere.
I won't let you make a mistake like that again!
Hey, everypony, step right up!
Do not walk!
Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise!
These books made Twilight the princess she is.
Before that, she was nothing... a big, fat zero!
Then she read these books, and voila!
Princess!
So who wants to start the bidding?
I know you're not better than everypony!
Just leave this to me!
Did I mention that Princess Twilight got these books from Princess Celestia?
Oh, that's right!
Double princess!
Who's got something valuable enough to trade for Princess Twilight's princess books that she got from Princess Celestia?
Did I say princess?
Oh, come on!
These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn!
Ooh, now that looks fun?
but not fun enough!
These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is!
So who's got what it takes to trade for them?
Wait, stop, come back!
Uh, these books aren't that great...
[giggles nervously]
But I thought you wanted to get rid of them!
I told you I'd take care of everything!
[in distance]
Woo-hoo!
Hey, where's your double-doggie?
Hear ye, hear ye!
The Ponyville Foal and Filly Fair is almost ready to begin!
Whee, ha-ha, whoa!
Happy, happy day to?
huh?
Oh, no!
We can't be late for that!
[swallows]
If Ponyville medals here, we'll have eight medals so far, putting us tied for the lead with Cloudsdale!
Unless Cloudsdale medals here too...
Nailed it!
That's okay.
Ponyville has thirty seven medals, and Cloudsdale thirty six, so looks like we'll be medal champs of the Games anyway!
Woo-hoo!
So you're saying that it all comes down to this one event?
Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh!
Twilight!
Come take this extra seat next to me and freak out over the medal count!
I'll show you how: Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh!
You can have his extra seat, though.
Uh... Twi?
We did it!
Ponyville won the medal count, and only by one medal!
Why the looooooooong face?
Wait a minute!
How do you know how she was feeling?
Ooh, my turn, my turn!
Come on, Boneless!
Give us that key!
Wowee!
Hi, Mom and Dad!
[giggles]
Well, I was planning on organizing my baking sheets, but okay!
Stay behind me, everypony!
I'm on it!
[grunts]
I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit.
I know smiles.
And those smiles?
They're just not right.
Those smiles are bad news.
I've got my eye on them.
Something's rotten in... whatever the name of this village is that we're in right now!
Technically, it's a Tree-chest-castle-map!
Don't believe their smiles, Fluttershy.
If we were at the end of Equestria, we'd be sitting on a big 'A'!
[giggles]
Get it?
Are you crazy?
We'd never let a disagreement get in the way of food!
Make that twelve!
What?
I'm hungry!
Blech!
Mmmm... good...
Why me?
I've accidentally eaten cardboard tastier than that...
Pilgrimaging?
Oh, some ponies were telling us how much they missed their cutie marks, and?
Oops...
Hey, this is pretty good!
I don't know!
Maybe it'll be super fun to be all the same!
Sort of.
More pleasant than fun, I guess...
Of course!
Eventually the wind and the weather will wear down the walls until they start to crumble!
Then all we have to do is wait for a big enough hole to form and we can just walk out!
It's the perfect plan!
I guess.
Woo-hoo!
I mean, cool.
Laughs don't come in barrels.
They come from inside you as your body's response to delight.
These are amazing!
Now those are real smiles.
This feels like an ending!
It doesn't have to be an ending yet, right?
'Cause that Sugar Belle can bake!
[slurps, gulps]
Thanks!
Twilight spent all night helping me pick the flavor!
I kept thinking we'd found the right one, but she insisted I make even more to try.
And more.
And more and more and more and more!
It was like she never wanted to?
Exactly!
[chomp]
Eventually we ran out of time so we just went with every-berry-any-chip-surprise!
The surprise is I lost a measuring spoon in the batter.
Somepony's gonna get a very special pancake!
[coughs]
I win!
Yeah, this place has everything!
Big tall ceilings that make you feel tiny!
Shiny new floors that are cold to the touch!
Brrr!
And it even has loooong empty hallways!
Okay, I get it.
Together.
No one said anything about my hidden confetti cannons!
[squee]
Oh, right!
They're hidden!
[giggles]
What are you guys talking about?
I think it looks super fun!
Whee!
Okay, now it's a mess.
Fluttershy, tell your birds to stop pecking at my balloons!
But we can't get rid of the cannons!
I don't remember where I hid them.
Wow, Fluttershy!
I didn't know you could be loud enough to echo!
What do we do?
What do we do?
If Twilight comes home now, she'll be like What did you guys do?
And we'll have to be like Nothing!
And then she'll be like I was counting on you!
Some friends you are!
And we'll be like... [screams]
Remember the time it got blown up to smithereens?
Wait, no, that was the worst.
That one shows your party at the Golden Oak Library welcoming you to Ponyville!
Then let's start right now with a new memory cake!
Seven layer what's-that-flavor mystery surprise!
These might be chocolate chips or they might be super-spicy black beans!
What?
It's not my fault I hid them so well!
[gives rooster crow]
Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibern?
Which one?
Snuggly?
Wuggly?
Tankie?
Hibernate?
I was just saying how cute he?
Shhhh!
Don't say that word!
That's what started this all!
Knock, knock!
I hate to say this, but, well... you've become... A party pooper!
It's just heart-wrenching!
I'm mostly sad because you're not sad!
Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight!
You think we could mess up winter every year?
It's way less work!
Ooh, you're using the word!
Oh, she's using the word!
And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever!
Or wait.
Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party?
Or a 'happy wake-up' party?
Maybe an 'it's about time!
' party!
Have a good sleep, Tank!
Have a wonderful, special, fantastic day!
Oh, hi, Discord.
Want some cake?
I can give you a list of all the flavors we have in order of most delicious to incredibly, unbelievably delicious!
All of them?
He wants all of the cakes!
Oh, of course!
I was gonna ask my mom, because she's, you know, my mom, but it turned out she didn't want to go, so I started asking around and around and around, and I couldn't think of anypony, and I was about to just go by myself, and I realized, of course!
Who loves fancy exciting affairs more than anypony else?
My sister Maud!
You want none of the cakes now?
Maud!
Jokes!
Good one, Maud!
Hey, it's not a party until somepony spreads magic-resistant ooze uncontrollably over the ballroom!
[squee]
Come on, Smoozinator!
Let's dance!
La, la-la, la-la!
La, la-la, la-la, la la-la la-la!
This is gonna be so great, Gummy!
We have absolutely nothing to do today except bake!
I've been waiting for just the right time to finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer marjolaine recipe!
It's gonna be amazing!
Let's see.
Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream...
An hour per layer... that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss!
Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer!
Oh, my gosh!
My cutie mark!
[gasps]
You know what this means?
The map!
Uh, Gummy?
Could you take over for a bit?
Hopefully this'll be quick.
I'll just measure the baking powder for you... and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it.
And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue!
I know you can do this, Gummy!
You're the best alligator baker I've ever met!
[kisses]
She was a bit of a party pooper.
Huh?
Just me and Rainbow Dash?
Why don't you just come with us?
I mean, you are the Princess of Friendship.
Well then, come on, Dashie!
We're going to Griffonstone!
That's the spirit!
[blows party horn]
Whatcha reading, Rainbow?
You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix?
[swallows]
Uh, can I borrow some bits?
Aw, Twilight should've come along!
Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is... a total dump!
Excuse me, sir?
This is Griffonstone, right?
Well, that wasn't very nice.
Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on.
Pinkie!
Hey!
These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!
Well... we're not really sure!
But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and?
Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?
That was the saddest story ever!
No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto.
Who would want to record a history that sad?
I think Rainbow Dash is right!
The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!
Wait, Rainbow Dash.
What about Twilight's advice?
She mentioned finding answers at the library.
Hey, Gilda!
Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!
Okay, maybe not this street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town.
[gasps]
Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't come...
It's sad what happened to your town, King, but Rainbow Dash can't be right.
This can't all be because of a missing hunk of gold.
You are right, Pinkie!
And you've got amazing hair!
Aw, King Grover, you old charmer!
[gasps]
I know what Griffonstone needs!
A song!
I've got a super song about smiling that sure to make even the most grumpy griffon grin!
[inhales]
But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?
Well if I can't sing, how about a party?
If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer!
Where's your party store?
No party store?
Uh, how about cake?
Nothing cheers folks up like cake!
Where's a bakery?
No singing, no party store, no bakery?
What is this place?
Well, that just takes the cake.
Wait, no!
It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake!
Or muffins!
Or griffon scones!
I'll buy one!
[chomp]
[with mouth full]
I think I broke a tooth!
[spits]
I can help you with that!
Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient.
Uh, no.
Baking powder.
Lucky for you, I never leave home without it!
Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!
Aha!
I saw that, Gilda!
You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!
You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.
[poink!
[slide whistle noise]
Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!
[in distance]
There you are!
Forget about finding the idol!
I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's real problem... scones!
[in distance]
Yeah?
[in distance]
Lemme look!
One rope coming up!
We need help.
Don't go anywhere!
Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need your help to save her!
Of course it's your problem!
She's your friend!
Can't you remember when she was?
Duly noted.
Except it does!
Rainbow Dash!
I'm coming for you!
Gotcha!
Hugging later, climbing now!
Apology accepted.
That's what I was trying to tell you!
The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas.
It sent us here to replace it with something better!
That's because you don't have friendship!
If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before!
And you don't need some golden idol to do that.
You just need each other.
Eh, what can I say?
That's how I roll.
Go on, Gilda!
Go make a friend!
[in film reel quality]
Baking powder makes baked goods and friendships fluffy and delicious!
[squee]
[tearing up]
Hugging!
Hugging now!
See ya later, you old charmer.
Nopony!
Come on, let's go home and see how Gummy did with Granny Pie's marjolaine recipe!
Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it!
Making new friends is always fun.
Is it okay to be nervous now?
I did, I did!
Did you know they live so far north of the Crystal Empire that it's cold all the time?
Yaks have yak fur to keep them warm.
[squee]
I know!
Yaks are so cool!
Don't worry.
They'll be in good hooves with me.
No problem!
Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan.
You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!
Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours.
And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!
Okay, well... There's still other things we can do.
I think.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You'll just... make it up to them.
Somehow.
Listen up!
Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!
Hit it, Rainbow Dash!
Just like Yakyakistan snow, right?
Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from.
Seriously?
...Seriously?
It's a disaster!
I definitely will!
I think.
Maybe...
It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever!
I hope!
It's what I do when I'm not nervous!
[laughing hysterically]
Me either!
Gotta go!
Gummy, what am I gonna do?
I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it!
There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan.
They're just too sensitive!
Even Fluttershy made them mad!
Fluttershy!
Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now.
How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?
[gasps]
Gummy, you're a genius.
[kisses]
And so my quest begins.
I know what you're thinking.
Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?
Because I'm the party planner.
This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone.
If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic!
Know what I mean?
Did we go the wrong way?
Where's all the snow?
Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow.
[spits]
Nope.
Sand.
Definitely sand.
Curse you, sheep!
Thanks for you help, conductor.
Cherry Jubilee!
How are you?
You look amazing!
I need help.
Have you heard of Yakyakistan?
Do you have any idea how I can get there?
Counting cherries?
How many?
Whoa!
And so my quest resumes.
As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen.
Know what I mean?
Cherry?
Ravine.
Ravine!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Stooooop!
That's what I said.
There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine.
Down, down, down!
And then, suddenly... Pow!
We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts!
And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart.
And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan!
And so here I am.
It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon.
Know what I mean?
I do.
My name is Pinkie Pie!
I'm looking for Yakyakistan.
You know, faraway land, lots of yaks?
Maybe you've heard of it?
Whoa-ho-ho!
Slow down!
I can't understand a word you're saying?
[yelps]
There it is!
Yakyakistan!
Noooooooooo...
I'm all the way back where I started!
Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks.
Now I've just let everypony down.
Hmm?
Thank you!
Thank you!
I love you too!
All of you!
I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party.
But at the last second, I made a mistake.
[sighs]
I worked harder on this party than any party ever.
But I'm still just a big failure.
You know... the trip was really hard.
But everypony I met along the way was so helpful.
I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is!
[gasps]
I just got the best party idea ever!
Um, no, they didn't.
[squeals]
Trust me!
There are a whole lot of sheep out there!
I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep!
And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!
What can I say?
I'm good at what I do.
Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right.
When I got back from my adventure, I realized something.
We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home.
We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria.
And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too.
For a thousand moons?
Aww, come here, you!
Wow!
Too strong!
Okay, okay, okay!
Wheeeeeeeee!
Whoooooaaa!
That was awesome!
We gotta go flying more often, Twilight!
Hi, Minuette!
Twilight, you didn't say Minuette would be here!
Oh, sure!
She was one of Cadance's bridesmaids!
We hang out all the time when she's in Ponyville!
Didn't you know that?
And you call yourself the Princess of Friendship!
Twilight briefed me on the way here.
We'll need fifteen bags of confetti and as many hooves as we can get.
Surprise!
[whispers to Spike]
Right!
Ooh, this is amazing!
I'm totally beat too!
Ooh!
It'll be like a princess sleepover!
Are you kidding?
This is so exciting, I don't know how I'm ever going to?
[snores loudly]
La-la-la-la-la!
Whee!
Whee, ha-ha!
La-la-la-la-la!
Sorry, can't help it!
An idea pops into my head, it?
[gasps]
Ooh, cake!
Ew, cake!
Sorry!
Who wants ice cream?
It'll be okay!
Everypony makes mistakes!
Phew, that's good to hear!
Although after you left, I did happen to dream that I was eating a giant ice-cream cone with all of Ponyville while taking a test we hadn't studied for.
See, what'd I tell ya?
Everypony makes mistakes!
Then do more!
This is a dream, remember?
Strawberry cinnamon cilantro salutations!
What indeed.
I bet you're wondering what warrants such a welcome!
Well, that welcome is warranted by a pony that whisked up a warm batch of strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcakes!
[chomp]
That strangely sickening flavor combination sounds just as bad as it tastes.
[gulps]
Ugh.
So I came here to offer you some!
Oh, I almost forgot!
I have this letter for you, Rarity!
The post pony was going to deliver it, but after a strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcake, he was feeling kinda queasy.
And since I was heading over anyway, I figured I could do it for him!
Here you go!
[chews]
[with mouth full]
What's it say?
Woo-hoo!
Got what?
Whoo!
I'm so excited, I think I'm gonna lose my cupcakes!
[hurk]
I don't know.
Those hooves don't look nubby.
They look scrubbied and buffied and pedied!
Judging by this baby, TLC stands for Tasty Liquorice Candy!
Oh, no!
Did she mess up that nice pony pedi?
[sighs]
Okay.
Phew!
Cupcake?
All right, everypony!
Get ready for the biggest cute-ceanera celebration ever!
Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... Phew!
Look at that, Pound Cake!
I am so close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record!
Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
Okie-dokie-lokie.
A baby?
Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are having a baby?
[squeals]
This is the best news ever!
I can't wait to tell Twilight!
A top secret surprise?
That means I have to keep the exciting news... to myself!
Even though I didn't technically make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs Cake, I can't tell Twilight or anypony the big news!
That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner!
Right, Gummy?
Did you take that from Pound Cake again?
Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby?
What?
Who?
What?
Who said something about a baby?
Friendship Express rather than the Crystal Empire train so as not to cause too much of a scene when they skip town to come visit?
[squee]
Annnnnd?
[nervous laugh]
Uh... Pinkie Sense?
Surprise?
[nervous laugh]
I have no idea what that's like!
What's this?
Yeah!
[nervous laugh]
Really cute!
[nervous laugh]
But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might explode?
[nervous laugh]
Gotta bounce!
Phew, that was close!
Too close.
I almost spilled the beans.
Beans that would be really hard to clean up!
I obviously can't be around my friends right now.
Or anypony for that matter!
Hmmm... That's it!
If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive!
Then I won't ruin anything!
I... did?
I'll do it!
Sure!
There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies.
No way!
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!
Oh, yeah.
I Pinkie Promised I'd do it.
And I never break a Pinkie Promise!
Never!
[deflates, sighs]
Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony!
Nope!
Ugh!
Fluttershy, what a surprise!
I mean, not a surprise!
[squee]
Definitely!
Got it!
Pinkie Promise!
Yeah!
Heh.
[nervous laugh]
What did you say?
Mine too!
Baby carrots are kinda like big carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their parents but smaller and cuter and?
Albino squirrel!
It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary!
It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that...
Maybe I can tell just one little pony the surprise?
You're right, spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination.
I can't tell anypony at all!
[sighs]
Then they would tell Twilight, and she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault.
[sighs]
Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney.
Wow, great idea!
I'm starving too!
[with mouth full]
This apple is delicious!
What are you having, Gummy?
Oh, no!
It's the list that Twilight helped me make yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises today!
And I have three more things to do!
Aw, four if you count bringing those snacks to Twilight's castle!
I've been getting liberal with those Pinkie Promises lately...
[screams]
It's a... a... puppy!
Ha ha, woof woof, ha ha!
Eh... Next!
Interesting choice of words, Featherweight.
I don't know.
Was it?
No, I'm not!
Noooooo... Nope!
You're welcome!
Treat your foal like... royalty?
Why would they get spoiled?
We're all gonna eat them super soon!
Whaaaaaaaaaat?
You mean... I have... to wait... another whole day?
I don't know if I can!
[inarticulate yell]
[blowing up balloon]
Okay, okay, you win!
[inhales]
Shining Armor and Cadance are gonna have a?
[exhales]
So you're gonna tell Twilight now?
It'd better be.
[through gritted teeth]
They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon...
Nothiiiiiiing!
We get the picture!
You like books!
You've got a scroll, you're on a roll, why don't you take a peek where young ones spend their week?
A piece of paper will continue this caper.
Good enough for me!
Now where's the next clue?
[panting like a dog]
[sneezes]
Focus, everypony!
Aha!
There!
[tapping paper]
A-hem?
Ooh!
I do, I do!
Go down that hall, then you take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and it's the third door from the right!
There's a lot of things I know!
That you don't know I know!
Ugh, really?
None of you?
[groan]
It's obviously the furniture store!
Go in, go in, go in!
Daagh, fine!
It seems we've saved the best for last.
We hope that you have had a blast.
Now it's time to take a break where you can get a slice of cake!
[scoffs]
That was an easy one.
[giggles quietly]
A baby, Twilight!
It's a baby!
Woo-hoo!
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it!
[squee]
[pop]
Go, Pinkie.
Piece of cake!
[squee]
Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!
Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of.
Now multiply that times infinity!
Whoo!
It's gonna be great!
No sirree!
Agh!
Gotta go, bye!
Apples and Pies together again for the first time!
Maybe.
Unless we're related!
Which maybe we're not.
I think I just confused myself.
I don't like you!
I don't like you either!
Beat it, Windigos!
[chewing, with mouth full]
I don't know...
[swallows, licks]
We do that too!
That's what our family does too!
We do that too!
I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am.
What about... rooftastic?
[squee]
As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is!
We are friends, Applejack, and after tonight, our families are gonna be friends too.
Do you know what that means?
Number of Apples times number of Pies is twenty four, minus my preexisting friendships plus one for Maud and you makes five from twenty four is... nineteen new friendships!
Maud!
[squeals]
How's school going?
I missed you so much!
Come on, everypony!
Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family!
Everypony, meet everypony!
Aye aye, Captain Grumpy!
No one's gonna mess with your precious mine!
[sighs]
Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder.
There, you happy now?
This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right?
She's so excited to meet everypony!
Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming!
[whistles]
Attention!
I'll just be a second.
Everypony get settled in!
There's plenty of room upstairs.
And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner!
Hee-hee!
Are you excited for dinner time?
Because guess who is!
Spoiler alert... it's me!
Potato, po-tah-to.
Double-baked pot pie, rock soup!
Dinner is dinner.
Am I right or am I right?
[slurping, exhales]
Is everything all right, Applejack?
More rock, please!
Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls!
Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll?
Don't be silly, silly!
Our dolls are these little pieces!
Isn't that right, Marble Pie?
Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock.
Cheer up!
I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission!
Limestone Pie, you're the judge!
Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one!
Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two!
Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith.
Don't think of it as team old.
Think of it as team three!
And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins!
As everypony knows?
Sheesh.
When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble.
It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day.
But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder?
No, silly, it goes on the highest point!
And who's the lucky pony?
On your marks, get set, go!
I'll explain on the way!
Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone.
Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag!
Well, how else would we do it?
Found it, found it, found it!
Um, that would be weird.
Do you know what this means?
I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents!
Of course!
What's more fun than getting a present?
Finding a present!
Although, most years, nopony finds one.
Eh, not usually.
Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way.
Picturing it... Loving it...
Goodnight, everypony!
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming, Hearth's?
...Yeah, this is gonna be great!
All the stuff she's said.
Right, everypony?
Well, I wanna be one big family!
I, um, well, I-I don't know!
Don't make me choose!
You didn't have to ask them to leave!
This was all a misunderstanding, everypony!
I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony!
Then it's my fault too... I really popped the pinata this time.
[yelps]
What are you doing here?
Aw, no one thinks that!
Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping.
Sorry.
Don't say that!
H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming.
Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh!
[gasps]
Apples!
I think we've just invented our first combined tradition!
Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry!
[squeals]
I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming!
Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you!
And you too, right, Big Mac?
Happy Hearth's Warming!
And then it got very, very quiet and suddenly they realized the balloons had never been inflated!
[squeals]
You can get dressed up in a costume with us and play Nightmare Night games with us and eat candy apples with us!
[squee]
[gasps]
I get it!
You're a robber escaping into the night!
You're a ninja escaping into the night!
You're black licorice escaping into the night!
So creative.
I figured I'd save the really scary games for next year when Fluttershy's more used to it.
Okay... We don't have to finish that game.
I have another one I know you'll love!
Bobbing for apples!
Time for candy!
I made candy bags.
Each bag has been made with each of you in mind, complete with each of your favorite candies!
Here.
Take it.
Take it!
What are you waiting for?
You're not taking out all of the fun.
Really?
Oh, this is so exciting!
Huh?
I can't.
There's nopony there.
What?
We could... stay here?
Eh, it's funny.
I actually thought she had an idea for something really scary for a second there.
It looks like... bones!
Whoo!
How did that get down here?
I can't see!
THE BEST THING EVER!
[squee]
You have to do this every year!
You don't?
Spoooooooooky tea?
It was hilarious!
I wish we'd taken a picture for you!
Sticky situation!
I love important!
Point is, we galloped away.
Time travel?
Wowee!
Me too!
The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae!
Perfect!
He makes a good point.
He makes another good point!
Nope, no glowing tushies here!
Ooh, you look excited!
Yes!
Yeah!
[glug]
What do you [glug]
take us for?
Dee-licious!
Got any more, Twilight?
It's still funny!
You don't look like you feel terrible.
[coughs]
Only way we'd find them funny now is if you put us all under some kind of spell!
Twilight!
Applejack!
Rainbow Dash!
Rarity!
Fluttershy!
Spike!
Pinkie Pie!
Oh wait, that's me.
Everypony!
I have the most amazing news ever!
It is totally gonna freak your frizz!
It wasn't easy.
In fact, it was terribly difficult.
But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music Festival!
Sapphire Shores?
Please!
Sapphire Shores is merely the second biggest pony pop star in Equestria.
I have booked the one, the only, Countess Coloratura!
My frizz has been freaked!
Uh, I just told you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria!
How-how-how-how-how have you not heard of her?
Do you mean to tell me that you actually know Countess Coloratura?
Do you remember her cutie mark?
You mean... like this?
Do you have any idea the number of hoops I had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?
A whole lot of hoops!
That pony is very demanding!
Yah!
I don't have to wait... she's here!
Countess Coloratura!
Ooh!
I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr Manager, sir!
I have twenty glass containers full right here!
Uh, I don't think so.
But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria!
I call this straw Fernando.
Ooh, we shall!
Abso-toot-ly!
See, Applejack?
Demanding!
Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!
[distant]
But... I got everything you requested!
Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!
[gasps]
But that's impossible!
Applejack!
Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said?
Enough stewin', more peelin'!
[groans]
[out of breath]
Yes, Svengallop, sir!
[coughs]
Huh!
Silence, changeling!
A likely story!
Do something dragonish!
[wheezes]
That works!
What does it mean?
[squeals]
Can you do it again?
Or on us!
That Starlight must be pretty magical!
And a party!
And a party!
And... a party!
Pretty!
Ooh!
I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny!
Wow!
A unicorn, and a Pegasus!
So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!
[inhales]
[blows balloon]
This Crystalling is gonna be some party!
[squee]
Well... at least she's having... fun!
Whee!
I'm tryiiiiiiing!
She's a really strong flyer!
So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!
[shrieks]
Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!
Whoa!
You want the long or the short version?
The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow.
Oops.
Is quickly an option?
We're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan...
[squeals]
We're almost there!
Why doesn't your face look like this?
Eee...
And it's about to get everything ever-er!
Because guess who I see!
M-A-U-D!
You know what that spells?
[squee]
Maud, Maud, Maud!
Yay!
Yep!
I do separate trips with each one, and we make it super fun by picking a different location every year!
We see the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset!
And since Maud's getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot for PSSSD!
Huh?
No, silly!
Not pssst, PSSSD!
P-S-S-S-D!
Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day!
[giggles nervously]
Before you go, can I ask you a quick question?
Will you please help me?
Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows mine away!
But this year is going to be different!
For the first time, I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets me!
There's a specialty store here in Manehattan that sells nothing but rock pouches!
A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know Maud will love it!
I know, right?
Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown!
...I can sneak away to pick out a rock pouch!
[gasps]
And if you're coming with us, you can look at boutique locations along the way!
It's the perfect plan!
[echoes out]
Of course.
Got it.
Absolutely.
Maud!
I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever!
But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you!
Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her!
Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud!
[spits]
We're so close to the pouch store!
It's just a block away!
I could practically smell it from here!
If I knew what a pouch store smelled like.
Gotcha!
You are very welcome, Rarity!
Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves!
Sorry!
[gasps]
Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch!
Maud will love it!
I need it!
Ungh!
Huh, must be stuck!
Took a sudden vacation to Canterlot with my grandniece.
Back in a few moons.
Oh, no.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Well, maybe, just maybe, he's already back from vacation and just forgot to take the sign down!
[shouting and pounding on door]
Hello, Mr Pouch Store Owner!
I'd like to hear all about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while buying a pouch for my sister please!
But it can't be.
It just can't be!
If I can't get that pouch... then not only am I not getting my sister the greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD present for my sister at all!
Huh?
Oh, right.
[sighs]
[inhales]
The door to the rock pouch store is locked because the owner's on a sudden vacation to Canterlot with his grandniece for a few moons, and so there's no way I can get the perfect present for Maud, and now I don't have any present for her at all, so it'll be the worst Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day ever!
[inhales]
You're right!
Thanks, Rarity!
Did she like anything?
A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud!
Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window!
It had double stitching, a red drawstring...
Yep, that's the pouch.
Wait, how'd you know?
Excuse me, sir!
I couldn't help but notice your nifty rock pouch!
Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with it?
I really need it.
Like, really really really!
I believe I said really really really.
So you'll sell it to me?
And I'll finally be able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day present?
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
[gasps]
M-My... party cannon...
What you guys lookin' at?
Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and... that's really the only thing that matters.
Yup.
Yup.
Well... I wouldn't say it's lost.
I mean, I know where it is.
It's just... [sighs]
Oh, there's no problem.
It just turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in Manehattan is one party cannon.
Who knew?
Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters.
Maud's going to be so excited.
I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch!
Well, you're going to have to.
We don't just swap, silly.
We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song first!
Ready, Maud?
Okay, time to swap presents!
Hmmmm.
[licks]
I knew you'd love it!
It was all worth it!
Look how happy she is!
And I couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you, Rarity.
Okay!
Time to open your present to me!
You did it again!
You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD!
This is perfect!
This is amazing!
This is incredible!
I love it, I love it, I love it!
What is it?
Maud... You know me so well.
You really are the most thoughtful gift-giver in the world!
I'm gonna love it five-ever!
That's even longer than for-ever.
[sighs happily]
Hee-hee, yay!
I love my sister and my new confetti!
[blows confetti]
I think I know what this is about.
You guys wanna ride the swans.
Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can ri?
Nnngh, it's just... It's just... It's just... You always give better gifts than me!
That's why I had to get you the perfect gift!
Are your hooves dirty?
Where're you going?
Yep!
That sure is the pony I got the pouch from!
Runs in the family!
Maud!
I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back!
Yay!
Uh-oh.
I just realized something.
'Cause you gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've gotten me today!
And it's something I really, really wanted!
You did it again!
Your gifts are always better than mine!
Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up and?
Awwww!
There you are!
You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time!
We've got a train to catch here!
You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever!
But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R!
P-S-S-S-D-W-R!
It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with!
Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day... With Rarity!
Oh, Rarity!
It doesn't matter what you get us!
As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect!
Buuuut now that you mention it... I could use more confetti for my party cannon.
You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day!
Need to make a new friend, huh?
I know just the pony for you!
Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs Cake!
Wow, Mrs Cake!
Look what your new friend made you!
[licks, swallows]
In her defense, it is delicious!
[chomps]
So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour?
Start from when you were a foal and you first knew your destiny was to become a Wonderbolt!
Ooh, ooh, I know!
Pick me!
You're leaving already?
[gasps]
But we barely started your congratulation party!
I haven't even thought about your going-away party yet!
Your best day [through megaphone]
ever party!
Well, look at the bright side!
At least they didn't call you Rainbow Trash!
I can't wait to see Rainbow Dash's first performance as an honest-to-goodness Wonderbolt!
I hope there's cotton candy!
One second!
Just a little bit bigger please, but hurry!
Bigger!
Bigger!
Hope I'm not too late.
[scoffs]
I dunno what took that pony so long.
That was amazing!
Snowfall Frost!
It is I, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents!
Toys, Hearth's Warming doll... Here, want a cupcake?
Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!
Exactly!
Sometimes a cupcake means I love you!
Or a toy means Hi, how're you doing?
Sometimes a book means Your mane looks amazing!
And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold.
That one's easy.
Whoa!
Whoa!
[trembles]
My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents Sense is going off!
That means a song is coming on!
Me too!
Too bad it's going to be the last one ever!
Ever!
Ever!
Ever!
[echoes out]
Maybe she won't read the article.
Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever...
[inhales]
[sneezes]
Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs!
Yeah... Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
And I can go upstairs to that nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party cannons and?
And then make them be quiet.
Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?
Oh, what would Rarity want?
Really?
If you say so!
Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest of beats.
I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene!
I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think.
Oh, no!
Not a shopping music mashup!
I shut down the party.
I'm sorry I made you play that un-fun, super-boring music.
But if you're up for it, I have an idea to make the party even better!
The way I see it, Rarity designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats.
What better combination than a boutique/dance club?
Rainbow Dash!
Fluttershy!
It's me, Pinkie Pie!
Your friend!
Ooh!
Mayor Mare?
Cranky Doodle Donkey?
Cheese Sandwich?
Harshwhinny?
Oh, that makes more sense.
Ooh, well done!
Fluttershy and Twilight in Appleloosa!
No, me and Rainbow Dash in Las Pegasus!
No, Rainbow Dash and Twilight in Yakyakistan!
No, Twilight and Twilight in Twilight's castle!
Oh, me... and Rarity!
Ooh!
I hope it's some faraway place that nopony has gone before!
Y'know, some ponies get excited about the silliest things.
Oh, Rarity, you don't find a friendship problem.
It finds you.
We just need to go with the flow, and eventually, kablam!
We get friendship problem'd right between the eyes.
You know Canterlot.
What do you think we should do?
Ooh, so many choices!
Where should we go?
This one?
That one?
Those ones?
Um, whose hooves?
What's so important about her approval?
Wow!
Then the food here must be amazing!
Lead the way, partner!
Whee!
[giggles]
Nom nom nom.
[gulps, gags]
Maybe, I'm not in the mood for... whatever this is.
Can we try someplace else?
Nom nom.
Ugh.
Maybe one more stop?
Blech!
Nope.
Maybe instead of trusting somepony else's hooves, I should pick the next place?
[sniffing, gasps]
Thank goodness!
Hee-hee!
[sniffs deeply]
Mmmm.
It smells open.
Yes, indeedy!
Yes, please!
We'll take one!
How can you say no to that?
[sighs]
Hiya!
What's your name?
Are you a chef here too?
Then why are you stacking chairs?
[slurps]
So good!
Oh, Rarity, try this!
[spits]
Rarity, I think that friendship problem just kablammed us right between the eyes!
Yes!
Uh, what's it?
[gasps]
And I can pack this place with ponies!
You really don't know Rarity.
See?
Like what?
One packed restaurant, coming right up!
It'll be fine.
Rarity's gonna make sure that The Tasty Treat is the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot!
Not like all of those stuffy places on Restaurant Row.
Try harder!
Fillies and gentlecolts!
Check out the super stupendous and amazing cuisine of The Tasty Treat!
Grand re-opening tonight!
Rrrgh!
Stupid hooves!
Yes!
Yes, it is!
Rarity, what did you do?
I thought we were trying to make this the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot!
Not make it exactly like every other restaurant!
Not that!
Anything but that!
Rarity, how could you ruin the restaurant?
You said you would make the restaurant better...
...so I guess we both didn't know what we were talking about!
What kind of food expert doesn't want flavor?
That's insane!
I'm taking this out there!
No, I'm trying to fix it after you ruined it!
Disreputable?
You mean a place with food that actually tastes good?
I'm so embarrassed.
Mmm, this is the best thing you've made so far!
And I thought the food before was the best!
That's true.
That's double true!
That's true times three!
Oh, you guys!
Group hug!
Now come on!
We've got a party to throw!
And very strange!
Nothing can stop the dynamic duo of Pinkie and Rarity!
I do!
Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie!
Actually, I don't like that part.
But the rest is great!
But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny?
[stifling laugh]
Good one, Rainbow!
Ha-ha!
You have to admit!
That was funny!
Okay!
For what?
Oh, no!
She's been pranking up a storm!
[laughs]
Oh, yeah!
She and Gummy both!
Aaah!
They got me good.
Stop?
But pranks are so much fun!
Hey, Rainbow Dash!
I have something very important to tell you!
You do?
Ooh!
You go first!
Yeah!
[giggles]
It's been pretty funny!
I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about.
Ooh!
Thanks!
[chomps]
Mmm, wow!
Everypony at once?
That sounds amazing!
Gah, wait!
I mean, it's not.
And?
Uh, I don't know.
I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny.
Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while.
The other ponies in town really?
[chomps]
[coughs]
Yeah, I haven't really [coughs]
been feeling well.
And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better.
You don't have any more, do you?
Actually... I don't think I can even... stand... up... Unless you've got more cookies!
[sighs]
Yeah.
You're right.
Sorry to miss out.
I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious.
Cookies... More cookies... 
But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...
Exactly!
Of course not, silly!
Aw, shucks, it was nothing!
Just a little something I threw together.
Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time.
I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't.
Nope!
I brought yeti food!
Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier?
We're gonna have so much fun!
Yeah!
I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!
I don't know anything about it at all.
But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun!
[whispering loudly to Fluttershy]
Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right?
Ohhhh!
Phew!
That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home!
Yaah!
Ohhh.
I get it.
Absolutely!
[grunts]
Aah!
Somersault kick!
Hey, this game is easy!
[grunts]
Whee!
[giggles, grunts]
Yeah!
[giggles]
Whee!
Ha ha!
It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be!
A whole bunch!
Snails!
Look out!
It's a good thing, too.
We were running out of unicorns.
Yeah!
If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is?
That's uncredible!
Unbelievable and incredible?
[scoffs]
Come on!
I do like fun!
Let's get this party started!
Serious how?
Eh, if you say so.
Whee!
Whee!
Whee!
Whoopee!
Woo-hoo!
[grunts]
Whee!
Woo-hoo!
Whoa!
What?
[grunts]
Whoops.
Whoa!
Uhh!
Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Whoa!
I thought practice was supposed to make us better.
Maybe we weren't that bad!
I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't.
I know!
How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team?
Pfft.
Yeah.
I don't think we need to worry.
I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all.
[nervous]
Greaaaaat...
[squeaks]
You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us... Aah!
There's just no way to...
Yeah!
Because... we're totally not in here!
Or anypony else!
[sighs]
Why didn't you say so?
I can do that!
[nervous whimper]
[gasps]
Ooh!
[grunts]
Hee-hee!
Whee!
Yeah!
I could do this all day!
Wait... what?
Oh, yeah!
Weird!
Yeah!
What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win?
Works for me!
Braeburn is really good!
Not think about it?
[giggles]
I think it's more fun this way!
Yeah!
Everypony knows the secret to good buckball is just having fun!
[inhales]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh!
Can we start with me?
We're gonna need time for the cake to bake!
After all...
Mmm!
Okie-dokie!
What would you like to do first?
Whatever you want to do first, Starlight Glimmer.
Take what from where?
Abso-tively!
Instruction following starting... now!
Following all of the instructions in the cookbook in order, Starlight Glimmer!
First, I combined three eggs, then I?
The cakes are burning.
You left the ovens on.
Starlight's spell made me burn perfectly good cake!
I never burn cake!
Hmph!
Tell it to the cake, sister!
Fine!
Somepony has to bake a cake to honor all the poor cakes that sacrificed their batter in last night's tragedy!
That sounds... fun?
Ooh, I brought food too!
Let's see, I've got cotton candy, taffy, circus peanuts, and lots of other super-yummy stuff!
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
It's pinata o'clock!
Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?
Look at me!
I'm the captain too!
So that's what Rarity said happened on the boat, huh?
Of course not!
Pfft, that's just silly!
There's no way Applejack could've sank the boat!
Because Rarity did!
It all started on the docks.
I knew Rarity and Applejack wanted to get out of their element, so I figured I'd throw them the funnest, silliest boat party ever!
But I guess Rarity had other ideas.
I thought I overpacked until I saw Rarity and her team of porter-ponies!
[deadpan]
That sounds fun.
Eh, I can live with that.
Huh.
They just keep coming.
Now, you can't throw a silly boat party without snacks.
So I made sure to pack the funnest party food I could find!
Rarity, would you care for some cotton candy?
It's freshly spun!
Just wait until you hear how much more unlike her she sounds!
I thought I'd lighten the mood with some super-fun party boat games.
But Rarity was a real wet blanket.
It's pinata time!
Ooh!
Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?
That's the spirit!
Let's get this boat party started!
Tug of war?
Now we're talking!
Whoever wins gets to be captain!
Or... one of us should just be captain now?
What?
And that's why the boat sinking was all Rarity's fault.
Oh, it's extraordinary, all right.
But that's exactly what happened!
In fact, the only thing I might've gotten wrong was that there were even more porter ponies!
But just to be safe, you should talk to Applejack.
She'll know exactly how many porter ponies there were!
Oh, that's easy.
We just?
[sniffs]
My muffins!
And more fun than you can shake a stick at!
[squee]
Because I brought a stick!
Bet you I can fit them all in my mouth!
Ahh... Me neither!
Hum-ph!
It's Pinata Whacking Time!
Meh.
Hee-hee!
Captain Pinkie Pie reporting for map duty!
It's a good thing it was time for Gummy's bath, or I might not have seen your note about the emergency, Twilight!
What?
Why would you want me to apologize when it was Rarity's fault?
Yeah!
We sure do.
Sounds like a stretch.
Wait, the storm had nothing to do with the capsizing?
Pfft?
What?
Who?
Of course!
I figured the boat trip was the perfect time to do things that were silly and fun!
Well, there's something I'd like to communicate to you all right now!
You girls are the best friends a pony could ever have!
You got it!
Come on, bunyip, sir!
You got it!
And getting an invitation to a party and not going?
That's like... I-It's like... Well, I don't know what it's like, but it is definitely bad.
Hey... you!
Where were you?
Ooh, sounds fun!
How was it?
Ooh, sounds awful!
Bye!
Hmmm.
Phew!
Yeah!
Uh, no.
Not quite.
Uh... all right.
There it is!
Yay!
[squeals]
That's so exciting!
And surprising.
Usually, you tell your party planner about all your plans for your party.
[squeals, giggles]
What a great surprise!
Phee-yew!
Me, too!
I'm not great at solving riddles, but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it!
Go, us!
Ooo, ooo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Go, Twilight!
you can do it!
Woo-hoo!
Yay!
We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true!
Yaaaay, us!
Woo-hoo!
You can do it!
And when not to sing songs!
I'm good.
Here they are.
Of course I can!
In my secret party planning cave!
BRB!
I am pretty awesome.
Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.
I've got a stamp for that!
Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!
[noise of alarm]
Mmm... The sampler platter.
Go, Maud!
Woo-hoo!
Number one!
Number one!
Whoo!
Doctor Pie!
Doctor Pie!
...Rock-tor Pie?
Yeah, you are!
Brilliant speech!
Encore!
Encore!
You are so welcome!
Brilliant speech!
Encore!
Encore!
Encore!
[long high-pitched squeal, rapidly]
You're moving to Ponyville!
We'll live together and get bunk beds and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say Best Sister Friends Forever, although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper, so maybe just BSFF, but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, the doctor is in!
Yooooouuuuu'rrrrrrrreeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmooooooooovvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggg tttttttooooooo Pooooooooooonnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyvvvvvvviiiiiiilllllllleeeeeeeee....
Of course you are, silly.
You said... There's nothing left to study back home on the rock farm, so I might move to Ponyville.
[laughs]
Classic Maud sense of humor!
You should do stand-up!
[gasps]
Ghastly Gorge?
That terrible, awful, no-fun, all-alone canyon in the middle of nowhere?
But Ponyville is so eee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
and Ghastly Gorge is so Blegh!
But what about BSFFs?
Phew!
So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge?
Challenge accepted.
We'll drop your stuff off at my place, and then hold onto your world, 'cause it's about... to... get... rocked!
Ghastly Gorge may have rocks, but our gem cave rocks!
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, and look!
You'll never know who you'll see!
Just another day in Ponyville!
They are?
Uh, I mean, heh, come on!
Of course they are!
That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you!
I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, heh, say hello to your old pal... Spike!
Way to go, Maud!
Cross that off the to-do list!
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
Check!
Now, let's get moving, 'cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell All right!
See?
Ha-ha!
Ta-da!
It's a castle... made of rocks!
Whaaaat?
Did I just blow your mind?
I think I just blew your mind.
But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-build gem followed a rainbow and buried itself in the ground!
I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?
No, you haven't!
But... but...
Oh, look at those rocks!
So they are!
But, uh... look at that rock!
It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!
Whose side are you on, Tank?
Oh, wait a minute!
What's that?
It's a rock shaped like Lyra Heartstrings!
Total rock!
[sighs]
I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all.
Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you.
You said it's a rock-based decision.
[gasps]
Are you saying you want... a friend?
[gasps]
Maudileena Daisy Pie, this'll be easy!
What're you looking for in a friend?
Gimme six qualities assigning each one a numerical importance rating between one and seven, seven being essential and one being eh.
[burps]
I get you.
Maud, you are the best!
You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike.
Somepony could come barreling through that door at this very moment and become your best friend!
Y'know, I really thought somepony was gonna come barreling through that?
Whaaaaat?
[squeals]
How is this possible?
[screams]
[laughs]
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's not tell anypony that part where you maybe, for sure, accidentally helped Starlight enslave a town!
[laughs, seriously]
Tell nopony!
[through the side of her mouth]
Offer to help.
Offer to help!
Of course you do!
[squeals]
They're totally gonna be best friends and then Maud will choose Ponyville, and we'll get to wear BSFF slippers!
Pizza delivery!
Maud and Starlight?
You're here too?
Whoa-ho-ho!
What a coincidence!
'Cause I was just, y'know, delivering this pizza to, um... you!
So how's it going?
Hey!
You could use this time to bond and talk about feelings!
For example, do you feel like you're becoming friends?
Great!
I'll go next.
I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends!
I mean, your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville!
No pressure, Starlight.
Um, hello?
Where'd you two go?
There you are!
I thought you went your separate ways but you can't imagine how happy I am to find you both together and to witness one of your firsts as friends!
First time discovering an underground cavern!
[squeals]
I can't wait 'til you're old and eating pistachios together and telling your grand-foals about this!
Oh, no!
They're not bonding!
I got an idea!
Whooaa!
I'm tripping on a rock at this very moment!
And now I'm falling down!
Oh, no!
My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here!
Where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued.
I'm thinking you wear these around your neck at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies!
That way, I can track your progress as friends!
Ooh!
And tomorrow, we can have a friendship brunch!
What's your favorite kind of omelette cupcake?
Mine's jalapeno red velvet!
You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food!
Come on!
Tomorrow's brunch is going to be the scrumptiest, brunchiest, munchiest brunch ever!
The problem is, while you two were alone, I couldn't get data points on your friendship probabilities!
Were you making Starlight smile?
How was Starlight's smile-to-frown ratio?
Anything over five-to-one is great!
Oh, and how many times did you smile like this?
[squees]
Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself!
You've got the best friendship-maker in Ponyville on the case!
I'll be by your side the whole time!
Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!
Buuuuuut?
Don't worry, Maud.
When you see this brunch, you'll realize everything's gonna be okay!
And then, I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days!
You and Starlight will be besties in no time!
Goodnight!
[kisses]
[clap, clap]
...Cupcake omelette...
Friendship brunch!
Maud!
Wait!
Maud!
Maud...
Starlight, wake up!
Maud left in the middle of the night!
[sniffs]
Why couldn't you two just be friends?
You do?
Hey!
You really were becoming friends?
[deep gasp]
[whimper]
I have to go!
[sniffs]
[licks]
[chews]
Maud tracks!
[shrieks]
Are you okay, Maud?
That eel almost ate you!
[yelps]
Is it a rock?
[shrieks]
Maud!
Don't say that!
It was all my fault!
[shrieks]
I thought I knew everything about making friends, but I didn't even know my own sister!
I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way!
Exactly!
Maud, I thought you couldn't make a friend without my help, but it turns out you couldn't make a friend with my help.
I underestimated you, and I'm sorry.
Oh, Maud!
I love you bigger than all Equestria!
[sniffs]
I don't know what that means, but please please please please please give Ponyville another chance!
But more importantly, give me another chance... to leave you alone.
Yes!
My sister's totally staying in Ponyville!
I mean Ponyville-adjacent!
[laughs]
Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving!
I promise.
I'm not even here.
Aah, you're wearing the slippers!
Okay, now I'm really leaving.
Buh-bye!
Heh-heh... Wrong way.
Okie-dokie-lokie!
Oh, goody!
Is your dream to make a bouncy castle shaped like a gigantic bundt cake?
Huh.
Just me then.
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
I know somepony, too!
Hard Hat is the best construction pony in Ponyville.
He can build anything you could ever, ever, ever want!
Sneaky!
I like it!
See, Fluttershy?
Whatever you want.
I know, right?
Who would've guessed that Hard Hat wouldn't build whatever you want?
All right, Fluttershy!
And a carrot cake stand here?
Wow!
We should call you Flutterbold now!
Whatcha got here?
Lost dog?
Balloons for sale?
Guitar lessons?
'Cause I found one, I need some, and yes, I am interested!
[imitating guitar riff]
Oh, wow!
What an awesome idea!
Sassy Saddles?
What?
I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense.
See?
Now it all... still doesn't make any sense.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Lemme try!
Excuse me.
Have you ever heard of Applejack?
Aw, booooo!
Hey, Applejack!
On your way home?
How'd the first day of the contest go?
Hey, Rarity!
Applejack says the contest is going great!
Good thing she's there, huh?
You seem a little stressed.
Wanna try?
Music is very relaxing.
[strums guitar]
[blows]
Rarity, what's going on?
Is everything okay?
...And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour.
But the hour's up!
Ta-da!
Can you believe it?
After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote!
[screams]
This is so exciting!
Eeeeee!
Oh, wow!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh!
Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh!
Sorry, Applejack!
Twilight!
Twilight!
Where are you?
You'll never guess what I just got!
A good thing!
Prince Rutherford is officially inviting me to Yickslurbertfest in Yakyakistan!
I subtly hinted for an invitation in my letters to him.
May I please come to Yickslurbertfest?
Pretty please?
Pretty please?
Pretty please?
Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty please?
After my seventeenth scroll, I think he picked up what I was putting down.
[giggling excitedly]
[giggling excitedly]
I won't let you down!
It's an honor to be the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
Yet.
You're the princess of friendship.
You can make it happen.
Ahem?
You have to make it official!
This is officially the most exciting day of my life!
Yoo-hoo!
Gummy!
Pay attention!
We're in the middle of an official friendship ambassador road trip game!
That's better.
Okay.
I spy with my official friendship eye something that is blue!
[gasps]
We're here!
Oh, and by the way, the answer was sky.
I win!
Yeah, I know.
That was a hard one, Gummy.
You're the best official friendship travel companion ever!
What is going on?
Yikes!
It's an honor to [grunts]
be here, prince.
Uh, did something terrible happen?
Is Yickslurbertfest cancelled?
Ohhhhh.
I didn't know that was part of the sacred holiday.
So this angry display of destruction is part of the festivies.
Huh.
And here I thought you yaks were just in a bad mood.
This is awesome!
[gasps]
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!
I was just trying to get into the spirit of Yickslurbertfest.
[distressed noises]
Maybe I can fix it!
Phew!
Oh, you sure did, Prince Rutherford.
[chuckles, to Gummy]
That was a close one, Gummy!
This trip has to be perfect!
After all, we're not just visiting as friends.
We're on official friendship ambassador business!
Stompie-stompie-stompie-stompie!
Thanks, Prince Rutherford, but, heh, I've been to Yakyakistan before.
You're right!
It's so different, now that you've pointed it out.
[chuckles]
[gasps]
No way!
I thought you hired professional contractors!
Here.
Uh, let me help you with that.
Oooh!
I have so much to officially tell the ponies when I get back.
[slurp, chomp, gulp]
Mmmm!
The perfect balance of vanilla extract.
[chomp, gulp]
Huh!
This is beautiful and?
[claps, in deep voice]
Pink pony like yak story!
Official friendship ambassador and honorary yak?
[squeals]
Pink pony's title card is full!
Horn bump!
Oh, wait!
I don't have a horn!
[gasps]
Prince Rutherford, can I get some honorary yak horns?
Is this part of the festival?
Everything is buried in snow!
What are we gonna do?
All the time?
Okay.
Avalanches like this completely bury all your homes every Yickslurbertfest?
Really?
Oh, good.
You have an emergency plan in place.
Here, let me help!
Whew.
I'm tired.
We must be almost done.
There's still snow everywhere?
[whine]
Okay.
Don't worry, Prince Rutherford.
I'll go back to Ponyville and ask for help.
Twilight and the others will be happy to come dig the snow away.
After all, many hooves make light work.
Right, Gummy?
Well, I'm sure it'll be okay, 'cause you probably have a Plan B.
All this snow?
It'll take a thousand moons before it melts!
Well... be that as it may, in the meantime, what will you eat?
Where will you sleep?
[yelps]
Uh, of course pink pony agrees with you!
[nervous chuckle]
Hey, let's try out some snow recipes!
Snow cakes!
Snow spaghetti!
Snow sandwiches!
[nervous chuckle, chomp]
Mmmm!
Yaks can make this work!
[groans]
[chomp, gulp, shiver]
Mmmm!
Just the right balance of cold and water!
Psst!
Prince Rutherford.
What are we doing?
So we're swaying to?
[gasps]
Gummy, did you hear that?
They can't make it work!
If Twilight and the others knew what was going on, they would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat.
We have to convince Prince Rutherford that asking for help is okay.
Will you help me, Gummy?
Thank you!
And see?
Asking you to help wasn't hard at all.
Pink pony has gathered you around the new ceremonial yak fire pit to tell you a story!
A yak tradition, right?
Yay!
This is a story about a group of... uh, goats!
Who lived in the desert.
There was a sandstorm, and their entire village was buried in sand.
There was nothing they could do.
They knew they could not survive by only eating sand... wiches!
[giggles]
Get it?
...Okay.
Anyway...
Finally, the goats' brave, wise leader... let's just call him Prince... uh... Drutherford [giggles] decides that they couldn't do it by themselves.
So he asked the neighboring town of, uh, Bovineville to come help them.
[giggles]
Yeah!
Cows!
The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!
Because they asked for help.
The end!
So what is the moral of that story?
Is it... asking for help is okay?
asking for help saves the day?
Or... asking for help is good for everypony?
Um...
[nervous chuckle]
Not quite.
Any yak wanna shout out another answer?
[whines]
Hey, Prince Rutherford.
I wanna talk to you about something.
Uh, what are you doing?
Okay, yeah.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.
You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in.
They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice.
And the yak snow sandwiches?
Mm-mmm!
I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!
You know who would really, really enjoy these snow sandwiches?
Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies!
Oh, hey!
I have an idea!
Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?
Ponies love snow sandwiches!
And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away.
Fun, right?
W-W-Wait a minute.
You spent the whole winter in a hole?
Okay.
First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping?
And how did it freeze over so fast?
And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole?
Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?
But the yaks are hungry!
And who knows when the snow will melt?
I just don't understand why?
Fine!
Be stubborn!
[groans]
Those yaks are so stubborn!
They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it!
Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves!
I'll show them!
[sighs]
You're right, Gummy.
I am too worked up.
Road trip game would officially calm me down.
I know!
Let's play Twenty Million Questions!
You think of something, then I'll ask you twenty million questions until I can come up with what you're thinking of!
Let's go!
Is it blue?
Is it green?
Is it red?
Is it greenish-red?
Is it reddish-blue?
Is it bigger than a bread box?
Is it smaller than a bread box?
Is it a bread box?
Is it bread?
...Is it teeth?
Is it Granny Smith's dentures?
Is it you?
Is it a rooster?
Is it a red rooster?
Is it a red rooster eating corn?
Used up all twenty million questions!
Oh, well.
We're here anyway.
Then Prince Rutherford said, Bang!
Pretend there is door!
I just slammed it!
So then pink pony said, Fine!
Be stubborn!
So in conclusion, we have to help the yaks!
Stop!
We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!
The yaks are very proud.
They won't ask for help.
You know what they say... you can lead a yak to water, but you better not let him know you're doing it.
Is it yellow?
Is it slimy?
Is it slimy yellow?
First, we have to infiltrate the yak compound.
[grunts]
These walls are high.
Sneaking in will not be easy.
Go ahead!
I'll catch up!
You all know what to do!
Just play it cool!
We didn't help fix Yakyakistan!
[nervous chuckle]
No, no!
We're just here for the snow sandwiches!
But then we got here, and the snow was gone, so we thought we'd hit a diner on our way back to Ponyville!
Bye-bye!
Yak not?
I do?
Huh!
I do!
Yippee!
My own honorary yak horns!
Now I can officially horn-bump!
Whoa!
Yeah...
You know, this is a little heavy for my small pony head.
[deep voice]
Pink pony no need apple pony's help!
Just kidding!
Pink pony got apple pony good!
Seriously, this is heavy.
Uh, Discord?
Are you okay?
Oh, Discord.
You're waaaaaay overthinking things.
All you have to do is make Fluttershy feel comfortable.
It should be pretty easy for you.
You know her so well!
Eh, it's what I do.
Excuse me!
Where can I find the glowing, flying, self-folding napkins?
Wait a minute.
[gasps]
Is this our old friendship journal?
I haven't seen this thing in forever!
[giggles]
Well, I am surprised!
Aww, Cheese Sandwich!
Party cannon!
Birth-iversary!
I'm in!
Yay!
Twilight!
Isn't it amazing?
Our journals are everywhere!
Ponies keep stopping by to tell me my entries are hilarious!
I even had somepony come all the way from Las Pegasus to say how much he liked my lessons!
Giggly feedback is the best kind!
Aww, that's too bad.
Wait.
That wasn't even funny.
Yup.
Bye, Twilight!
You've known me for years!
At least ponies aren't laughing every time you talk!
Not even I want to be funny all the time!
I'm telling you, my days of hilariosity-ness-ness are over!
Or how we don't let it affect us!
[giggles]
Go ahead!
Laugh!
Fan-tizzy-astic!
I just love to read about happy happenings, and it's always good to be a pony in the know, you know?
And there's so much to know!
Does New Shrubbery In Castle Garden sound like boring hooey to you?
What about... Parasprite Infestation In Fillydelphia Eradicated?
That's great news!
Noodles Named Official Food Of Whinnyapolis.
Author A.
Yearling Announces Retirement.
Cloudsdale Election Heating Up For Candidate In Favor Of Cooling It Down.
I never knew you were so into politics, Rainbow.
I'd have never have picked noodles as the official food of Whinnyapolis either, but here we are.
Yearling just retired.
Like, today.
Are you sure she wants visitors?
Okay!
Heeeey... You're not just trying to make sure she writes more Daring Do books, are you?
Nope.
She's home.
Because she's right there looking all sad and alone.
Now she's sighing with the weight of the world.
Now she's hanging her head in utter despair.
Now she's shaking her hoof and cursing the heavens like nothing could ever possibly be the same again.
Why, oh, why did this happen to her?
Whoops.
Never mind.
That time, she was just stretching.
[chuckles]
Oooh!
Sparky!
Of course, if you don't feel like talking about it, that's A-okay, A.
As your friends, we completely understand.
Right, Rainbow Dash?
Wake Of Destruction: Daring Do Ruins Entire Village Marketplace!
Daring Do Leads Bull Into China Shop During High-Speed Chase?
That's not true.
They're not mad at A.
Yearling.
They're mad at Daring Do.
Then I guess it's a good thing you look so different as A.
Yearling!
Easy-peasy-cheesy!
Then you are in a tricky pickle.
But why is all this happening now?
But if we go there, the ponies can tell you in person just how much they appreciate you.
What happens?
No, wait, don't tell me.
I changed my mind!
Tell me!
Ah, puh!
There's no chance that these ponies don't think you're a hero.
Two angry ponies!
I dunno.
It really seemed like she doesn't want us cramping her saddle.
Mmmmm.
My nose is telling me to help myself to muffins.
Ooh, she's fancy.
I got this.
A good evening to you, madame.
We are but weary travelers who humbly wish to inquire on the status of a certain mare of intrigue taking residence here.
Is it true that Daring Do stays here?
They are super bad!
But we're still staying the night, right?
[chomp]
Because I already ate all the free mini muffins!
[giggles]
Yeah!
And then I'll be like, What she said!
Exactly!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I know him!
He's a baddie!
He's got Rainbow Dash!
Come on!
I'm... coming... Rainbow... Dash...
I knew you'd come!
You won't.
I just do!
You wouldn't let anything happen to Rainbow Dash.
You care too much.
Don't worry, Rainbow!
We'll save you!
If this really is like Somnambula's story, then we just have to have hope that we can.
I don't know, but Rainbow Dash is our friend.
Just like Somnambula.
We need to make a leap of faith and hope that we can save her!
[grunts]
Wheeee!
[giggles]
I knew we'd do it!
We're just glad you're back to your old self again.
Yeah!
All you gotta do is make it right.
Feel free to use that in your next book!
We were just celebrating the anniversary of the twins' first sneezes!
[giggles]
[clears throat]
Oh, that's because it's not just party string.
It's super-sticky celebration string!
Sorry.
I guess my sneeze-versary was a little too sneeze-abratory.
[giggles nervously]
If only we had some kind of super-sudsy mane conditioning shampoo for you and a magical cleaning remover potion for me.
That's good, because it would take forever to yank all of those baked goods out of the super-sticky celebration string.
Do you think Photo Finish would want to take a picture of my mane?
Even Yakyakistan?
Don't worry!
Zecora will abso-tively be able to help!
I'll have those cupcakes cleaned off in no time!
Nah!
Really?
Well, I love a good scary story!
[giggles]
Anything about curls that keep on curling until your whole body is one big curl?
Wow!
That's just what I have to do!
Huh, weird.
Geez, Zecora, I can take a hint.
It won't be hard to focus on the super-sticky celebration string.
It's kinda the only thing you can see.
Zecora says it would only take a few drops, but I figured we should all chip in.
Just in case!
Remember to only focus on the party string.
We don't wanna accidentally remove anything else.
Ooh!
Sudsy!
[giggles]
Wheeeeeeee!
Shampoo?
Wow!
That explains why our manes are all so bouncy and soft!
Great!
Hey, is there something different about you?
New hoof polish?
Oooh, look!
It's the Most Beautiful Manes in Equestria issue of Vanity Mare!
You should read it.
Read it!
Okay.
All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger.
Pie baking is more art than science.
And this will be my masterpiece!
It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!
I know!
The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue.
The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons.
But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session!
[giggles]
Could you please pass the... brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?
Phew!
That's because I know how much she loves them!
My pies are her favorite!
It's worth all the trouble to see her happy.
Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes?
Ooh!
Cocoa bar!
[chomp]
Want some?
Oh, Twilight!
That's hilarious!
You don't mix chocolate into a blueberry pie!
This is my mid morning, pie-making chocolate fuel that keeps this pie baking train chugging down the tracks!
[chomp, babbles, gulp]
Break time's over!
Now let's finish this pie!
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!
Surprise!
Happy seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!
[blows party horn]
I know!
I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!
I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to!
Have a bite.
I knew you'd love it!
Have more.
I made the whole thing for you.
Of course not!
I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway.
Congratulations again!
[sighs]
I knew she'd love it.
Is that... Is that...
Stop!
You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?
Right.
Of course you didn't.
That would be ridiculous.
Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies.
She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right?
Right?
Hmmm... That pie couldn't have been the one I made.
I must be seeing things.
I did have a lot of chocolate this morning.
[chomp, gulps]
But what if I wasn't seeing things?
What if that was my pie?
[scoffs]
That would be bananas!
[chuckles, laughing crazily]
[gasps]
Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!
Or... has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?
You make a good point.
Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed.
Plus she hates washing.
Hmm.
There's something else going on here.
Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her.
The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday... and her three half-birthday lemon meringues... and the It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day custard pie!
She ate all of these... Right?
Happy It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day!
Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies?
And do I always look when somepony points behind me?
What's there?
Heh.
Good one.
But I need answers.
I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?
Hmm... Interesting.
Very interesting.
As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest.
So it's best you tell me everything you know.
[gasps]
Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?
I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles.
When did it start?
Hmmm... And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket peach pie.
It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty.
[gasps]
Note to self... Alliteration Pie.
Is that everything, Doctor?
Interesting.
Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?
Perhaps.
And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!
Indeed.
But where do these pies come from?
Did you say the day after her half-birthday?
Very, very interesting.
Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year!
And I have a feeling it's the same pie.
I'm so glad.
At least I can be sure somepony is.
She didn't eat the blueberry.
She didn't eat the banana.
She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate.
She didn't eat any of 'em!
Why?
And don't tell me this all just started recently!
It's been going on for years!
Cheerilee said so herself.
If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!
Rainbow Dash doesn't like pie, and she's been lying to me about it the whole time!
[screams]
[muffled scream]
Screaming is fun.
But I'm not okay!
I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them.
She's been lying to me!
Thank you!
Have you reeeaaally?
Are you sure?
Exactly!
Because it's all been a sham!
Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!
Nooooooo!
I don't think so either.
I know so.
Yes.
I will make pies.
Lots of pies.
I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth.
Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them.
Operation: Pie of Lies is a go.
Thanks, Applejack.
I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan.
Surprise!
Happy unofficial Wake Your Friends Up Day!
Well, it's unofficial.
But I made you your favorite pie in celebration!
Ta-da!
Gifts are the second most important part of Wake Your Friends Up Day.
Accepting the gifts and enjoying them immediately.
[sneezes]
[sneezes]
The pie!
Where'd it go?
How?
Where?
When?
[distressed sounds]
Congratulations on your seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session!
Here's a pie.
Now eat it!
Well, I wanted to pre-celebrate because I already know how great you're gonna do.
Eat the pie!
I'm not gonna fall for?
[screams]
Whoa!
Get me down!
But the pie!
What happened to the pie?
Noooooooo!
Somepony help me!
Rainbow Dash, thank goodness you're here!
I was trying to fix the top pie on my pie pyramid, but the whole thing became unstable.
And there's only one way to save me!
You have to eat the pies!
Oh, right.
Or you could save me that way.
[growls]
Rrgh!
Rainbow Dash!
I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, so have a pie!
Have three!
Have fifteen!
I know how much you love them!
Now eat up!
What!
Where did they?
How did you?
[growls]
Rainbow Dash, there you are!
I made a pie for everypony, and you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet.
So here.
Your pie.
For you to eat.
Now.
I just really like to watch others enjoy my pies.
Nope.
I'm not much of a blinker.
Don't mind me.
Go ahead and take a bite.
Just try some.
[grinding teeth]
What?
That's it!
I can't take it!
Everything is not okay!
You hate my pies!
You know exactly what I'm talking about!
I saw what you did!
Well, I didn't see what you did.
But I know that you've been fake-eating my pies!
You threw away the pie I made for your seventy-third Wonderbolt training session, and I know you secretly somehow got rid of all the other pies I gave you!
Admit it!
How could you?
But you just said they were delicious.
Your memory is working fine, you hate washing, and I know today's not Opposite Day because I baked you a pie for it every year.
A pie that you'd probably just throw away.
Or give to charity.
Or destroy with your laser eyes while laughing at me!
So you admit it!
I don't want to hear it!
Pee-yew!
Gummy, is that you?
Huh.
What is that?
It's you.
Yes, I know exactly how many.
I have a very detailed pie-ling system.
Wait.
That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?
Wait!
I can't watch you do this!
I mean, is that crust or some kind of concrete?
Oh, I can't believe you're willing to eat this terrible pie for me.
It's ridiculous, and this whole thing is overly complicated, and... [sighs]
I think I finally understand why you lied.
[squeals]
I'm so glad you enjoyed my pies!
[high-pitched squeal]
Seeing you eat my pies makes me the happiest pony in all of Equestria!
You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy.
Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy.
And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends.
Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!
Just remember.
In the future, you can always be honest with me.
No, they're not.
Uh, yeah.
Weren't you listening?
[gasps]
You figured something out?
[slurps]
Well, you did ask for a magical explanation.
I suppose being trapped for all time with a super-duper bad guy in limbo might be okay if you were doing the limbo, but that's still pushing it.
And the blindfold Somnambula wore when she faced that nasty sphinx!
This old blindfold was stuck in the drain.
Oh, yeah!
You're just saying that because you didn't have to scuba dive in a pit of green slime to get yours!
Weeeeell... we did have to save everypony from Nightmare Moon and Discord and Chrysalis and King Sombra and Lord Tirek, and there was that one time when Starlight traveled through time and almost destroyed life as we know it!
But that's all in the past.
You know, the sparkly crystal things that grow from the Tree of Harmony and represent each of us?
Laughter, honesty, generosity, loyalty, kindness, and magic!
And I get how this part of Equestria used to be cast in eternal night where the Pony of Shadows could draw power and wreak havoc while ponies were powerless to stop him.
But... it's kinda made a comeback!
Did I mention it's really bright?
Especially not magic!
Friendship power rush!
Whoo!
And Mount Aris!
Ooh, Starlight!
Did you know we made seashell necklaces for aaaaaaaaaaall the seaponies?
How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?
Sure we can!
We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint...
Well, the students are gonna love my confetti cannon class.
It's gonna be... a blast!
Awww.
Not even a teeny cannon?
[screams]
First day at school!
So many new ponies!
That was unexpected.
Prince Rutherford!
...putting myself to sleep!
[snores]
[whispering, to Spike]
You didn't tell me this was a pity party!
I would've brought ice cream!
What?
Do we still get to guess?
Confetti cannons for everycreature?
Yippeeeee!
Cupcake-gram for Prince Rutherfoooord!
Because... you don't have to be mad anymore!
We're reopening Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship!
And it's gonna be super-uper-duper better than before!
We're?
Maybe they were attacked by a ferocious shrimp!
Nopony ever expects that!
Nope!
That's why nopony expects it.
Hi, Sandbar!
Are you having a party?
[squee]
Go someplace we could all hang out and eat lots and lots of cupcakes!
What?
Plus, all your nations won't go to war if you come back with us!
Bonus!
[laughs]
[laughs]
It's funny, 'cause it's true!
[laughs]
Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?
Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your... your everything!
You got me!
C'mon, let's celebrate sister-style.
We can get matching stickers that says Eyes on the Pies, then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I could plan for tomorrow if you want.
Aww, that's what you said yesterday.
And the day before that.
And the day before the day before that.
[sighs]
It's just, we haven't hung out in a really long time because you always have other plans.
Even when you promised to build whipped-cream pyramids with me.
Apology accepted, as long as we get some serious sister time before your birthday.
And there's, uh, definitely no reason I wanna hang out before your birthday.
Just, you know, not planning anything special.
What about tomorrow morning?
Yay!
Just you and me.
Best sister friends forever!
I can't wait for tomorrow to be today.
[extended squeal]
Tomorrow is today!
Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner?
The answer is you!
I would also accept Maud.
Maud?
Maud!
[gasps]
Oh, I get it!
We're playing hide-and-go-seek!
Aha!
Found you!
Where's Maud?
I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan!
She has to be here!
Story checks out.
Or does it?
It does.
But are you sure there's nopony hiding... in your closet?
I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today.
I wasn't gonna tell her why, silly.
But now I can't even find Maud.
I'm usually way better at hide-and-seek than this.
Really?
Thanks, Starlight!
Just checking.
I've gotta get very important ingredients for a very important pony's cake.
And it's gotta be tippy-top super-duper secret.
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony.
Um, whatcha doin'?
Rrrrrright.
Okay.
Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh... What are you doing anyway?
I mean, can I help you move this along?
What are you looking for?
Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with tails and fins?
That's what you've been standing here all this time to say?
Uh... but, they're the same thing.
Yyyyyeah, same thing.
In that case, apology not accepted.
Goodbye, later, see ya?
same thing!
Ugh!
Can you believe that guy?
Huh?
Out to Lunch?
Oh, come on!
[groans]
No Maud, no cake, no anything!
And how annoying was that pony?
Who takes so long to say goodbye?
Or was it see ya later?
Ugh!
Now he's got me doing it!
Maud!
Found you!
My turn to hide!
Hee-hee!
Oh, pssh.
What are you apologizing to me for?
I'm not upset, you silly-willy.
Wanna hang out right now?
I mean, I can see you're not doing anything with anypony else.
Unless they're invisible or reeeeeaaaally small.
A wha...
A whaaa...
A whaaaaa...
That's so exciting!
My sister, in love!
Tell me everything!
Who is he?
What's his favorite color?
Does he like ice cream?
If he were a bird, what kind of bird would he be?
Wait.
Is he actually a bird?
I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!
Well, I love you, so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend!
Oh, I can't wait to meet him!
[gasps]
He's a rock!
And you love rocks, so it's perfect!
[gasps]
Is Boulder jealous?
[gasps]
A wha-whaaaaaaaaa?
You?
You?
You... I mean, [laughs] you!
You, you, you!
I'm sorry.
Let's start over.
Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie.
Sooooo... how did... you two meet?
You're into rocks, too?
Then why were you at a rock show?
I'm... really into sticks, too!
They're great for hitting pinatas!
Haaaaa... You wanna go first?
It is?
I'm sorry.
Oh, this is awful.
I'm not being a very good sister.
Let's start over.
I'm Pinkie Pie!
Nice to meet you!
Your pet likes fetch!
[whispering, to Maud]
It's just a stick.
[sighs]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
One more time.
[through gritted teeth]
I'm Pinkie Pie!
Nice to meet you!
[growls, snort]
Daaah!
I don't get this guy!
[groans]
How could she like someone so weird?
He has an inanimate object for a pet!
Boulder has ten times the personality of some random stick!
Mudbriar, too, for that matter.
He's not like Maud at all!
Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!
But this guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange.
[laughs]
You're so funny, Starlight!
Maud is nothing like Mudbriar.
If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever.
[groans]
That's easy... nothing!
I guess...
That I can do!
Listen.
Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste.
You're not afraid of slides, are you?
No reason.
Wheeeeeee!
Welcome to my party planning cave!
Yeah, okay.
Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party... edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble pinata.
Uh... we'll skip that one.
Suggest away!
That's why you're here!
You and me!
Planning... together!
Friends!
Hmph.
Let me see this vision board.
Where does it say that?
She never told me that!
Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!
Well, technically, I don't care!
And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think I'm the expert here!
Oh, but fine.
If you don't believe me, let's ask her!
But we have to be super-sneaky.
Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding!
And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud.
See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh]
you don't like surprise parties!
Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry]
wrong he is?
Hmmmm.
See?
Wait, what?
No party?
No party?
Did he put you up to this?
Maybe you should consider, I don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because he's kinda sort of... impossible to like?
I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!
[gasps]
Technically?
Ugh, you even like the way he talks?
[gasps]
[tearing up]
Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.
I don't understand!
How could Maud like Mudbriar?
Is it Opposite Day?
Nothing makes sense!
What if I don't like cupcakes?
[screams]
Good morning!
Oh, wait.
Bad morning.
[groans]
Ohhh.
You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.
Well, it all started when?
[sad groan]
It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.
Don't be!
He's super-duper weird!
And somehow, he tricked Maud into liking him.
And now I'll never get to see her again!
[sighs]
I came home because you two know her better than anypony.
What am I missing?
What does she see in him?
[tearing up]
What does he have that I don't?
[sniffs]
It's just that I love Maud, and I want to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!
You mean that lumpy grey one?
I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, or white, but...
[laughs nervously]
Okay.
So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock!
It all makes sense!
No, wait.
It doesn't.
Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you!
I don't know what I'd do without you two!
Pie pile!
I really owe Mudbriar an apology.
[gasps]
And I owe Maud a party!
I just hope I'm not too late!
I brought you an olive branch to say sorry.
I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together.
Oh, come on!
[through gritted teeth]
Sorry!
Keeping it together... Friends!
Now, do you have any ideas for the party?
It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea.
He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to.
[through gritted teeth]
Technically... You're right!
Sorry, but it's pie season and the pie orders are piling up.
Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!
As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr.
and Softpad are really concerned.
She called them rodents?
She called Smoky, Smoky Jr and Softpad... rodents!
Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?
Maybe a little too much.
Woo-hoo!
Confetti is ready!
Woo-hoo!
Three hundred twenty-seven.
Unless you just did.
Then it's three hundred twenty-eight.
[squee]
Yeah!
Forget my regular party cannon!
For princess-sized effects, we're gonna need Big Bertha!
What?
It's the perfect plan!
That's why I have something even better!
Wait for it... Whaaaat?
It's realistic!
The sun is just like a burning marshmallow!
And to make sure the show's a hit, I've whipped up the biggest, bestest, flashiest fake sun ever!
Why would untested magic fireworks that I bought in a back alley from Trixie at midnight be unsafe?
[blows]
You can't fly away now!
Look!
Ooh, ooh!
Okay, let me see.
One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?
Um, Rarity?
Fluttershy?
Spike?
This flowerpot?
Really?
I thought I was giving tours today.
Guess not.
Free day!
Whee!
Woo-hoo!
Hey!
Is this the shouting closet?
Because I've got a free day, and I'm totally up for some shouting!
[sniffs]
Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from?
Because it is really interesting.
Whooooo's ready for cupcakes?
Oh, they're not for you, silly.
They're for sharing!
First, say something nice like this.
Ocellus, you are a great listener!
Now you get to keep one cupcake and share one with another creature.
Ugh!
Learning friendship with your best friends... and cake!
[munches]
Yeah.
They usually go together like candy canes and stripes.
It's almost like they forgot they're friends.
Yay!
You're friends again!
I knew you would be!
Candy cane stripes forever!
Waaaait!
You forgot Starlight!
She needs a picture, too!
Count me in!
We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids!
And hide and seek!
Quick!
Find me!
[screams]
You found me!
Everypony, stop!
And smell these roses!
[sniffs]
Ahhh!
Oh, yeah!
[gasps]
Good point!
Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite!
Whoo-hoo!
You're it!
Hey, how'd you get ahead of me?
You're fast.
Aren't they back there?
Sure!
Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.
Oh-ho-ho.
This is one of your activities, right?
Like a friendship quiz?
It's the crystal tree that holds the Elements of Harmony.
Boom!
[imitates buzzer]
It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters.
Double boom!
Mm-hmm.
Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy.
And then we all grew super-long manes with all kinds of colors, and your castle grew out of the ground, and everypony was like, Whoa!
And then we sang this song about rainbows, and?
[gasps]
Fluttershy!
What's wrong?
[gasps]
What?
That can't be right!
Twilight, your schedule can wait!
Fluttershy's upset.
You know what, Twilight?
Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize you're the one ruining the retreat for your friends!
Then you've got a super weird way of showing it!
Twilight is so into her retreat that she doesn't even care if her friends are upset!
She just wants us to stay on schedule!
I never said that!
I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame.
Your plans are the most un-lamest!
This was... the worst... day... ever!
I say we take 'em with us!
Road trip!
Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us.
Thaaaaaaaat's me!
And a-one, and a-two, and a-I know what to do!
[inhales deeply]
Phew!
And that's with only a few days of practice!
Can you believe it?
Well, if you enjoyed listening to my playing half as I enjoyed playing my playing, then I should totally play more!
That way, we'll be even!
There's a chance I may have missed a note or two here or there, but I just love playing so much!
[sighs]
You complete me.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
But if you're done...
And a-one, and a-two, and a-I know what to do!
[inhales deeply]
[inhales deeply]
[inhales deeply]
Phew!
Huh, that's weird.
I coulda sworn this place was packed a second ago.
Hey, guys!
Can I favor you all with a tune?
I take requests!
You mean the thing I love more than anything else in Equestria?
My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything?
Ooh!
Tell me, tell me, tell me!
Yeah, she was awful!
But that's kind of a random thing to bring up.
I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing.
[upbeat]
Why didn't you just say so?
Why?
It's just a silly instrument.
Well, lunch break's over.
Gotta get back to the bakery.
Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves!
[whistles gleefully]
No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!
No more yovidaphone playing for me.
And a-one, and a-two, and I don't know what to do.
Is it morning?
I hadn't noticed.
[sighs]
[sneezes]
[gulps]
[despondent]
Gimme another.
I said, gimme another!
[despondent]
I feel nothing.
[despondent]
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
[despondent]
Fine.
I'll move back to Ponyville.
[despondent]
That's what's wrong.
I thought coming here and listening to real yovidaphone playing would make me happy.
It makes me feel worse.
I'm never gonna sound like that.
If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can.
Whoops!
Sorry!
I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.
[sighs]
It sure does.
I mean... it did.
But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.
I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have issues with things that aren't perfect!
Like my playing!
Well, okay... If you all say so...
[clears throat]
Um, hi!
So, uh, any yaks here from out of town?
Ooookay.
And a-one, and a-two, and I-kinda-remember-what-to-do...
[inhales]
[gasps for breath]
Uhhh, I kinda wasn't expecting this.
You think so?
Even though it wasn't perfect?
Well if that's the case, lemme play you the song I just wrote two seconds ago!
It's called I've Got the Best Most Supportive Friends a Pony Could Ever Ask For!
It's a working title.
[inhales]
Pfft, well, yeah!
Eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird.
Why don't you find out?
Nice save, Twilight!
[squee]
I'm sorry for making us late.
Who would've guessed Xtreme Chocolate Airshow Cupcakes would take an x-tremely long time to bake?
[slurps, chomps]
Mmmm!
Quality confetti cannon work.
Sorry for making us late again.
Who would've guessed Scootaloo's super-difficult stunt special cupcakes would've been super-difficult to bake?
[chomps]
I'm not sure.
But I think it's surf's up!
Woo-hoo!
Cowabunga!
Wheeeee!
I tried that already.
Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but...
A pony with a metal shovel and a heart of gold?
Literally!
There's a hole and everything!
Sorry.
Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere.
Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship.
Ooh!
Did you visit Klugetown?
Hmm?
Woo-hoo!
You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic?
Why would we wa?
Ohhhh.
Riiiiight.
Hey!
I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.
[sniffs]
Ugh!
It smells just like it looks!
Don't worry, Twilight.
I got this.
Free pizza delivery!
Huh.
Always worked before.
Oh, well.
I don't feel like stone.
Unless it's really bouncy stone.
If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!
And you answered them?
Maybe there's a way to get out without magic.
Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!
I don't know.
Tartarus isn't so bad.
I could hang out here for a while!
Maybe not forever though.
Leave him to me.
Tirek's in!
All eternity!
There's your cue, you evil centaur, you.
Thanks for the assist, your redness!
Yay!
Twilight did it!
Yup!
I just love a good mysterious summons.
What's it about?
Do you think it's a surprise party?
Hey!
Why are we running?
Plus, I like it when you run so fast, the walls get all blurry!
Wheeee!
Yay!
Protectors of Equestria on three!
One... two...
Classic Twilight-ing.
And we still always win!
Like when Sombra almost took back the Crystal Empire, or when Chrysalis pretended to be Cadance, or when Tirek came back and absorbed all the magic, or the other time Chrysalis tried to take over, or with Cozy Glow and the school!
[inhales]
Am I missing anything?
What's his problem?
Cavalry's here!
[grunts]
That was fun!
Mmm... Cakewalk...
I vote for a cakewalk!
What are you looking at me for?
Sorry.
Nothing about this is funny to me.
Or those sweet little Cake twins...
I like digging!
[screams]
He made them bake a black licorice fruitcake that says Congratulations to Our Favorite Supreme Emperor King Sombra in green frosting!
It's the ugliest cake I've ever seen!
Well... With the Tree of Harmony gone, the Everfree Forest could grow out of control and threaten the town!
At least now we're back to just one problem!
Aw, everypony's all evilly!
What do we do, Twilight?
Yeah!
All we have to do now is defeat King Sombra!
[nervous laugh]
Oh, poodles!
Super odd dude.
I'm up for anything, as long as it's with all of you!
I was already in!
Come on, who doesn't want to hang with geese?
Yes, sir, Twilight, sir!
Yeah, it was fast-ish.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I know what I can do!
You're gonna need a lookout, so I can be your eye in the sky.
Too low, silly!
Up here!
[laughs]
What?
Just like space travel!
[giggles]
No, silly!
I'm dropping you two off as soon as we're close to the fans!
Then I'm going into space!
Canterlot!
We have a problem!
[screams]
They jumped out right before the balloon went [blows raspberries]
but that's all I could see without being in space, where I didn't get to go!
Probably several somethings.
[inhales, blows air]
Do you think they know we're here?
Yeah, especially after their team lost to us.
They must really love buckball.
Me, neither!
Unless you count a Royal Order of Party Planners Memorial Library, which I don't, because every party planner gets one of those eventually.
Ooh!
Then you'd better hurry.
Looks like there's already a line.
Ooh, so this is Quibble Pants.
Rainbow Dash told us all about how you two spent a whole Daring Do convention geeking out together about books!
Hee-hee!
[gasps]
Well, you've come to the right place.
Because if you asked me what my favorite part of the dance is, I'd say everything about the dance!
But especially... this!
The Fetlock lucky pot dinner!
You can cook anything you want!
Like, can I suggest, oh, I don't know, maybe... cupcakes?
Hmm, I'm not sure.
So, just in case, let's get baking!
Flour, milk, sugar, butter, icing.
Then we mix, and we beat, and we pour into pans.
We bake... And now you try it!
Well, that's one way to mix it.
She's really got it!
You'll be the hit of the ball!
[giggles]
Yona!
Are you all right?
I thought we were just teaching you how to have fun at the dance.
[slurps]
Ah, no biggie.
We could?
[gasps]
Ooh!
You should make a list of all the stuff you never tried but always wanted to!
There's a lotta little things out there to do!
Ooh!
That's not a terrifying level of responsibility or anything!
Yeah!
All we have left to do is polish the armor, bubble the punch, glitter the carpet, puff the pastry, float the floats, and carpet every road in Canterlot!
Should I keep reading?
Still mashing the guacamole!
I'm delegating!
[scoffs]
Yeah.
What is taking her so long?
[giggles]
Just kidding.
You guys really need to look behind you once in a while.
Not telling so much as showing.
In fact, what you're about to see may shake the very foundations of your perception for all time!
Yes!
But wait, there's more!
It's an invitation to visit the Cheese Sandwich Amusement Factory!
That's ridiculous!
They make way more there than just rubber chickens!
[giggles]
I am!
I can't wait to tour his factory, catch up, have him tell me my life's purpose, swap gag tips?
Uh, catch up?
I mean, it has been a while.
Oh, that.
Yeah.
It's just... All of you have found your thing.
You're gonna rule all of Equestria, Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, Fluttershy has her animal sanctuary, Rarity has her boutiques, Applejack has the hat...
And the farm!
So that's like... two things!
I don't even have one.
[sighs, chomps]
When I first got Cheese's invite, I was a little jealous.
It felt like even he was moving on to bigger and better things.
And everypony was leaving me behind.
But then I realized Cheese Sandwich is a party pony just like me.
If he figured out his purpose, he can help me figure out mine.
I know, silly.
That's why I'm going to visit Cheese Sandwich's factory so I can ask him to help me.
[chomps]
I am not!
[chomps]
Yup!
Anypony with a smile like that is exactly the kind of pony I want helping me!
Oh, hey, guys!
Pardon me?
Just gonna... squeeze by?
You sure can!
I'm here to see Cheese Sandwich!
Aw, that's a shame.
To think I came all this way because of this personal invitation from Cheese Sandwich himself.
Ooh!
Desolate-y!
Hello?
Anypony there?
[yelps]
Cheese!
I'm so happy to see you!
[strains]
I have a thought.
Who are you?
Wow!
A whole factory dedicated to gags!
Ooh!
I bet this is the funnest place ever!
Huh.
Maybe the fun is behind all this boring-looking factory stuff.
The squirting flower's a classic.
Ohhh!
What if the flower was part of a shirt, but the flower didn't squirt... the shirt did?
Oh, [giggles]
come on.
That's just off the top of my head.
You probably get, like, seventeen thousand ideas like that from Cheese every minute.
I think it's a whoopee cushion.
But what if you made the embarrassing sound come from somepony else?
So... which way is Cheese's office again?
What about Cheese?
Ohhh-ho-ho.
What if, instead of slipping, you were sticking?
One step on this banana peel, and you can't get it off!
[giggles]
That's funny!
Great!
Because he's exactly the pony I need to see!
Uh... hello?
Of course I did.
Your factory's... big.
It really seems like you found your purpose.
Which is perfect, since I came here for help.
Well, that's triple-perfect, because... uh, wait.
Why do you need my help?
[gasps]
You lost your laugh?
Is that some kind of joke?
Because it's not a funny one.
Riiiiight... Why don't we continue this discussion over some delicious canned peanut brittle, hmm?
[laughs]
Wow.
You did lose your laugh.
That's horrible!
Wait.
So you can tell if a gag is funny is not... you just can't laugh at it?
How did this happen?
I think I've got two words for you.
Knock... knock.
Boo.
Don't cry, because I'm gonna get you your laugh back!
Let's start with something small.
Excuse me, Mr Smirk.
But is there something in my... eye?
Why, thanks, Sans, ol' pal.
Put her there!
Sorry about that.
Let me make it up to you.
How about some... pie?
Come on!
Those classic bits put Rainbow Dash's funny bone in a cast for a week!
Hmmm... Maybe we need to start even smaller.
You can't run before you can walk, and you can't laugh before you can smile.
And your smiler's all out of whack.
Now let's see what we're working with.
Give me your biggest, bestest smile!
Almost...
[laughing nervously]
Maybe I just need to spot you for a rep or two.
Okay!
You got this!
It's all you!
Ready?
Awww... I'm not giving up on you yet, Cheese.
I know there's something somewhere that'll make you laugh.
I just have to figure out where to look.
How do you science funny?
I... guess that makes sense.
Rule of threes.
Hmmm.
One, two, three.
Yup.
That math checks out.
Hmmm.
At this point, I'm willing to give anything a try.
[groans]
I don't understand!
We've tried everything!
Stand-up, classic gag, physical humor, prop comedy, vaudeville, surrealist alt-scene character pieces... nothing's worked!
What do you mean?
[gasps]
So that's it?
You're all just giving up?
But... Cheese was just as funny as me.
I-I can't believe that's all gone.
You're not gonna close down, are you?
I thought this place was Cheese's life's purpose!
I need to find my life's purpose, but I don't think that's it.
I'm a party pony!
I need to make ponies happy in real-time!
Guess it's back to the drawing board.
Hold on.
What did you just say?
No-no-no-no.
Before that.
[groans]
That was me!
Yes!
That!
We've been going about this all wrong!
We don't need to make Cheese laugh.
He needs to make us laugh!
Cheese!
I figured it out!
I know why you can't laugh!
You started this factory because you didn't want to disappoint smiling faces.
But in here, you can't see any.
Except you don't see it.
You're a party pony like me.
You need to make ponies smile in-person!
Here.
Just try it.
Really?
Here.
Try me.
I promise I'll laugh.
Yeah!
Whatcha gonna do?
Shred it, Cheese!
Hey!
That's what I came here looking for!
Actually, I think I'm good.
...And then I said goodbye, and then I came here!
And then I gathered you all together and started telling you about it.
First, I said?
Yup.
But I think Sans Smirk's hooves were the perfect ones to leave it in.
As much as Cheese was born to wander Equestria and make ponies laugh in-person, Sans was born to run that factory.
Nope!
I figured out Cheese and I are pretty much the same.
We both need to see ponies laughing to feel fulfilled.
And I already do that.
My life is purposing itself all over the place!
Thanks.
I almost forgot!
I got you all a little something from my trip.
Who likes peanut brittle?
Always thought Celestia was kind of a jock, just with really wavy hair.
Mmmmaybe the School of Magic could play a few other schools first.
Like the Mane and Tail Styling College or the Scroll-Making Institute?
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
I can't wait to see the cheer squad!
Woo-hoo!
Go, team!
This is so exciting!
I know I said I couldn't wait to see the cheer squad, but maybe I could've waited just a teensy bit longer.
Don't worry!
Celestia's team might be tough, but we can still win this thing!
Sometimes, that's just how the cupcake crumbles.
Sure sounded like a joke to me!
[giggles]
Woo-hoo!
Present!
Twilight!
It's you and me!
Isn't that great?
Twilight!
I can't believe we're partners for a game!
I love games!
And I'm super duper excited for this game because it'll be my first time ever playing, and I get to play with you, which makes it even funner!
Twilight and Pinkie Pie forever!
Ooh!
We could be Team Twinkie!
Or [gasps]
Team Pink-Light!
[gasps]
Sparkle Pie!
No-no-no-no!
[gasps]
Twi-Pie!
[squee]
You don't have anything to worry about.
I'll do everything I can to be the bestest and most funnest teammate ever.
Let's get this party started!
[giggles]
The answer is nopony!
Because everypony ends up loving the holiday with singing, festive cakes, and thoughtful presents!
[laughs nervously]
Sorry.
I didn't know we could have negative points.
Can do, Coach Twilight?
Got it.
[whimpers]
Sitting still, sitting still, sitting still...
[continues under]
What?
Apples, apples, apples, apples...
Ooh, and oranges.
And grapes!
And strawberries.
[gasps]
Strawberry cupcakes!
I'm hungry.
[gasps]
Quiet down there.
Pretty sure there's a rule against tummies ringing in.
Look, Twilight!
No more belly growl interruptions for Team Twi-Pie!
[chomps, gulps]
[gasps]
[gasps]
Twilight!
I know all about those!
You have to let me help!
Where?
Wait, what?
Hey!
I knew that!
I made those cupcakes!
I guess that makes sense, but which way did that confetti parade go anyway?
Don't worry, fellow Twi-Pie.
I grew up on a rock farm.
I'm sure I know some of these.
The black one!
Yeah, that one!
We both get points, right?
You got it!
Hey, Maud!
What's the name of the famous rock in Griffonstone?
Sure I can.
I just did.
What?
What?
I-I can't believe I'm disqualified!
[whines]
Oh, no!
If I'm out, you don't have a partner!
You won't be able to get your third win!
Okay.
Um, I'll just cheer you on from... over there.
[scoffs]
I knew you wanted to win, but I probably could have helped a little.
And even if I couldn't... That doesn't sound like you at all!
I-I don't know.
Oh, it's not that.
It's just that I already changed it to Team Twi-Burst, and now I guess I should change it to Sun-Doodle?
[chomps]
Wow.
These rules are really convoluted.
But doesn't starting from zero mean we'll lose?
Something like this could definitely send you into full freaky-outy mode!
Step away from the wagons!
Official food-tasters here on official food-tasting business!
[chomps, gulps]
[chomps, gulps]
But I see a suspicious-looking cookie!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Let's just fix it all before she notices.
No lying necessary.
Even if I was an actual doctor, I would have no idea what's wrong.
I ate the food, too!
Does that mean I'm sick?
Oh, nooo!
[coughs]
Nope!
I feel fine.
[chomps]
Yes!
I... was really hungry?
Until it totally wasn't.
[giggles]
A brand new holiday?
You're my kind of princess!
Whee-hee!
Sorry!
I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats.
Ohhhh!
So that's how it works!
Do not go in that kitchen!
For some reason, the bakers are super grouchy with each other.
That unicorn chef started throwing dessert at Mrs Cake!
I tried to help, but I got caught in the crossfire!
Tasty, tasty crossfire.
[slurps]
Then we'll stop 'em!
Surprise attack!
You always do!
They put up a crazy fight so we could escape and find you!
Mission accomplished!
Now let's save Equestria!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!
But we're still free and together.
That's true pretty much every time something terrible is about to happen.
What are we gonna do, Twilight?
Step right up, evil fillies and gentlevillains!
Try your luck!
Missed me!
Close, but no cherrychimichanga!
[laughs]
Thanks for playing!
We told you you had it all figured out!
Hmmm... Tingly.
Itchy.
Also like... I COULD TRANSFORM THE COSMOS SO EVERYTHING IS MADE OF ICING!
Waiter! There's some chaos in my soup!
We're gonna need a lot more chairs for the coronation!
[eating noisily]
Mmmm!
Worried?
Pfft!
No way!
After everything we've been through?
No way.
Unless you're talking about the coronation, because then yes.
Obviously the cakes are handled, but there's the whole rest of the party to stay on top of.
And honestly, I'm not convinced Gummy really took care of the fireworks.
Well, since I'll be in charge of all the Canterlot galas from now on, I'll have to go there a lot more.
So I guess that's different, but I don't think I mind.
I'm going with Gummy.
He said he knows when the fireworks display should start, but does anypony really believe that?
What could possibly make you think that?
Me, too.
I'm going to miss you so much!
The only thing I'm worried about is Gummy handling the fireworks display.
But I'm sure it's fine.
[nervous laugh]
[gulps]
Well, at least the coronation is over.
[snickers]
It's a book of memories.
You're 'nervicited'!
It's like you wanna jump up and down and yell YAY ME!
But you also wanna curl up in a teeny-tiny ball and hide at the same time!
We've all been there!
Sparkly!
[squee]
Oooh!
I'm so 'nervicited'!
Incoming!
[breathes in and blows into a balloon]
[gasps]
Are you psychic?
[sigh]
Not usually.
Fluttershy, huh?
Don't let the whole shy thing fool you.
She can be a real meanie.
Waited a bit to get your name on the ballot, huh?
Dance is day after tomorrow.
Oooh!
I thought you didn't look familiar.
Though, now that I'm really lookin' at you...
Do you have a twin sister who lives in the city, has a pet dog named Spike that looks just like that one?
Thought so.
Anyhoo, just need to fill this out and you are officially up for the coveted Princess of the Fall Formal crown.
Wow!
You have really bad handwriting.
It's like you've never held a pen before.
Me, me-me-me, me, yeah, ha-ha, me!
Twilight Sparkle here is gonna run against Sunset Shimmer for Princess of the Fall Formal.
She's the captain of, like, every team at Canterlot High.
That one's tryin' to hide a secret, but I am totally on to her.
She's psychic!
Not this time.
The new girl just signed up!
I know.
Her handwriting is really bad.
Me three!
I like your new look!
What?
Oh, it's really not that bad.
[laughing nervously]
I take that back.
It's pretty bad!
If ya still wanna run, maybe there's something I can do to help!
Ugh!
Why do you have to be so awful to me?
And what is that supposed to mean?
Mm-hmm.
What are you talking about?
I got a text from you saying that you didn't want a silent auction.
You wanted a big party!
You didn't?
I never sent you any e-mails!
Hugs!
Ooh, hugs are always good!
WHAT!
WHAT?
Wha?
You're from an alternate world and you're a pony princess there and the crown actually has a magical element embedded in it that helps power up other magical elements, and without it, they don't work anymore, and you need them to help protect your magical world, and if you don't get the crown tonight, you'll be stuck in this world and you won't be able to get back for, like, a really, really long time!
[squee]
Just a hunch.
If I only had some kind of... party cannon that could decorate everything super fast!
Yes, indeedily!
This... looks... sooooo... GOOD!
Oh, bummer!
I knew you could do it!
Did ya have fun?
Totally reminds you of a guy you met in the other world who played guitar, was in a band, and helped prove you didn't destroy all the decorations for a big dance, so you could still run for princess of the big dance, and then asked you to dance at that dance?
[big breath]
Right?
Just a hunch!
How about this one?
Lookie here!
Super groovy!
No, silly!
If you want it, you have to pay for it.
I guess I could fold a little faster.
I'll bet!
[squee]
Oh, of course not.
Totally!
Absolutely!
Whaaaaaaat?
Or you could play this!
It's part guitar, part keyboard!
It's a guitarkey!
Po-tay-to, to-mah-to.
[gasps]
Wowee!
And she does play the bass!
Sunset Shimmer!
Over here!
And it smells like cake!
I used frosting instead of paste!
And tried to turn everyone here into teenage zombies for your own personal army!
One, two, three!
Yep!
Like, off like this?
Or off like this?
Or... Oh, oh!
Like?
Ohhhh.
They're that kind of off.
Not everybody!
Not the sirens!
[whispering loudly to Fluttershy]
I don't actually know what that is!
Okay, first of all, if there was bubble-blowing going on, why wasn't I told about it?
And secondly, if the connection is totally cut off, how was Sunset Shimmer able to get a message to Twilight?
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Now about those bubbles... Duh!
She's gonna take the magic in here and put it in there.
That'll make the portal open up so that whenever she wants to, she can go from here to there.
There to here.
Here to there.
Here there!
Here there!
Here?
[squee]
[sips milkshake]
[sighs]
There's a big party tonight for all the bands who signed up to be in the showcase!
That would include the Dazzlings.
[squee]
So what do you wanna play?
Triangle?
Sousaphone?
Theremin?
Soooo magical.
Are you crazy?
We're besties now!
Slumber party at my house!
Status update: Okie-dokie-lokie.
Pizza's here!
Don't you want any pizza?
She just wants to make things fun!
Isn't that what being in a band supposed to be?
[plays rimshot angrily]
Wait!
Where's Rarity?
One!
Two!
Ugh!
Says the girl who was running from a light the whole time!
A light!
She's gone!
[pause]
Oh, wait.
There she is.
Did they just say, the Rainbooms?
Seriously?
We didn't even finish our?
Hey!
Anybody here remember fun?
I'll give you a hint: It's the exact opposite of being in the Rainbooms!
We're getting the band back together?
Whee!
Awesome!
She's gone!
[pause]
Oh, wait.
There she is.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Hey, Rainbow!
You said we needed to be sneaky while we check out the competition for the Friendship Games.
Wanna see what else I have?
Cat burglar!
Dog burglar!
Tree!
Bunny suit!
Camouflage!
Best view in the house!
You smell like vanilla.
Ooh!
I have just the thing!
Bush to Dash.
Code red.
You have been spotted.
RUUUUUUUUUUUNNN!
Has a giant cake monster covered all the cakes in the world in cake?
Ooh, ooh!
A nighttime statue cleaner?
A magical portal maintenance maintainer?
A gardener?
Unless it's a losing to Crystal Prep competition!
'Cause we're really good at that!
Pie eating?
Cake eating?
[gasps]
Pie-cake eating?
Seems like she's got everything under control.
Nothing to worry about.
She doesn't!
That Twilight is obviously the Twilight from this world since it couldn't possibly be the Twilight from the pony world since the Twilight from the pony world doesn't go to Crystal Prep or wear glasses.
Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie!
I know.
You look just like my friend.
Her name is Twilight too.
What's that?
Like the party?
I know.
Something is definitely missing.
Come on!
Party cannons, of course!
Absolutely!
Ooh, floaty!
I am party pooped.
Yeah, she's awful.
I don't know.
Everyone started having fun after Twilight and I fired the party cannons and I ponied up.
But then the magic just drained right out of me.
She's right... Uh, well, she was right here.
Like me at the party!
Which is too bad, because Twilight knows everything about magic and portals and magical portals and portable magics!
[gasps loudly]
Whee!
Wow!
That's a lot to take in when you say it all at once.
[squee]
[slurping drink]
Don't you have a super-annoying alarm clock that goes [imitates alarm clock buzzer]
We can't stop, silly!
We're not there yet!
We are gonna have so much fun!
We're gonna roast marshmallows and eat marshmallows and sleep on marshmallow pillows!
Maybe you're not.
I'll say!
We fought three evil sirens who tried to hypnotize everybody with their singing, one ridiculously competitive rival school, and two demon friends!
Uh, heh-heh, no offense.
Cookie decorating!
[slurps]
A little.
Oh, boy!
Hmm... Yay!
I'm in the Emerald Tent!
This is gonna be so much fun!
Yes!
Adult supervision!
S'mores!
[with mouth full]
Our lips are sealed.
[gasps]
You don't think it was the spirit, do you?
And I was all, You need more sprinkles!
And you need more sprinkles!
I was just tossing sprinkles to Fluttershy, when all of a sudden they glowed pink and exploded!
Just like that, only earlier!
[gasps]
Being at camp is giving us all new magical abilities!
Abso-tootly-lutely!
Putting marshmallows in my lantern.
Then when we light them, mine will be beautiful and delicious!
Oh, well!
Now I get to eat it!
[chomps]
Yep, beautiful and delicious.
You don't think it was the spirit, do you?
Oh, here you go!
What?
Ohhh, did you think the nails would explode like the sprinkles?
Wow!
Glad that didn't happen, huh?
Oooh, fancy!
Try me, try me!
La-la-la-la.
Ooh, taffy!
Yep.
Uh-uh.
Freaky-deaky!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
This is gonna be so much fun!
I only wish we had time to make superhero capes!
Let's celebrate!
To the right!
To the right!
To the left!
To the left!
Now up!
Now up!
Bring it down!
Spin it around!
Wash that car like you mean it!
Come on!
Woo-hoo!
Hee-hee!
Whee-hee!
Great idea, Applejack!
[imitating synth drums]
It's really fun!
[imitating synth drums]
I haven't stopped this whole time!
[pants]
We're here!
[gasps]
Major bummer in the summer!
Tissue for your issue?
You can say that again!
[chomps, gulps]
Want some?
[chomps]
I think it's working!
Okay!
I've got it!
We'll start out on... the moon!
And we'll be wearing really sparkly costumes.
No, wait!
We'll be in spacesuits!
We're surrounded by gorgonzola cheese!
But then, a space doggie walks over and start to eat the cheese!
Aw, why not?
But they were pretty funny, huh?
[giggles]
I liked yours, Rainbow Dash.
Best!
Music!
Video!
Idea ever!
Who's up for a celebratory Aunt Orange smoothie?
And the cupcake fountain!
Of course they do.
I read it in my 100 Things You Didn't Know About This Movie Studio: Insider's Tour Guide.
Yes!
[sighs]
Three lunch buffets, six different kinds of fondue, two rooms with nothing but candy, and still no cupcake fountain!
Oh, well.
At least we found those peanut butter praline crunch bars!
They weren't in my guidebook, but they sure were delicious!
Maybe she's just really mad that they're always running out of her imported butter praline crunch bars.
Those are the ones!
Let's do it!
But we did find a cupcake fountain!
[chomp]
[gasps]
Are you kidding?
This is the set of Stormy with a Side of Pudding!
[grunts]
It's only my all-time favorite movie!
I've tried to get you all to watch it, like, a kazillion-billion times!
I've heard they use real pudding!
[tastes]
Oh, they do!
[slurp]
I know how to find Rainbow Dash!
Follow the pudding!
See?
I know!
Eh, for the road!
There's no more pudding.
Which means she must be here somewhere.
Pudding never lies.
[crunches]
What's the matter, Sunset Shimmer?
C'mon!
Share your troubles.
It might help soothe your stressed nerves.
I said spill it, SunShim!
Look!
Twilight's writing you back!
Hey, everybody, Sunset's getting an Equestritext!
Juniper Montage?
Were you invited to the Daring Do premiere?
Ooh, that's exciting!
No, crazy!
No, concerning!
Just no!
No offense.
Pinkie Pie's on the case!
Nope, no wall over here.
Come out, come out, walls, wherever you are!
I don't get this place!
There's no walls in here anywhere!
On the upside, there's popcorn in here!
[crunch, crunch]
Mmm, sticky... Dibs!
Hooray!
We're all together again!
How would she know where?
Ohhhh!
Twilight!
Wow!
We are a really forgiving group!
Yeah!
Jazz it up!
All right!
Emergency trophy in the event of an epic dance-off.
Thanks for joining my cheering club, Fluttershy!
What better way to spend a bee-you-tee-ful Saturday?
I just know that when the teams at CHS hear our voices, they're gonna be so totally super-duper pumped and win everything!
We just need some rah-rah and some oomph!
Every cheer counts.
Watch this!
Woo-hoo!
All right, Wondercolts!
See?
[through bullhorn]
All right, fans of Canterlot, you Fanterlots!
I wanna hear you cheer!
When I say Wonder, you say Colts!
Wonder!
Wonder!
When I say Blue, you say Goal!
Blue!
Blue!
All right!
Come on, Fluttershy!
We can't stop now!
We're on a goal roll!
[through bullhorn]
Okay, you Wondertones!
When we say Sing, you say Song!
Sing!
Sing!
When I say Jazz, you say Hands!
Jazz!
Jaaaaaazzzz!
Wow!
That sounded great, Wondertones!
I think our cheering worked again!
C'mon!
Another team needs us!
Hey!
You guys wanna join?
To the gym!
You betcha!
Here.
You need this more than me.
When I say Play, you say Yay!
Play!
Play!
[inhales]
Plaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy!
That's checkmate!
Woo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!
[sighs]
[giggles]
You're not a pet, silly!
I just don't know!
There are so many splendiferous things I could paint, but I'm drawing a blank!
You're absolutely right, Sunset Shimmer!
[slurps]
[sighs]
Still no ideas.
Are you sure that these are the creative juices?
Sunset Shimmer said that all the greatest artists find inspiration in nature.
Maybe this will help me think of something.
[sighs]
[sighs]
Nope.
Ooooh!
You birdies are right!
I have to get even more in tune with nature to really be inspired by it!
Chirp!
Chirp!
[sighs]
Pleh!
There's nothing more inspirational than a sweet tune or a bangin' beat!
And a one, two, a one-two-three!
Woo-hoo!
What?
But I do have a tummy full of fruit juice, feathers in my hair, and a headache!
Heh.
Of course!
I've got it!
It's been right in front of me all along!
Woooo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!
When you said to paint a subject that's totally awesome and makes me happy, I thought of something right away!
Ta-da!
I painted you, Sunset!
Do you like it?
Aah!
Thank jellybeans you three are here!
It's Gummy!
He's... missing!
I brought him here to see the Daring Do movie again because it's his favorite.
I love the part when Daring Do swings in on the vine and defeats the band of howler monkeys before breaking into the volcano fortress!
I went to buy some candy and some more candy, and poof!
He was gone!
You haven't seen him?
Oooh!
Mortal peril!
[mouthful]
Oh, there you are, Gummy!
Come on, you silly gator!
[giggles]
We have a movie to watch!
[giggles]
Thanks again!
Uh-oh!
Good one, Maud!
Ready for what we planned with Maud?
[gasps]
Look at Maud!
She's ecstatic!
Is this yours?
That's what we were waiting for?
I just thought we were having a super-duper fun line party!
I pre-ordered it for you weeks ago.
Ah, no biggie-wiggie!
I love kids!
Hi, Lily!
Welcome to the best babysitting bash on the block!
I have all sorts of super-fun stuff for us to do!
Do you want to... bake a yummy cake, or... make super-silly hats, or bake a silly hat-shaped cake?
Okay.
Boring!
So... what's the story about?
Then what happens?
Whee!
Woo-hoo!
Hmm?
Dessert Island!
[munches]
Want some?
Tell me more!
Pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch!
[squawks]
Pinkie want a cracker!
[squawks]
Whee!
[laughs, imitates monkey]
Rawk!
Pinkie want a cracker!
Rawk!
[pants]
Do I?
You're gonna make a terrific babysitter some day, Lily.
[snores]
Monkeys... pirates... Huh?
And our geodes will go all glowy if it's about to get whack-a-doodle-doo?
[screams]
The frolicking!
That's short for frosting licking!
I'm gonna get my hot little hands on the new dessert trend... the puff cake!
Half cream puff, half cupcake!
He went this-a-way!
It's everything I've dreamed of!
Woohoo!
Step on it, Granny!
If a tree falls in the woods and then gets sprinkle-blasted to bits, did it ever really exist?
Sorry!
I love your work!
Ooh!
Is it a love letter?
A secret recipe?
Or, wait.
Someone's trapped on a deserted island?
We have to save them!
Amazing!
Let's go!
The treasure is a treasure map!
Look!
There's a trail of shells!
Rainbow!
The treasure is a sushi truck!
That's amazing!
Ah... ah... tho thpithy!
[breathes fire]
[sighs]
Ooh-la-la!
Let me help!
Actually, how about I help us away from the crabs?
I could get us a snack!
There's still an hour until the shaved ice stand closes!
Cool!
I promise I'll be back before it starts!
Sparkly.
Hey!
Still works.
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
[growls]
Boingy, boingy, boingy!
Whee!
[laughs]
Nailed it!
Barely!
You'll never believe what I had to do to get these back un-melty.
[sighs]
Do you... want this?
I'm sorry, everyone.
I wanted to have enough to share.
Say, cheese sandwich!
Okay, once more with Gruyere!
A sea monster?
I gotta see it to believe it!
But I already believe it!
[squee]
Ooh!
Over here!
I'm ready!
I'm not ready!
Where's my floatie?
[gasps]
It's not only real!
It's right there!
My floatie!
[laughs]
Foiled again.
I knew you would come back to me.
I'm about ready for a snack.
Care to try a caramel cream puff?
What's in the trunk, Rarity?
At sea, nothing's accounted for.
Its tides are fierce yet sublime, as beautiful as they are chaotic.
Cast away!
Surrender to the seeeeeeeea!
[gasps]
A rock!
I mean, rock ho!
[grunts]
The ocean... vast, mysterious, wild.
We may never fully understand her, but nonetheless, she commands respect.
[chomps]
Ooh!
Salted caramel!
[gulps, slurps]
Ooh!
Rarity left her Canterlot Beat magazine here!
Ooh, look!
It even has a pop quiz!
Score your friendship levels: Are you BFFs for life?
Question 1: What's your best friend's favorite food?
That's only my third favorite food, behind cupcakes and regular cakes.
[munches]
No points.
Oh, well.
Next question: Favorite part of school.
It's... hmmm... Nope.
It's helping the janitor refill the snack machines.
Okay!
The score is still zero-zero.
Cool!
Same-sies!
Last question: What is your friend's biggest fear?
Actually, mine is clownfish, but I don't even wanna think about undecorated desserts.
[shudders]
We flunked!
Aw, it's just a silly quiz.
[gasps]
Twilight, your friendship equation!
[laughs]
I coulda told you that!
Snack Psychic
Welcome, girls!
Be back soon!
Big test?
When you're stressed, you always order grilled cheese.
[gasps]
Be right back!
Here!
Twi can help you.
She's basically a genius at everything.
Especially math.
I wanna introduce you to my friend Rarity.
That's why!
Chlorine!
And soup.
Aw, candy corn!
Eating soup after the big loss at the swim meet today?
That's not true!
Hold on.
I know just what you need!
First, you totally deserve nachos for trying!
And second... this is Rainbow Dash!
She's the captain of every single team at Canterlot High!
She's the best at turning today's loss into tomorrow's win!
Do what?
It's just a gut feeling, you know?
Welcome to The Craft of Cookies with me, Pinkie Pie!
In just one class, you, too, can become a Certified Cookie Master!
[gasps]
Let's get started.
[squee]
Yummy!
Yes, please!
Tasty!
You're gonna be delicious!
Now, step two... making cookies!
Cup of sugar, tablespoon of baking powder, dash of vanilla, pinch of salt, and for our final ingredient, two Tank kisses!
[smooches, slurps]
Mmmm... Cotton candy.
This is taaaaaasty!
You've really outdone yourself, Pinkie!
Aw, thanks, Gummy!
Now for the not-so-secret ingredient... chocolate!
[munches]
Mmmm... mmm... Don't eat all the chips!
Whoa.
My tum-tum.
I didn't think there was such a thing as too much chocolate.
[belches]
Now, to bake our creations!
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
[gasps]
They're ready!
[sniffs]
What's that, Gummy?
You think I've just invented the perfect cookie?
Awww...
And now, for the final, and best, part... sprinkles!
Et voila!
Two dozen ultra-scrumptious cookies for a sophisticated snack time!
Until next time on The Craft of Cookies, this is Pinkie Pie bidding you a sweet evening and a most delicious morrow!
Advanced physics?
[laughs]
Thank goodness!
I thought they had ruined P.
Rainbow Dash, I'm on my way!
Don't choose things without me!
Best class to have together ever!
No trouble, space rubble.
Stars are like the glitter of the sky!
Of course she will.
And I have to get this celestial celebration into orbit!
Woo-hoo!
Space party!
Hmm... Party cannon!
Atomic chocolate cake!
Mmm, sciency.
Cake fixes everything.
Best diner in Canterlot, ladies!
Not a single bad review!
Five-star rating on Screech!
Super happy with your flavor selection?
How about a review?
Yeah!
I thought you might.
That's what I like to hear.
Care to Screech about it?
Can I get you anything else?
Okie-dokie-lokie!
Hope you're enjoying your paper.
If you're enjoying your service, too, feel free to leave a Screech!
[whimpers]
We just got our first ever four-star review.
We're dooooomed!
We are a five-star diner!
I have to fix this!
Just in case the first one gets cold.
Complimentary piece of pie?
Complimentary whole pie?
Agh!
What am I doing wrong?
Fine.
I'll just leave you alone.
[gasps]
Ooh!
Party picture!
What filter?
Classic?
You mean like... confetti?
Confetti everywhere!
Hmm.
Classic Pinkie Pie.
Oops!
Sorry.
Hello, computer net friends.
Pinkie Pie here, bringing you the list you've all been waiting for.
Because anybody who's anybody knows that music festivals aren't about the music or the scene or even the camping.
Which is why we're counting down the five lines you need to stand in!
Oh, yeah!
First up, the security line.
If we play this right, we might just make a new friend.
You can show off all the cool stuff in your purse.
I know, right?
The only thing that tastes better than nachos is nachos you waited two hours to get.
Besides, how else could I ever decide what I want on them?
Which is everything!
Ohhhh, delicious!
Up next, the photo booth line.
Let's practice a pose!
Say cheese!
Say, cheese?
Eh, your loss.
Why not take a chance on a mystery line?
It could lead to the coolest place you've ever seen!
Do you know where this line goes?
Me, neither!
But if it's this long, it's got to be good, right?
[giggles]
Last, but certainly not least, is the bathroom line.
Or, as I like to call it, the conga line!
Cha-cha-cha, everybody!
This is the best line ever!
Congratulations!
You made it!
Party time!
Sweet 'Breev's!
Totes!
That's an 'abbrev'.
As in, I totes have no idea what you just said!
Woo-hoo!
Cupcakes!
Vanilla swirl!
Chocolate crunch!
Strawberry coconut!
Lemon drop!
Key lime!
Orange creamsicle!
Raspberry ganache!
Woo-hoo!
Confetti?
I love confetti!
And parties and cupcakes and surprises, but most of all... Confetti!
A party?
And I missed it?
Aw, shoot!
I was busy spreading the joy of confetti to the whole entire school!
Okay... Wheeee!
[giggles]
Let's all do the play together!
Aah!
It'll be like planning an amazing party where everything has to be perfect or we get embarrassed in front of the whole school.
Right, Fluttershy?
[squee]
How cool is chemistry class?
I can't believe I got to come up with my very own chemical formula... jalapeno supernova cupcake frosting!
[slurps]
Aw, you sound just like my lab partners.
Couldn't have done it without you guys!
You bet!
Ooh!
I know what we could do to get your mind off the play.
We could ask Rarity for a makeover.
Or ask Bulk Biceps for a massage.
He gives such good massages.
Or we could ask Applejack to whip you up an apple face mask.
Ah, there are so many options!
Maybe too many options?
It's kind of stressful just thinking about it.
Right?
Huh?
Where'd you go?
Twilight!
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
Take a look at this!
I made an anti-stress list.
You love lists, don't you?
Well, to start, this is a list of lists we could make.
We could make a list about color, a list about numbers, a list about buckets, lists?
Twilight?
Twilight?
Twilight!
I had a feeling you'd be here.
You're welcome!
I can't take it anymore!
It was me!
I did it!
I'm the one!
Huh?
It couldn't have?
I wasn't?
I was?
Mmm.
Yeah.
You were just so upset, I thought confessing would make you feel better.
Like, at the frozen yogurt shop, I took more than one free sample, and then I put the used sample spoons in the wrong cup.
And then someone took my spoon.
And I watched them, Rarity!
I watched them eat my yogurt germs!
Ohhh!
You mean that one under the pile of bell-bottoms?
But I have so much more to confess.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Pick me!
Me, too!
Pick me, pick me, pick me!
Party balloons!
You will make time, Sunset!
I mean, there's always time for balloons.
Ha ha!
Actually, they're the set.
Nope.
Nope.
See?
Balloons can do anything.
I am gonna practice my drum solo, silly.
A-one, two, three, four!
I can't hear you!
I'm busy helping!
Okay!
You got it!
Thank you, Canterlot High School!
What'd ya think?
Confetti?
I love confetti!
And parties and cupcakes and surprises, but most of all... Confetti!
A party?
And I missed it?
Aw, shoot!
I was busy spreading the joy of confetti to the whole entire school!
Okay... Wheeee!

Okay!

Thank you, Canterlot High School!
What'd ya think?
I always knew I liked you all, but now it's official!
In yearbook form!
The people have spoken!
Beach day!
I'll make my world-famous fun-in-the-sun cupcakes.
[whispers, to Fluttershy]
The secret ingredient is edible sunscreen!
It's SPF fun-hundred!
She was soooooooo mean.
No, I got it!
I got it!
[gasps]
Ocean monster!
Ocean monster!
[squee]
Nope.
You're awake.
[giggles]
Me, too!
[giggles]
The closest you've ever come to a party of mine is freshman year, when you pretended to be Applejack and texted me, Your party is lamer than a hungry duck in snow boots.
It really hurt my feelings.
ve been out here a while.
Time to reapply!
Bring it on, Rainbow Dash!
You and Rarity just bought your team a one-way ticket on the express train to You're Going Down!
Thanks!
I've been practicing all day.
Isn't that right, little baby camera?
You're in my house now!
[grunts]
Yeah, wait a minute!
Is this supposed to be me making such a ridiculous face?
I'd never fake a face like that!
Preposterous!
Fake, I say!
She was soooooooo mean.
[snores]
But after seeing what you did...
Yeah, yeah, we get it.
Light her up, ladies!
Somebody has unspilled beans at this table, and it's not me, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Twilight Sparkle, or Sunset Shimmer!
Equestria Land?
Wait... Will you get to go there for free?
Was it today?
Did I miss it?
[sips]
Obviously, the internet mailman gave you the wrong letter.
I know that's not how the internet works, but I'm trying to cheer you up.
Equestria Land opening day!
What should we do first?
Appleloosa Wild West Stunt Show?
Nightmare Moon's Haunted Castle?
Sugarcube Everything?
Ah, it's not a character, silly!
That's Vignette Valencia!
She's famous on Snapgab, which you'd know if you actually logged in once in a while.
You're missing my One Cupcake Every Day series.
I don't get it.
We sing songs together!
[whistles]
No frowning allowed!
Hmmm... As Fun Inspector, I'm a little concerned about what I'm seeing here.
No, silly!
Fun Inspectors are freelance!
And don't get paid!
And totally made up by me earlier today when I saw a little girl crying because she dropped her ice cream, and I said to myself, Pinkie Pie, this place isn't as fun as it could be!
Do you like the uniform?
I made it out of things I found in the trash, but you can't even tell!
Nope.
But I have seen my Deputy Fun Inspector!
Ta-da!
Now you have all access to the entire park, Deputy Fun Inspector!
[slurps]
I know you're stressed, Rarity, but I'm sure you've got something totally amazing up your sleeve!
You did remember to wear sleeves with amazing things up them, right?
Nuh-uh.
Applejack, she can hear you!
Rarity!
Uh... you?
Which is her name, by the way.
Not Applejuice.
Wait, you guys didn't know that?
[gasps]
Squish city!
Why are they clapping?
Do they even know what's going on?
People are saying that rainbow laser thing was the coolest light parade show they've ever seen!
Spring break!
Spring break!
SPRIIIIIIIIIING BREEEEEEEEEEAK!
Mmmm!
Smoothies!
[screams]
Twilight, this cruise has everything!
And a moving floor!
Ooh!
Honey walnut crisp!
Candy-coated cupcakes!
Banana sorbet delight!
[gasps]
Triple Choco-Berry Blasted Butter Biscuit Bundt Cake?
[squeals]
I waited my whole life to taste a cake like this!
NOOOOO!
[gasps]
CAKE OVERBOARD!
[sighs]
My whole life, I've been taught that you could only berry blast a butter biscuit on a bundt cake with two layers of chocolate.
But this afternoon, I saw the truth.
The buffet has a Triple Choco-Berry Blasted Butter Biscuit Bundt Cake.
I don't know!
'Cause Rainbow Dash got me banned from the buffet!
Yeah.
Do you mean when we turn into ponies or do you mean?
Awww, I hate seeing a party get shut down before its time.
Time to raid the desert buffet under cover of darkness!
Triple Choco-Berry Blasted Butter Biscuit Bundt Cake, here I come!
No one!
Shouldn't you be upstairs?
[slurps]
[squeals]
I don't think so!
[growls]
[sighs, gasps]
I'll help keep people calm!
Get cake.
I mean, keep people calm!
[squeals]
I don't think she heard you.
Applejack said to tell you she's about to reconnect the engine and we might feel a little jolt.
Oh, she didn't say.
We're running out of time!
Watch out for rocks!
Watch out for everything!
[screams]
You might not have to!
[gasps]
Rock ho!
To the lifeboats!
And there go the lifeboats.
That was a very specific lightning strike.
[gasps]
You're back!
[laughs, squeals]
While you were gone, we fixed the boat, but then we crashed into a rock, and we're sinking, so... we ruined your spring break!
[sobs]
Light it up, ladies!
Good thing I'm a slow learner.
Triple Choco-Berry Blasted Butter Biscuit Bundt Cake!
Is that everyone?
Who, PostCrush?
That's only because PostCrush is the craziest, most amazing-est pop duo ever!
PostCrush, PostCrush, PostCrush!
I see your point.
But we thought wrong!
Roll call!
K-Lo!
While Supernova Zap... is the zany one!
Not unlike another certain dynamic duo I know.
[giggles]
What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes?
Pinkie Pie!
Sunset, Sunset!
Look!
So many lines to stand in!
This day's already amazing!
Let's go!
You come to this line often?
Any other sweet lines we should hit up?
Aw, cheer up.
Lines fly when you're having fun!
See you in there, Sunset!
Secondary objective... win a tandem bicycle!
All I have to do is guess how many candies are in the jar.
And my sugar senses say... three hundred and five!
Awww.
Uh, this bike has two seats, Sunset.
That's one more than usual!
Fine.
I'll focus.
Oh, look!
The neon garden!
Whee!
Awww.
[gasps]
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I do!
I do!
[giggles]
Guess what!
I spilled paint, and it looks exactly like Rarity with a pirate mustache!
What?
It's washable.
You got it, Su?
Whoa!
[sniffs, gasps]
Puffed Pastry's exclusive star-crusted, cinnamon-dipped churros!
I will not give in!
[squeals]
I can't resist!
[laughs]
Our bad.
I'm really sorry.
I wish we could do the day all over again.
I'd do it different.
What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes?
Pinkie Pie!
Sunset, Sunset!
Look!
So many lines to stand in!
This day's already amazing!
You come to this line often?
Any other sweet lines we should hit up?
What do you want to do first, Sunset?
There's so much we can do!
Like... win a tandem bicycle?
All I have to do is guess how many candies are in the jar.
What are we waiting for?
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I do!
I do!
[laughs]
Awesome.
[laughs]
[giggles]
What?
It's washable.
Time loop!
[laughs]
Classic Sunset.
For more wishes?
Solid choice.
Seen crazier.
Wait.
Why didn't you see PostCrush?
Aw, don't beat yourself up.
I promise we'll see them together tonight, or so help me, I?
[sniffs]
What's that smell?
[sniffs]
Could it be?
[gasps]
Puffed Pastry's exclusive star-crusted, cinnamon-dipped churros!
Now's proooob'ly not the best time to go get one.
On the other hand, if I get two, then Sunset can have one with me.
I will not give in!
[slurps, whimpers, groans]
But I can't resist!
Whoa!
[laughs]
Our bad.
Maybe you'll get another another chance?
What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes?
Pinkie Pie?
Sunset!
Hey!
Wait up!
Hey!
[gasps]
Win a tandem bike?
Sunset!
Suuuunseeeet!
You found me!
Oh, okay!
Now I'll find you!
I'm having fun with my friend!
Whoa!
Sunset!
Sunset?
Sunset... are you... ditching me?
[whimpers]
Me lose track of Sunset?
Hah!
But she's been right here the whole time!
Right, actual Sunset Shimmer?
[imitating Sunset Shimmer]
Right, Pinkie Pie!
By the way, your roasting technique is flawless!
[laughs, normally]
Thanks!
What.
Are.
You.
Talking about?
Are you saying the calendar industry cooked up a conspiracy to make every day today just to save paper?
You're right.
It's too obvious.
I probably ask you this every day, but what did Princess Twilight say when you told her about this?
[giggles]
Seriously though, why didn't you?
Are you asking yourself, Self, how do you spend seventeen days with my best friend Pinkie Pie without asking for help until now?
What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes?
Pinkie Pie!
So you think Princess Twilight can help you with this temporal loop thingy?
Whoever has the Time Twirler is the only person besides you who isn't in the same place doing the same thing every day.
Have you noticed anyone who doesn't belong?
Anyone out of place?
Anyone... evil?
They must be a last-minute addition!
You're a V-important-P to me.
The weak shall crumble before me!
I got this!
Last summer, weren't you working at the, um... Cat food convention?
Oh, that's right!
Mm-hmm!
Uh, you were the guy who... Because, mmm... now, what happened again?
Was it an orange cat?
What was her na?
Ohhh.
I guess I don't got this.
[whimpers]
What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes?
Whoa!
Really?
Wow, thanks!
Great idea, Sunset!
Nice thinking.
Also, looks more like a tour van to me.
You got it!
No one's gonna get by me!
No way, no how!
Nuh-uh!
Nope!
Nah, nah-ah!
Keepin' watch.
That's what I?
[sniffs]
What's that smell?
[sniffs]
Could it be?
[gulps, gasps]
Puffed Pastry's exclusive star-crusted, cinnamon-dipped churros!
[whimpers]
Now's probably not the best time to go get one.
On the other hand, if I get two, then Sunset could have one with me.
I will not give in!
[swoons, slurps]
No, no, no!
So good...
[whimpers]
I, uh... just wanted to say the Dazzlings are back, but I see you see they see you seeing them, and you've seen me too, so, um... see ya.
Cool tour bus!
It's okay!
Did you convince the Dazzlings to break the time loop?
Well... I'm gonna find a nice line to wait in so I don't ruin it for you again.
[sobs]
You deserve to have a good day, Sunset.
What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes?
A line?
This day's already amazing!
[gasps]
Win a tandem bicycle?
All I have to do is guess how many candies are in the jar.
And my sugar senses say... three hundred and five!
Awww.
Whee!
[laughs, gasps]
Oh, Sunset!
[gasps]
This is the best day ever!
And now, for the grand finale!
Post?
[sniffs]
What's that smell?
[gasps]
How did you know?
[sniffs]
Awwww.
[giggles]
I know!
[eating noisily]
See what happens when you embrace the chaos of our friendship?
Ooh, I hope they like us!
You must've met them on one of the other days.
Tell me what happens!
We are huge, huge, ginormous fans!
Of course!
We don't want to keep you.
Come on, Sunset.
At least we'll be together.
[sighs, sniffs]
What's that smell?
[sniffs]
Could it be?
[gasps]
Puffed Pastry's exclusive star-crusted, cinnamon-dipped churros!
Churros is magic!
We get it!
Weren't about to, either!
What's wrong?
[scoffs]
Are you kidding?
They trapped my best friend at a super fun music festival without me for weeks!
They are so going down!
Sorry to interrupt, buuuut... Yup!
You just gotta make the best with what you've got!
[squeals, giggles]
Churros... Nom-nom-nom...
[gasps]
Yes!
We did it!
[laughs]
Woo-hoo!
What do you wanna do today, Sunset?
Yeah, I guess it would've been!
[blowing up a balloon]
Whoa!
Whoa!
Heads up, Fluttershy!
Out of control balloooooon!
[screams]
I bet they loved it!
Twilight, look at me!
This will be the biggest celebration Equestria has ever seen!
As the Princess of Friendship, you cannot fail!
This day will define who you are!
The pressure is intense!
It's almost too much for any single pony to handle!
[screams]
But you have us!
So stop worrying.
Oopsie!
Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more fine tuning!
Ooh!
I bet those are the clowns I ordered!
...Or definitely not the clowns I ordered.
We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever!
Yeah, the Queen!
Uh, what queen?
I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size.
Huh, but they're always hungry.
Indeedy!
Let's go find this hippo!
Hehe!
Whee!
[giggles]
Whee!
Boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy!
Anypony up for a game of I Spy?
No, really!
Come on!
I spy with my little eye something that is orange.
No takers?
It's you, Applejack!
[giggles]
There's sand in my... everything...
Heh... Saving... Equestria... [demented laugh]
Look!
Maybe this guy knows which way to go!
What's that, friend?
We're lost?
[demented laugh, coughs, faints]
Oooh!
A city!
[scoffs]
We are doing it, you guys!
Can I have your attention please?
Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos?
Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend?
How about this comb that I've never used?
A picture of my sister Maud?
This breath mint?
Seriously, buddy.
Help me help you.
Relax, Twilight!
I totally got this!
[laughs]
We could definitely use a friend out here!
Ooh!
So many fun breakables!
Yessirree!
The Queen of the Hippos!
You mean the mountain right outside the window?
Yay!
Woo!
[screams]
[screams]
Best... escape... plan... ever!
Ooh!
I met that guy in the desert!
Rainboom!
Rainboom!
Rainboom!
Rainboom!
Whoa!
[screams]
[screams, laughs]
Whee!
Whee!
Whee-hee-hee!
That was fun!
Can we do it again?
Ooh!
No Hippogriffies here!
Or here!
Or here!
Or here or here or here!
Waaaaaiiit!
Nope!
This place is emp-ty!
Hey!
Wait up!
Cannonball!
[sputters]
She's gone!
Huh?
Way to leave it to the last minute, Twilight!
Woo-hoo!
[giggles]
Ooh!
Try it, Fluttershy!
[gasps]
[giggles]
I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was.
Couldn't we stay for just a little longer?
[squee]
I won't let you down!
[giggles]
Ahhh!
'Cept it wasn't!
The Queen was going to say yes!
We did what you told us and that's what made her realize we were ponies worth saving!
[gasps]
Unless... You didn't really want us to show her the best time ever!
You just wanted us to distract her!
No, Twilight!
We stuck together!
We were gonna get the help we needed!
The only thing that stopped us... was you!
You're also the only one who doesn't trust her friends!
[gasps]
[sniffles]
I just can't talk to you right now.
Ahhhh!
We're coming, Twilight!
As soon as we bake up a plan!
Okay!
[whimpers]
Surprise!
Double surprise!
Whee!
[laughs]
[gasps]
Excellent idea, Rainbow Dash!
Just do it!
Thank you!
I'm excited!
Who's excited?
Aaah!
I've never been so excited!
[laughs]
Whee!
Bull's-eye!
I'm sorry, too.
Friends mess up sometimes, but we never should've?
You've got this, Twilight!
Whee!
Twilight!
Nooooooooooo!
[sobs]
[gasps]
Yay!
Group hug!
[squeals]
Nice touch, Tempest!
Oooh!
What is it?
[gasps]
Okay!
That is the most awesome name ever!
Ooh, a game of chance!
Tell me more.
A dash of mystery.
Good.
Good.
Wait.
So instead of lots of presents, I only buy one of you a present?
What kind of game is this?
[sighs]
Fine.
I will only buy one present for my secret Hearthswarming Helper buddy.
So excited!
Aah!
Too excited!
I don't wanna give anything away!
Wheeee!
I have no idea what to get my pony!
Those were for when I was getting all of my friends matching harmony Hearth's Warming hats!
Now it's just Twilight!
[sobs]
I can't give one pony a matching present with nothing to match it!
I need something special for only her!
I don't think Twilight likes rocks as much as you do, Maud.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Gummy.
But this is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced!
Uh, this one's for you.
Hey!
This is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced!
How exciting is that?
Am I up for the challenge?
I know I'm good at gift-giving, but am I the best at gift-giving?
Marble, you're a genius!
Yaks would say they're the best at gift-giving!
If anypony knows what to do, it's them!
I gotta go to Yakyakistan!
Thanks!
These Pie sister talks are the best!
I don't have Rarity!
Guess who!
No, silly!
Nope-ity, nope, nein, and nyet!
It's me!
Yaks best at everything!
That's why I'm here.
Sorry to interrupt Snilldar Fest, but I need help.
Can you tell me where to find... best gift ever?
[echoes]
Honorary yak friend listening.
[gasps]
What?
How am I gonna figure out how to give Twilight the best Hearth's Warming gift ever?
My lips are sealed.
Time for my top-secret quest to the Gift Givers!
Aah!
Are you sure you were expecting me?
My name is?
Who are you reindeer?
Ooh!
And you can help me give Twilight the best gift ever?
Well, that was?
Ooh!
I like that box!
[gasps]
The perfect gift!
Wow!
I don't get it.
Uh... Did you get attacked by a party?
[screams]
Uh, maybe leave the baking to me next time.
Actually, it's pretty good.
Now, that's an impressive dessert!
Really?
That's so thoughtful.
Gingerbread?
Four more candy canes?
I don't get it.
Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight!
I'm your Hearthswarming Helper!
What?
With no pudding disaster, my gift with the exact ingredients wouldn't have made any sense.
This way, it was perfect!
Ooh, ooh!
The Gift Givers told me that!
Oh, what was it?
The best gift is more precious than gold, but it cannot be sold.
When it breaks, it's not ended, for quickly it's mended.
It can never be bought yet is easily sought.
What's so funny?
Mmmm!
Don't you just love Granny's Hearth's Warming fruitcake?
Uh, what's wrong with her?
Wow.
There's Triple Pony Dares, and then there's just impossible!
Find a Triple Pony Dare champion forever yet?
[gasps]
I just figured out how to settle this whole thing!
Uh-huh.
I Triple Pony Dare you... to quit daring each other!
Guess that means... I'm the winner!
I win!
I win!
I win!
Uh-huh!
Oh, yeah!
[giggles]
Welcome to my amazingly amazing escape room!
You amazed?
Oh, it's sooo much more.
Holiday clues, puzzles, and riddles are hidden everywhere!
And until you solve them to find the key... We're locked inside!
Good!
'Cause if we don't get out of here in time, something super big and really scary is going to happen!
I don't remember.
Uh-huh.
Then I made sure to forget everything so I can play, too.
Whee!
Why not try both?
[whistles]
We're having fun!
All of them!
[squee]
Yay!
And time's up!
And you didn't find the key, so get ready.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, yeah!
That's what it was!
Woo-hoo!
Wasn't that sooo much fun?
Never fear!
Pinkie Pie is here!
Special delivery from Zecora!
That's what I said.
Anyhoo, Zecora promised this potion will cure Twilight!
Except... there may be some teensy-eensy side effects.
Kite-flying time!
Woo-hoo!
Wow!
Twilight really likes her new kite.
But why does she keep yelling at it to stop looking at her?
Step right up, everypony, to the coolest attraction in all of Equestria!
[slurps, giggles]
And I mean cool.
This show is cooler than a snow sandwich in Yakyakistan.
What icy treasures await you ponies behind this very curtain?
I'm glad you asked.
'Cause I've got the scoop!
A big one!
Presenting the one, the only... Sugarcube Corner Ice Cream Museum!
The Sugarcube Corner Ice Cream Museum is the only place where you can learn about the history of ice cream and admire whatever flavor you favor!
[giggles]
Come on, everypony.
Revere the rocky road!
Commend the cookie dough!
Marvel at the mint chip!
And don't forget to take a dip in the rainbow sprinkle pool!
It's so beautiful!
Be delicious!
That's right, Mrs Cake!
Because there's tasting spoons for everypony!
You get a spoon, and you get a spoon, and you get a spoon, and you get a spoon!
What could top that, you ask?
Go on.
You ask.
Toppings!
Jimmies, gummies, crumbles, jumbles, sprinkles, pickles...
[gasps]
And that's just the first row!
[gasps]
Tell me, Cranky.
What flavor of ice cream are you most excited about?
Well, you're in luck!
'Cause this museum's got that, too!
Now, who's ready to chill out with me?
Welcome to... The Sugarcube Corner Ice Cream?
[gasps]
Soup Museum?
[slurps]
Mmmm!
[gasps]
Melted is my new favorite flavor!
Road trip!
Okay, not technically a road trip, because we're taking that.
Uh-huh.
Whoa!
Nope!
I'm gonna beat you!
Whoa!
I'm gonna beat you!
Eep!
Yeah?
Well, I was fifth!
[giggles]
Aw, yeah!
Yeah!
It's supposed to be a nonstop fun-o-rama party!
Bye-bye!
Bakery and karaoke?
It's like they see into my soul!
Plus, we get to watch the mayor give Rainbow Dash an award!
I call dibs on the cheering section!
[squeals]
Yeah!
It's gonna be one long party, which starts... now!
I spy with my little eye... a rainbow!
No, I really do spy a rainbow!
[coughs]
Uh-huh!
[reading sign]
Welcome to Hope Hollow: Home of the Famous... Rainbow Festival!
Yeah!
It seems like the whole town's shut down.
Aw, this room's not so bad.
All it needs is some balloons, streamers... And... a pinata!
Good thing I brought some!
Whadaya mean?
Um, so no big deal... well, actually, okay, yes, kind of a big deal... but the brochure also mentioned a karaoke contest?
[blink, blink]
Good thing I bring my own karaoke party!
[bawls]
That is the saddest story-song I've ever heard!
Yay!
This is exactly like planning a party!
Only bigger, 'cause it's a festival!
[giggles]
Which means more cupcakes!
Whoo-hoo!
Ooh.
I've got a date with the Bakery Booth!
Ha-ha!
[giggling rhythmically]
Let's see.
If fifty cupcakes makes a party, that means for the festival, we need... divide by two, carry the one... Super more!
We're gonna need some baking help!
Huh?
Aw, that's so sad.
Excuse me.
I see you're taking your pie for a walk, and I was wondering?
[laughs]
That's not terrorize.
This... is terrorize.
So, how would you like to be a part of the official baking team of the Rainbow Festival?
Uh-huh.
We'll have a booth with cupcakes and pastries and fun, and we're gonna start with this pie!
Let the taste test begin!
[chomps, gags]
Blech!
Bleghhht!
What kind of pie did you say this was s'upposed to be?
Are you sure?
It's kinda... crunchy.
Yeah.
Maybe we should get a look at this tree.
Well, I'm no expert, but I don't think these are very ripe.
Apricots are supposed to be orange.
Sure ya can!
All you gotta do is?
Doing what she does best.
If only there was some apricots we can use...
[clears throat, clears throat more irritably]
[gasps]
What a great idea!
Oh, don't worry.
They will.
We're gonna give it away at the Rainbow Festival!
We did it!
Everything you need for the Rainbow Festival bake sale!
Um, I can't help but notice that the color-matched accessories don't have much color.
Oh, right.
No, who?
[laughs]
Mm-hmm.
What's better than one pie?
Lots of pies!
Official Rainbow Festival goodness right here now!
[giggles]
Only one more thing could make this Rainbow Festival better.
What?
A trout DJ!
[laughs]
Now that's a party!
