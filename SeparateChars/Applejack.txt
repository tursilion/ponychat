Yeehaw!
Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance.
I'm Applejack.
We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!
So, what can I do you for?
We sure as sugar are!
Would you care to sample some?
Soup's on, everypony!
Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?
Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.
Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!
Are you all right, sugarcube?
Whoa there, Nelly...
Ergh...
Simmer down, Sally.
She ain't no spy.
But she sure knows what's going on.
Don't you, Twilight?
No can do, sugarcube.
We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone.
We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple.
And it ain't natural.
Folks say it don't work the same as Equestria.
Rainbow, quit it.
Hold on!
I'm a-comin'!
Let go.
No I ain't.
I promise you'll be safe.
Now listen here.
What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth.
Let go, and you'll be safe.
YEE-HAW!
Git along, little dogie.
Whoa!
All yours, partner.
Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'.
It's just mud.
Aah!
That's what all the fuss is about?
Twilight, wait for us!
Come on, Twilight.
Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
Come on now, y'all.
She needs to concentrate.
Twilight, where are you?
Come on!
Everypony okay?
Gee, Twilight!
I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.
Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out.
I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime.
If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of Granny's girdles.
[chuckles]
Woo-hoo!
Nice?
It's a heap good more than just nice.
I'd love to go.
Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home.
Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres?
Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here.
We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip.
Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.
Rainbow Dash.
You told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples.
What were you busy doing?
Spyin'?
Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.
I asked for that ticket first.
Oh, yeah?
Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle.
Winner gets the ticket.
Drummin' up business for the farm?
Money t' fix Granny's hip.
Wait just another minute.
I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business.
Still trying to take mah ticket.
Did somepony say lunch?
I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty.
Uh, the dessert, not my auntie.
What do you say there, best friend?
Is that a yes?
So, that's a maybe?
Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore.
You can give it to somepony else.
I won't feel bad, I promise.
We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you.
Twilight, you don't have to do that.
Well wallop my withers, Spike.
Isn't that just like a boy?
Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
Whoa Nelly!
[chuckles]
Boy howdy!
I got my work cut out for me.
That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
Come on, big brother!
You need to rest up and get yourself better.
I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle.
Oops, sorry.
I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
This is your sister Applejack, remember?
The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!
I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself.

Well I better get kickin'.
These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.
Hey!
Oh no.
YEEHAW!
Move aside, Winona.
Put 'em up, girl!
Come on, little dogies!
Turn!
Winona, put 'em up!
Ha hah!
Gotcha.

Attagirl.

Yee haw!
Whoaaa.
Hooie.
Now what was that all about?
I completely understand.
Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
Yee haw!
I'm here.
I'm here.

[sigh]
Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just, whoa, Did I get your tail?
Miss Mayor.
Thank you kindly for this here, award thingy.

It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh.
Ooo-ooo.
Ooo-ooo.

Yeah.
I like helping the ponyfolks and  and stuff.

Oh, uh, yeah.
Uh, Thanks.

[sigh]
Phew.
[gasp]
O-oah.
Whoops.


Oh, howdy, Twilight.
It's Applebuck season.
Whoa.
Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time.
We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
[sigh]
They were just here for the Apple family reunion.
They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards.
So, uh, I'm on my own.
Which means, I should really get back to work.
Ahem, hint hint?
Get back to work?
Could you step aside, Twilight?
Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy.
Whoa.
Help?
No way, no how.
Is that a challenge?
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it!
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.

I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow.
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late.
Now, what's this new trick a' yours?
Uh... yeah.
Isn't that a mite dangerous?
Well, all right-y then.
Oh my.

Got it.



You are.
I'm okay.
Really.
I-I have an idea.
Watch this.

Ta da!
Oh, Maybe not.
Okay, one more try.
I'm sure to get it this time.
Heh heh, Here I go!
You're welcome!
Can bees squawk?
I don't think so.
Twenty stalks?
Bean or celery?
You need to walk to the zoo?
Well, who's stoppin' you?
Well why didn't you say so?
What you wanna talk about?
That's quite neighborly of her.
Oh, yeah.
I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
What?
Kelp?
I don't need kelp.
I don't even like seaweed.
Nothin' doin', Twilight.
I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.
WHAT?
Oh no!
I mean, don't you fret.
I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
Chips, got it.
Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie.
What next?
Soda.
Perfect.
That'll get the tater chips nice and wet.
Now what?
A cup o' sour?
Well, lemons are sure sour.
One cup o' sour, comin' up.
Anything else, Pinkie?
Wheat worms?
Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
If you say so.
Yeah!
Muffin spectacles!
Get 'em while they're hot.


What?
Huh?


Wha, huh?
Oh, it's you, Twilight.

I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.
Hardy har.

And no I don't.
Help?
No thanks.

A little more, Little, There.
I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples.
Come on  apples  fall off 
I knew that.
You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
Ugh.
No, no, NO!
How many times do I gotta say it?
I don't need no help from nopony!
Ugh.
Why are we doin' this?
Fine.
Can we just get on with it?
I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters.
Right, Winona?
That's right!
Let's go, bunnies.
In the center.
Hop to it.
Swell.
Just swell.
Put 'em up, Winona!
We know what we're doin'.
Get along, little bunnies.
Must keep buckin', just a few more.
Must finish harvestin'.

No, I don't.
Look, I did it.
I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help.
How d'ya like them apples?
[sighs]
Huh?
Okay, Twilight.
Yes, Twilight.
Yes, please.
I could really use your help.
How about y'all take a little break?
I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!
[sigh]
Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.
I was acting a bit stubborn.
Okay.
A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry.
Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.
[gasp]
Land sakes!
[chuckles]
Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
Spittin' snakes.
Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony.
Let's play.
Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.
That's it!
I can't stand for no more of this!
Can your magical powers do this?
Top that, missy.
Whoa!
A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
It's gorgeous.
Heavens to Betsy!
We knew you had ability, but not that much!
All hat and no cattle.
Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are.
We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.
Mm-hmm.
What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
Yaaa!
Let's go!
Looks pretty cold up there.
Hold on, now.
I think we should all go up together.
Safety in numbers and all.
I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
Don't worry, Twi.
We'll be there lickety-split.
Made.
You could just leap on over.
That's it.
Oh my!
Everypony okay?
Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube.
Wha!
What's that, sugarcube?
All of us are scared of that dragon.
Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do.
So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.
Now what?
What in tarnation?
Twilight!
You gotta come see this!
She's just five away from a new pony record!

Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity.
Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.
[sigh]
Think more practical-like, will ya?
They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.
Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
Uh, there.
Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things.
What now?
Guh.
There is just no pleasin' ya, is there?
Everything's got to be just so.
Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
Does so.
Does so.
Does so.
Does so infinity.
Hah.
I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
I'm not sayin' anythin'.
Y'all just be on yer way, then.
Uh-huh, perhaps we should.
And fast.
Heh.
Nice and dry under here, sorta.
Whoa, nelly.
Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?
Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.

If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do.
[gasp]
What in tarnation?
Now wait just a goll-darn minute.
Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?
Slumber 101: Everything You, Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time.
I gotta skidaddle on home quick.
I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'.
Uh, g'night.

Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.
Blahch.
What in the world is this for?
Puffiness-schmuffiness!
That's good eatin'!
Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?
You betcha.
You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.
Oh yeah?
Well, I'm the get-alongin-est pony you're ever gonna meet.
Just fine, Rarity.
I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness.
Oo-oo!
I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
That's not a real story.
You made it up.
Nah, ya just eat 'em.
Mmm-mmm!

Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me.
Pardon.
Oh yeah?
Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.
And I think the truth is somepony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.
Hah!
[snickers]
[laughs]
[gasp]
Happy?
I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
I will if she will.
My hooves ain't muddy.
There ain't.
See?
Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
Hey!
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Geronimo!
Um, yeah?
Can't hear ya, I'm asleep.

I ain't budgin'.
Give it back!
Yes, you will!
Will!
Will!
Will!
I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
No, it was me.
Ya see?
That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.
Outta my way, missy!
Time's a-wastin'.
No waitin'!
No stoppin'!
Doin'!
And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.
Well, ya shoulda tried harder.
[sigh]
I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.
What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
We gotta do somethin'!

Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing!
I said hussle over here and help me!
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I said I'm sorry!
I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up.
Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess.
But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters!
Please!
Consarnit!
What the, eh, you, I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work.
But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself.
I need your help.

Better?
Is it bigger than a barn?
[sigh]
We're never gonna guess what you're thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.
She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
Is it, a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry.
Ugh.
Are not.
Are not!
Are not.
Whu, which is it?

Whoa!
That mess is your fault, not mine.
We're hidin' from her!
Apple Bloom!
I told you never to say that name.
No good reason?
You call protectin' yer kin no good reason?
Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.
So I swept her up and brought her here.
For safe keepin'.
Not from that creepy Zecora.
Born where?
I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept her!
That's just it, she lives in, the Everfree Forest!
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural.
The plants grow all by themselves!
Apple Bloom!
Hush and let the big ponies talk.
Hey!
Where's Apple Bloom?
[sigh]
That silly lil' filly!
I told her to stay put!
Apple Bloom?
You get back here right now!
Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?
And you!
Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
Just you wait, Twilight.
You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.
Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.
I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!
It's a curse, I tells ya!
Good gravy, girl!
What's wrong with you?
I agree with Dash!
We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
Stop right there!
Turn around right now, missy!
You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant!
I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you!
Aw, pony feathers.
Rainbow!
Thank Celestia!
There's no time to lose!
I need to get to Zecora's pronto!
Giddy-up pony!
YEEE-HAW!
No, Rainbow Dash.
Other way!
I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!
Whoa there.
Easy, Rainbow Crash.

[gasp]
Apple Bloom!
You're okay!
What in the hay does that mean?
Will somepony please talk normal?
Little jokes?
Very funny.
I'm right here, little sis.
I ain't tiny no more!
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many.
Hey!

I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it.
Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there.
I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel.
Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
Yeeeeeee-haw!
Alright y'all, here goes nothin'.
Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away.
Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash!
Hold on girls, we're almost there.
Forget her ladies.
Focus.
Head 'em up and move 'em out.
Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
Looks like our problems are solved.
Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one.
She's a few apples short of a bushel.
[gasp]
My apples!
No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
Brace yourself, y'all, here they come.
[gasp]
Didn't see that one comin'.
So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
Keep pushin', Caramel.
That's it, Bumpkin.
I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great.
Yee-haw!
Oh, just dandy.
A little slow startin', but peachy all the same.
There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear?
We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here.
Well, I, I dunno Twilight.
Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...
Hmm.
She's awful strong for such a little pony.
And what in tarnation does that mean?
What's going on?
Wha'd'ya do?
You used magic, didn't you?
Nuts, Twilight, you used magic.
That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MY FARM!
Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.
I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.
And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?
Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.
Don't get your mane in a tangle.
You'll get your cutie mark.
Everypony gets one eventually.
'Course you can.
Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it.
I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.
[gasp]
Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too.
Huh, same as Big McIntosh.
Get your delicious, nutritious apples here!
Heh... she's so creative, heh.
You forgot your change!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Ma'am!
I am really really sorry about that.
She's new.
Here, take these.
No charge.
And these.
And these.
Y'all come back now, y'hear?
Sorry, little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.
Home.
Now.
Ugh.
Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it.
Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet.
Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?
Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
Well there you go.
Bet you and Twist would have a great time together.
Now run along and find your friend.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
Apple Bloom, you made it.
After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up.
I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing.
These things happen when these things are supposed to happen.
Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy.
I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.
And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.
Hoo-wee!
Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
I know I can.

Oh, for Pete's sake!
All right, all right.
You got another throw there, pony girl.
Wow, Rainbow, heh.
You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw!

Yee-haw!
It's a ringer.
That's how you do it down here on the farm.
Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow.
It's all in good fun.
Besides, you're a mighty good athlete.
I'm just better.
Heh heh heh.
Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily.
Prove what?
You know what, Rainbow?
You're on.
An Iron?
See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is?
To be our judge and keep score.
[gasp]
Dagnabbit.
You're kiddin'!
That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
[sigh]
Nuts and chews!
Still, that's 22 seconds.
Not too shabby.
Hey, don't be nervous.
Remember, it's all in good fun.
Now git on up there.
Woo!
That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!
What was the time on that, Spike?
18 seconds.
Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?
Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it.
Mighty respectable, but let me show ya how it's really done.
Years of applebuckin'.
Wah!
Be a good sport, Applejack.
[gasp]
That's not fair.
You can't use your wings to help you win.
You're cheatin'!
I said, uh-oh.

Only 'cause you cheated.
You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.
Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
Hah!
Prove it.
Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves.
I challenge you to race me in it.
Hold on!
There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed.
[chuckle]
The Iron Phony, you mean.
I'm ready to run a good, clean race.
You are not allowed to use your wings.
Trussed up like a turkey.
Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.
'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
Twilight?
What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
[snickers]
But have you ever run a race?
Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight.
Good luck.
[snickers]
Not so easy without wings, is it?
Whoa!
I don't believe it.
Not the scenery, Twilight.
Rainbow Dash just tripped me.
She did too!
What?
Oh, hayseed!
Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.
See you at the finish line!
It is for you.
Heh.
Ugh.
Hey, Rainbow!
[gasp]
Why, that little cheater did that on purpose.
It's on.
Later!
Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way...
Rainbow.
Mind giving me a lift?
No, I said no wings.
Whoa!
You do?

Cut it out!
You started it.
Oh no, you won't.
Oh no, you don't.
No, I won!
For first?
Last?
What?
How's that even possible?
You're right, Twilight.
Our behavior was just terrible.
W-What are you doin' here?
I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess.
Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split.
Whaddya say, friend?
Wanna go for another run?
Howdy, Rarity!
What do you think she's makin'?
Well, that makes sense.
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Gown?
Shoot.
I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
Hm, Nah.
Okay, sure.
Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.
Just don't make them too, frou-frou-y.
So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five, plus yourself, six ponies?
And lickety split?
They sure are, somethin'.
And we're plumb grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
Are you sure?
I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
What if it rains?
Galoshes!
Why, they're the best duds I ever did see.
Whoa, Nelly!
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
Your business will be boomin'!
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Nah.
Okay, maybe a little.
Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Well, that's mighty big of you.
Oh, right.
That.
Uh, Twilight?
Why are you hanging out in a ditch?
[gasp]
Twitchy tail?
Pinkie Sense?
Whoa!
Nyu-uh!
I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen.
Twilight!
You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice.
Twi?
You okay?
Uh, Twi?
Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar.
How 'bout you, Pinkie?
Whatchu doin'?
[gasp]
That's where Fluttershy's headed!
We better go and make sure she's okay.
I hope nothin'.
I'm tryin' not to think about it.
Just exploded?
For no reason?
Of course not.
I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake.
Look!
There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!
Fluttershy?
Phew, what a relief.
Um... Twilight?
Who cares?
Run!

What are you talking about, Pink?

Golly.
I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
Nervous?
Have you spit yer bit or somethin'?
She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band!
How'd you do that?
[gasp]
And we came to cheer you to victory!
Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.
[laughs]
Hmm, Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet.
The competition's almost over.
Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.
We're almost there, young'uns.
Here we are.
Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse.
Well, don't thank me all at once.
This was my clubhouse when I was your age.
Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm.
And it's all yours.
It just needs a little, uh... TLC.
Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... uh, house cleanin'?
Well, uh, I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders.
You've done one fine job with this place.
So, what's next?
Theme song?
Well okay then!
Sounds like you have a plan.
I gotta, uh... leave no apple unpicked!
See y'all later!
The talent show is just around the corner.
I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
Well, gosh.
Sure wasn't expectin' that.
Uh, Yeah.
Uh, Speechless is right.
Apple Bloom!
You did it!
Not a whole lot to go on there, sport.
Well, this sounds mighty easy.
Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity.
We can't muscle through it!
Whew.
Heavens to Betsy.
Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.
We gotta save her.
Don't mean we can't dig 'em out.
Come on!
[gasp]
Hoho there, lover boy.
Hold on there, little fella.
Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
Hoh, doggies.
If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride.
Come on, ponies!
Kick 'em up, kick 'em out.
Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
Yeehaw!
Get along, little doggies!
Assist you with what?
And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, Hmm.
My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore.
So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after.
The, end.
Heh, uh...
Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree, and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip.
He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
Who you callin' a baby?
Bloomberg's no baby!
Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy.
Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree.
Yes, he is.
A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
[gasp]
They've got Bloomberg!
Braeburn, listen?
Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happened?
Oof!
Braeburn!
Braebu?
Brae?
Braeburn!
You have a very nice town an' all, but we have a hu-uge problem!
Some of our friends are missin'!
And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em!
Let's go!
Oh, yeah?
'Bout what?
That's weird.
'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
They busted their rumps here!
An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
Where?
It's the only flatland around these parts!
The settler ponies need it to live!
You're bein' unreasonable!
I want my kin ta' have what they need to live, but a storm's a-brewin' here.
And I don't like the look of it.
Sheriff, if we could only?
Bloomberg, this is yer special day.
Mama's so proud of you!
Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again?
And which am I supposed to eat first?
Oh, never mind.
I'm not hungry.
Phew!
Now I can eat someth'n!
I'm starved!
Oh... what in tarnation?
Get back here, you thievin' varmints!
Apple Bloom?
I never told you that story?
Why, shoot.
I was just a little filly.
Even littler than y'all.
I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm.
I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange.
So I set out to try my luck in the big city, Manehattan!
The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.
I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.
I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.
It was amazin'!
A rainbow pointin' right back to home.
In that moment, it all became clear.
I knew right then just who I was supposed to be.
That's when this here appeared.
I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.
There they are!
Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!
When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home.
I bet it was your sonic rainboom!
Come here, y'all.
What's he all saddle sore about?
Howdy!
Are you kiddin'?
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
[laughs]
Hoo-wee!
I am beat!
I haven't danced that much since, well, since your last party.
Thanks again for the invite!
Huh?
Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie!
What brings you 'round these parts?
This afternoon?
A-as in, this afternoon this afternoon?
Uh, well, I, I, uh, I don't think I can make it 'cause, uh, I have to, uh, uh, you know what?
I, uh, pick apples!
Yep, apples!
'Cause that's what we do!
With the, apples.
We, uh, pick 'em!
[sigh]
[gasp]
Howdy, pardner!
Uh, I mean, yes, I mean, you can't come in here!
Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some, supplies!
Yup, supplies for the, renovation!
Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom, uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now.
Yup!
Construction!
That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it.
[nervous laugh]
[relieved sigh]
Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?
All right, girls!
Enough of this gab.
Let's party!
Uh-huh, sure!
Hold your horses, girl.
We're here.
Dressed?
Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh, we don't normally wear clothes.
We're gonna be a mite busy.
To sell!
Howdy, partner!
You hungry?
Well, what'cha hankering for?
Caramel apple?
Apple pie?
Apple fritter?
Apple fries?
Well, thank you kindly, sir!
Yee-haw!
In the first minute, I made my first sale.
Just like I expected.
First minute, first sale.
Sixtieth minute, no sales.
[sigh]
This ain't what I expected at all.
Two apple fritters comin' right up.
That'll be four bits.
It's okay, Rarity.
I got you covered.
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food.
They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles.
Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd.
I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
Okay, all you high-class ponies.
Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
Rainbow Dash, what's goin' on with this rain?
I mean chocolate milk?
I mean chocolate milk rain?
Fluttershy!
Do somethin'!
And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
So you know who we are, big deal.
What do you reckon he meant?
Twists and turns and endin' back where we started?
Yee-haw!
What in tarnation?
Where am I?
Who are y'all?
Alright then.
I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord.
What's gonna come of this mission we're on?
Our friendship?
Over?
It can't be true.
It just can't!
That just can't be the truth.
I was talkin' to, uh, nopony!
Nopony whatsoever!
Nothing.
Come on, uh, we best be going.
I didn't notice anythin' strange about Pinkie.
Grrr...
Chocolate milk.
Well, looky there.
Rainbow Dash is flying away.
She's abandonin' us.
Our friendship, over?
Nopony!
Nopony whatsoever.
Uh, Rarity?
This here diamond of yours?
Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together.
Wow, I can see so much better now.
Whoa!
I meant to do that.
I absolutely refuse.
I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike.
I don't have any book.
Beats me.

Mine's workin'.
There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
I better go, too.
I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm.
And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called friends would lift a hoof to help me.
Oh, now you want to fight.
Where you went when I was battlin' Discord?
Wh-what happened?
Twilight!
[sigh]
I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'.
I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies.
Can you ever forgive me?
She could be anywhere by now!
We're never gonna find her.
The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
Rarity, Pinkie, hold on!
Y'all are slowing her down!
That's right.
You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
Yes, ma'am.
I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first.
Hehe.
Now get back to it, R.
I'd take cover if I were you.
You alright, hun?
No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
Come on now.
Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
Y'all hear that?
What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?
Not almost!
Whoa nelly.
Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?
It wasn't her fault!
So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.
Y'all heard the Princess.
Spike, take a letter.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Signed, your loyal subjects.
Howdy, Spike!
Hey, Twilight!
Nice costume.
With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer.
While y'all are here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?
Whoop.
Careful there, partner.
Fit in?
Really?
I mean, that's easy!
All you gotta do is have the right attitude.
Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.
You can do it, princess!
Why don't you try bobbin' for apples?
We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess.
[sigh]
Shoot.
We had everything goin' our way.
Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.
What are you gonna do?
Come on, kids!
Doesn't that sound like fun?
'Uncouth'?
She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.
It means uncivil.
Y'know, bad mannered?
Exactly.
Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time.
She'll come around.
Sisters always do.
Come on, now.
Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on.
Maybe you can help!
Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'.
Watch!
Good catch there, Apple Bloom!
Whoo!
Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.
Apple Bloom!
You're up!
Apple Bloom...
How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!
Apple Bloom!
Way to corral some critters, sis!
What?
H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle.
Don't get ahead of yourself here.
Yeah, um?
Heh, um, actually, I?
[chuckles]
Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself.
Bein' sisters is a give and take.
You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.
But ya never give in.
Bein' sisters is like, apple pie.
You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.
He sure is a cutie.
It's almost time!
[chuckles]
We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
Yee-haw, little sis!
Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks!
We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?
I've never seen anythin' like it.
Have you, Big Mac?
Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!
Night!
Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?
What in tarnation is that?
Apple Bloom, what is all that awful, tapping?
[gasp]
Three cutie marks?
C'mere, you!
Whoa!
Well, I know somepony who might!
Yes, but what's the cure?
What's the cure?
My sister's speakin' in fancy!
I know she needs help!
We can't just wait for this to go away!
We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure!
And fast!
Zecora!
Hurry, hurry!
But magically you're here!
Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
Well, well then give 'em to her!
Quick!
Come again?
Well then let's get to it!
Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!
Somepony!
Anypony!
I sure am proud of you, sis.
Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.
What?
Let's get this thing started!
Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park.
Same time every week.
Eeexactly.
So, if'n you'll excuse us, I got one.
Does she understand what a pet really needs?
Great galloping galoshes!
There's been an avalanche in there!
It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.
A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow.
Wouldja look at that?
He even smiles slow.
And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
Immorta-what?
Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
And she's modest and humble.
She lets her actions speak for themselves.
Gotta admire that.
I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.
But a real hero doesn't brag.
Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
I think we're getting off topic here.
Listen to her.
She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk.
How come y'all aren't doing any gardening?
This is a garden party, isn't it?
You bet they are, birthday boy.
C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times.
I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.
Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples?
For that matter, who would steal my leaves?
[laughs]
Oh, that's a good one, Twilight.
Sweet little Spike, running wild.
Ha, what a laugh.
Twilight, get my rope.
Get us out of here right now!
[gasps]
What was that?
Hooo-wee!
Canterlot, here we come!
There's so much to look at!
I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria.
It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?
Uh... ugh.
That'd be a first.
Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around?
Shoot, I really thought we could get through to 'em if we?
Actually, we're all out.
Where should I start?
It feels like we're going in circles.
Absolutely not, your chancellorness.
It's just that there are holes in the map, and?
Yeah, uh?
Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship.
Heh.
It's just that, the map is also upside down.
You're right!
It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map... secretary.
Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead.
And fertile, too.
Perfect for growing food.
How about Earth?
I agree.
Let's all calm down.
I know, I know.
Then, this is our fault.
We three tribes, we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other.
Now it's destroyin' this land, too.
Well, I don't hate you guys either.
No matter what our differences, we're all ponies.
I didn't know unicorns could do that.
Don't blame me.
Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it.
After all, she's got wings.

There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom.
I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school.
You know what'll happen.
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret.
Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.
The zap apple harvest has begun!
So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn?
Babysit?
Now?
When there's a swarm o' hungry caterpillars headin' this way?
I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
Aw shucks, Apple Bloom.
I sure hope so.
Oh, shucks.
I'm not much for speeches.
Buuut!
This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for.
Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony.
So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall.
I promise to make Ponyville proud.
You betcha, Granny Smith.
You betcha, Mayor.
I'll do better than my best!
Guess that means me.
Darn tootin'!
See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!
Huh, some ponies.
Sheesh.
Uh, hey, everypony.
What's up?
Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee.
You don't have to go into all that.
S'no big deal, guys.
I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here.
That's it.
End of story.
Sorry, but that's all there is to tell.
Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now.
Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay.
Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me!
There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!
Sure am, Miss Jubilee.
What are you all doing here?
Fine.
What are you five up to?
Uh-huh.
Well, just remember: no talking about Ponyville.
Canterlot was fine.
Yes.
Some.
Yes, I saw 'em both.
Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo.
Real good treats.
Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts.
We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all.
Yes.
No, 'cuz it was none of her business!
No, no, NO!
I'm not telling you why, so just?
You promise not to ask me any questions?
That kind of question is fine, Pinkie.
No, I-I never had a cherrychanga.
Make it stop, make it stop!
Never!
Alright, alright!
I'll tell everypony what's goin' on!
Just please stop talkin'!
But, can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast?
I'm plum tuckered out.
[sighs]
I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast.
Pinkie promise.

Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!
Whoa!
What the hay?
Hey!
Cut that out!
Whoa!
I'll pay you double to outrun them.
I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
Hyah!
C'mon, y'all!
Go, go!
Pinkie, I did not break my promise!
If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast.
But I didn't come for breakfast.
I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.
I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth.
I just can't!
Yes.
Hyah!
Yee-haw!
Ha, try and catch me now.
Oh, nuts.
Fine.
Now you know.
Well, just look!
Don't you get it?
There's every color of ribbon down there.
Every color, but, blue.
I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.
That's why I came here.
I wanted to earn some money.
After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved.
I couldn't come home a failure.
So, you're not upset or disappointed?
But what about the mayor?
I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Attention, everypony!
Cider season is now officially open!
Heh.
Sorry, everypony!
That's it for today!
Hold on, everypony.
We've done our best to improve supply this year-
And it's always true.
But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria.
Sorry, but that recipe takes time.
If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
What in Equestria is that?
Uh, sure, I guess.
I just don't know, y'all.
We've always made cider the same way.
Hold on.
Who gets the seventy five?
Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter.
We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
You wouldn't dare.
I'm not so sure.
They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
You can't sell that cider!
That's made from Apple family apples!
Our cider speaks for itself!
We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm.
Me 'n' the family are, one hundred percent confident, in our cider making capabilities.
Thanks, Twilight.
We'll need it.
Ready!
Great job, y'all!
We've already filled an entire barrel!

C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus!
We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!
Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh!
Ride!
Ride!
I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
Keep it up, everypony!
We're back in this!
There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
Thanks.

We, lost?
No, Rainbow Dash.
A deal's a deal.
Congratulations to y'all.
The cider business in Ponyville is yours.
C'mon, Apples.
Let's go pack up our things.
Go ahead, everypony.
Go on, y'all.
It's okay.
They're gone.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Is she gonna be okay?
I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
Is she serious?
Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here.
You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day.
Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.
What's all the ruckus?
There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus?
What kind of disaster?
The perimeter's clear.
Me neither.
You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.
What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash?
Still think they're lame?
But why would you want to, Spike?
You said it, ooh...
She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!
Applejack Asleep on the Job!
Can y'all believe this?
And this one: Big MacIntosh, What's He Hiding?
Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?
Eeyup.
Nnope.
Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along?
This here cake's a mite heavy.
Right, Big McIntosh?
Phooey on the festivities!
I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.
Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.
What is it?
Uh, you're investigatin'?
Well, color me pleased as punch!
Your brother's getting married?
Congratulations, Twilight!
That's great news!
As one of your PFFs, Pony Friends Forever, I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
Why the long face, sugarcube?
Come on, now.
You're his sister.
He'll always make time for you.
And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
Cake, check.
Ice sculpture, check.
Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted...
Hiya, Princess!
Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.
You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
Aw, shucks.
Why don't you take a few to go?
I know how you brides can be.
So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
Spike!
That goes on the cake.
Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
She didn't say.
But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them.
And you had your doubts about her.
Ya sure about that?
C'mon, y'all.
Let's go check on the princess.
I-I don't understand.
How can there be two of 'em?
Okay, this is just gettin' weird.
Real me!
Real me!
Sorry, Twi.
We should've listened to you.
I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considerin'.
Twilight!
Uh, did you pass?
Focus, Rarity.
We're here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery.
Why we're all here.
Sorry, Twilight.
These crystal ponies seem to have some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'.
Only thing I was able to get out of 'em was somethin' about a library.
Uh, thought I just did.
We're lookin' for a history book.
Somethin' that might tell us how the Empire might've protected itself from danger back in the day.
Uh, anyone else startin' to think this is a lost cause?
What's this thing for?
Nice work, Twi.
Think we're ready to get this faire up and runnin'.
Come on in, y'all.
Got food and drinks thataway, games and crafts are thataway, Crystal Heart to the back near the Princess.
Uh, Rainbow Dash?
We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong.
What I mean is, maybe you should let me keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while you show off your joustin' skills.
How are y'all feelin'?
Havin' a good time?
Well, that's good!
Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right?
Oh, I hear ya, but, uh, phew!
Gettin' a little toasty out here.
Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar!
Uh, you tried the Crystal Empire fritters yet?
Made from a traditional Crystal Empire recipe!
You're gonna love 'em!
Uh, I hear there's a joustin' match about to start!
You don't wanna miss that!
Come on, Twilight...
These Crystal Ponies are more curious than a cat!
We gotta do everything we can to keep this thing goin'.
The Princess isn't lookin' so good.
I can't imagine her magic is gonna last much longer.
It's gonna be fine.
These ponies are gonna power up that Crystal Heart when the time comes, and we won't be needin' her magic anyway.
On its way!
Oops.
Now, don't y'all worry your pretty, little Crystal heads!
The real Crystal Heart will be here any second!
Don't know if I believe me...
But, good things are better when they're a rarity.
There you are, Pinkie.
Been lookin' everywhere for ya, girl.
Heh.
Well, I'll be an apple crisp.
I'm here for the same reason.
And my family's havin' a barn-raisin' this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres.
Me too.
I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!
Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant!
How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie?
Hyah, ya Pinkies!
Hyah!
Oh, give it a rest.
You up for some wheelbarrow races?
Oh, Pinkie.
Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom.
It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade!
We're just goin' to the train station!
[sigh]
Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'.
Just pick somethin'!
You know what would make a good impression?
Bein' on time to pick her up!
You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube.
Y'all are gonna get along great.
You already have somethin' in common.
Neither of you have your cutie mark.
Well, I?
You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here!
Yep.
Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember?
Ah, that's her!
[laughs]
Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?
Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special.
Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan.
Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank.
Yup.
She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home.
I'm so proud of y'all.
You've done a good deed.
Huh?
What?
Are y'all okay?
[sighs]
Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning.
Good.
And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear?
Bad seed?
I thought y'all were friends now?
Yea...
That's enough, Trixie!
Forget it, Trixie!
I ain't doing nothin' 'til you let Twilight come home!
Okay, I'll do it!
Just make it stop!
Hoo!
I hear you, Pinkie.
I can't find anything that describes the kind of magic Trixie's doin'.
She wants me to grow apples with no peels!
Now how the hay am I supposed to do that?
We need to get this information to Twilight.
She'll know what to do.
What do you say, Fluttershy?
Can you handle the mission?
Alright!
Huh?
You packed bug spray?
Yup.
Looks like we're all set then.
Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?
Well, looks like we're all set now.
'Course she is, sugarcube.
She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite.
Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!
The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no.
This time, it's actually yes.
There's Rainbow Dash up there right now.
Well, some of us didn't pack as light as the others.
So we were slowed down a bit.

Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.
Don't you worry, little sis.
There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent.
I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a pack of mules.
If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!
You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day.
What gives, Scootaloo?
You sure you're okay?
You seem a little jumpy.
No need for tents tonight, y'all.
We'll just take shelter in that cave.
Bbbbrrr!
Hoo-wee!
It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail.
Bbbrr!
Where's that Scootaloo?
It's all we need.
Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?
If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?
So where's its brain?
'Fraid so, Scootaloo.
Good night, y'all.
Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight.
Is there some reason why?
She is the best flyer in Ponyville.
Good luck!
Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet.
Give her a chance to settle in first.
Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to?
I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells!
So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox.
Suit yourself.
Why not?
Is anypony else followin' this?
Count me in!
It's a twister!
We wanted to bring you a care package.
Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill.
You did what?
Found 'em!
Heh.
Gesundhoof.
Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then.
I could always help out.
You may be a tad old, Granny, but you're as feisty and full of spark as ever?
Uh, I just meant...
Why don't you let me take over puttin' the reunion together this time 'round?
Then all you need to worry about is enjoyin' yourself.
I won't let you down, Granny.
You just tell me what the reunion needs, and I'll take care of the rest.
Okay, so I'll need to get new quiltin' materials, fabric, needles, thread...
You've really been workin' on the same quilt since the first reunion?
Better get twice as much honey and flour, then, fifty more buckets of apples, more oil, wood for the fire...
Races.
We'll need cloth ties, finish line...
Not much to a seven-legged race.
Hmm, Photo in front of the barn.
Got it.
That's true!
Busy as everypony's lives are gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next time 'round.
Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most memorable reunion we've ever had!
I'd better get started, I've got some plannin' to do!
Apple Bloom!
What are you doin' up?
I can't sleep.
My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion!
Fun?
That's just the beginnin' of it!
Granny Smith handed me the reins of this reunion, and I'm gonna make the most of it.
Apple Bloom, I've got so many things planned you won't even have a minute's rest!
Trust me, little sis.
This reunion I'm puttin' together is gonna be worth the wait.
Rise and shine!
We don't have much time!
H-ah.
Think that'll do it!
They're here!
Howdy, y'all, and welcome to the Apple family reunion!
My name's Applejack, and I just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya!
We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns.
And there's lots more to come after that!
Hope y'all enjoy it!
Babs!
Huh, so glad you could come!
Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course?
Don't you worry.
There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins.
Alrighty, ponies!
Ready to have some fun?
Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race.
Much more.
Trust me, I have put together somethin' you are never gonna forget.
After the seven-legged race, you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin' for apples!
Then you'll run around these trees fifty times until you're real good and dizzy.
Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles.
And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance plates on your head while sayin' Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets over and over and over again.
Last pony standin' wins!
Seriously!
C'mon, y'all!
Let's start makin' some memories!
On your mark, get set, Whooeee!
Lookin' good, everypony!
Ooh, better go check on the quilt.
Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy.
Y'all should get started, though!
I got rid of 'em to make room for these.
This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt!
Won't that be excitin'?
I said, won't that be excitin'?
That's the spirit!
Havin' fun?
Better pick up the pace on those fritters though, huh?
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.
Now you try!
That's it!
Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals!
We want every Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria!
Alright, Apples, break!
Ooh, can't forget to capture all these memories for Granny's album!
Huh.
Nothin' all that memorable there.
Or there.
Or there.
C'mon, Applejack, think.
You gotta kick this thing up a notch!
Hm...
And your minute's up!
Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them.
There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride.
Alright, everypony!
Step right up, take a seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions!
Now, I know y'all've been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories.
And in all of our past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the farm.
Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'.
So let's get this show on the road!
Giddy-up!
Uh-oh.
Ruined.
Everythin' is ruined.
Oh, Granny.
I'm so, so sorry.
But it's not alright.
Just look at this!
The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed!
How can that possibly be a good thing?
Really?
[sighs]
Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna remember about this reunion is that it was the worst one we ever had.
The family photo!
Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year, unless, everypony!
I have one more activity!
Trust me, Granny Smith.
This'll be one we'll remember for all the right reasons.
Come on, Apple family!
Let's get to it!
Wee-hoo!
Whoo-whee!
Come on, Apples!
Get 'er done!
Yee-haw!
Attagirl!
Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Come 'n' get me, ya big goons!
Run!
Whew!
Aw, don't mention it, Spike.
C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now.
Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate.
Guess you did too, huh?
Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike.
That was mighty kind of you.
But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later.
That's sweet, but you don't have?
Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other.
You don't need to repay the favor.
Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary.
Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do...
Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath.
I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead.
Good job, you two.
Heh, you definitely don't wanna be late for that.
Spike, you can head on out too.
I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven.
I dunno, Spike.
Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me.
Really, you don't?
It's just not necessary?
[sigh]
Oh, all right.
You can help Granny Smith and me bake some?
[sighs]
Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but I can take it from here.
What's that now?
Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your dragon code, truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me.
Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I?
Oh, uh, okay, I would like you to, hmm, huh, Help me take some of the pie you made to Rarity.
Uh, sure, why not?
Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off?
[sighs]
I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever.
Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true.
But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'.
You tasted that pie.
Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful.
Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop.
I dunno.
I don't want him to get hurt.
You are?
Why didn't I think of that?
That's plenty high!
Come on down, Spike!
I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help.
My help.
She doesn't need it.
Right, Rainbow Dash?
And so am I!
I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else.
Exactly that!
There's nothin' else.
I don't want you to do anything.
Well, I?
Huuuuh, that does feel good...
Breathin'?
I certainly do not?
No, I'll think of 'em.
Lemme think of 'em.
Twilight?
Twilight, are you there?
Twilight!
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I know Spike told you that he was gonna follow his dragon code, and serve me forever for savin' him from the timberwolves, and that you were okay with it, but?
He said he told you all about it.
I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you.
I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily.
Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him!
I sure am startin' to.
All right, y'all, here's the deal.
Spike needs to save my life.
I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf!
When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf.
I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck.
I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf!
Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even.
Everybody get it?
Yes?
What d'you mean?
Uh, Oh, well, aheh, how's this?
Hooooooo.
No time!
Here he comes!
Uh, over here, Spike!
Oh, yes, I, I was just hopin' you could maybe, uh, sweep up all those leaves for a compost pile, and?
I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em...
Oh no!
I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks!
I cannot run away!
I am a damsel in distress!
Help me, Spike!
No, no, don't wait a minute.
Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf!
Whooooah!
I can't!
I'm really stuck!
Come on...
Forget it, Spike!
You gotta get out of here!
Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?
My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me!
But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life!
It was somethin' alright!
'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place.
[sighs]
I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say that's what friends do and leave it at that?
I promise I won't think of you as any less noble.
You got yourself a deal.
What's he goin' on about now?
Well, it's about time.
My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle!
Apologize?
He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!
Fine, fine.
I apologize.
[sighs]
Thanks, Fluttershy.
Don't know what I would've done without you.
I can't watch...
That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!
Hold up!
I-I think he's tryin' to tell us somethin'!
I've never seen the floodin' this bad!
They've built dams 'round here before, but never like this!
What's goin' on?
Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike.
You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya?
She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise.
That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike.
He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us.
Come on, girls, or we're gonna miss the train.
One more for the road?
Oh, you little puppy-wuppy, come on here!
[chuckles]
Whooeee!
My dogs are barkin'.
Did y'all hear that?
They really are!
Think he's still got a handle on things?
You all hear that?
I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona.
Oh, I miss her.
Oh, this is gonna be a real treat.
Princess Cadance said she'd never seen the Crystal Ponies so excited.
[sighs]
But we've run this, like, twelve times already.
I think we've got it.
On a train car?
[sighs]
Probably should've watched our step while we were still on it, too.
They must have everypony in the Empire out sprucing it up!
Princess Cadance was right.
These ponies do look pretty darn excited.
Whew!
The Princess wouldn't have had it any other way.
Where the heck is she anyway?
Wasn't she supposed to be here by now?
Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe!
We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that.
[sighs]
And not a moment too soon.
Where's Cadance?
Please tell me she's right behind you.
Oh, please still be here...
Oh please, oh please, oh please...
Think he's still got a handle on things?
You all hear that?
Yee-haw!
Now that's more like it!
What's next?
I'm on it.
I know just the thing.
Twilight?
Is that you?
Wha, I-I've never seen anything like it!
Way to go, Princess!
Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight.
Fluttershy's right.
Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready.
The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home.
Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube.
You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun.
The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected.
Exhibit A: The six of us are united by the Elements of Harmony.
No amount of royal duties is gonna change that.
Right, everypony?
Right, Pinkie Pie?
Come on, y'all!
Put your backs into it!

Dagnabbit, we ain't never seen this kind of trouble with weeds before.
Now that I think about it, I've never seen these kinds of weeds at all!
Have y'all?
Where the heck are these things comin' from?
And what in tarnation is goin' on with the sky?
Neither are all these crazy plants!
They're comin' from the Everfree Forest!
And try as we might, us Earth ponies can't do anythin' to get rid of 'em!
Don't suppose you know any magic that might stop 'em from spreadin'?
The forest is expandin', y'all, and judgin' by how fast it's movin', it doesn't seem content just takin' over Ponyville...
I reckon before long, it'll cover half of Equestria!
Guess it turned out you were missin' something here in Ponyville after all.
I told ya we'd always be connected by the Elements.
[sighs]
Now we just gotta figure out who to aim these bad boys at so we can get Celestia and Luna back and keep the rest of Equestria from becoming plant food!
Any ideas?
Don't you play dumb with us, Discord!
We know you're the one behind all of this!
Works for me!
Any idea why all this is happenin'?
It's just, you were mumblin' to yourself...
Well, all right then!
Let's go save a, tree.
Uh, where is it exactly?
[sighs]
A little too close, if you ask me.
You sure you're all right?
You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things.
And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us?
You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her.
For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly.
Sure, but, well, the rest of us aren't princesses.
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone.
If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess.
Maybe it's right down there.
So let's save it already!
And I suppose you've got a better idea?
That's what I thought.
We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash!
We were tryin' to protect her.
Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons!
You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!
I sure am glad you came looking for us.
Twilight, The Elements of Harmony, They're what keep us connected no matter what.
[sigh]
Gone.
One thing I don't get.
Why did all this happen now?
Uh-uh.
There is no way I'm movin'.
Well, what do we do now?
Tied?
Right.
I think I might have an idea of what we can do.
Well, here we are!
When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend.
When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her.
Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of the Pony of Shadows!
Nopony knows!
You might wanna rethink your position on that.
You saw that, right?
Well, that's why I brought you here!
I guess only the most daring pony of all could stay in this castle all night without being scared off.
Well, m-me neither!
Deal.
Me too!
Humph!
I can't say that I am!
But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash.
Me neither!
Huh?
Yeah.
Nothin', creepy about that.
Uh, I'm over here.
You hear that?
Uh, maybe?
Do you think there's a single room in this castle that isn't filled with terrifying things?
Yeah!
It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything.
Right?
Huh?
Whoa-oa!
Rainbow?
Hello?
I guess if I don't find you, I win by default, right?
Yaaaaah!
Shadows everywhere!
Twilight?
Well, that depends.
I thought you went to ring the school bell all week!
I think we all did.
I know what my first entry will be!
Dear Diary, I'm glad Granny Smith's legend wasn't true.
I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last Daring Do book for the twelfth time.
Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place.
We didn't do this, Ms Yearling?
whoa!
Amazing!
We can't go back now!
Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!
This don't sound like you.
Drop the ring, Ahui, whatever your name is!
Nah, that's okay.
Spike!
Where are ya, Spike?
Somepony wanna tell me what the hay is goin' on?
Did she just call us, Power Ponies?
Whoa!
But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!
Lemme get this straight: We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world?
Lead the way, Spike!
Is that a, shampoo factory?
Time to Power Pony up!
Hold it right there, partner!
Whoo-ee!
You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso?
Any minute now...
Yee-haw!
It's officially Apple Bucking Day!
Look at all those apples!
Ripe and juicy, perfect for buckin'!

What the heck is goin' on?
[gasps]
They're back!
Attention!
This is a Sweet Apple Acres code red!
I need all hooves, and claws, on deck!
Calm down?
How can I calm down at a time like this?
Vampire fruit bats are attackin' Sweet Apple Acres!
The fruit bats do, but these aren't just your everyday ordinary fruit bats.
They're vampire fruit bats!
I'll be darned if they think they're gonna sink their fangs into my blue ribbon apple.
This here's our entry into the Appleloosa State Fair's produce competition.
You know how much TLC goes into getting an apple to grow like this?
Them vampire bats want to shrivel it up like a raisin!
Yeah, right.
Be my guest.
Well?
What'd he say?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard!
These vampire bats are nothin' but a bunch of monsters!
No, I do not.
So let's get to roundin' them up so they don't destroy the rest of my orchard.
Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?
Listen, Fluttershy.
That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards!
You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares!
Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year.
They had to ration out apples all winter!
Not, drop.
If Granny Smith wasn't with Apple Bloom an' Big Mac checkin' out our produce competition in Appleloosa, she'd be here tellin' us to do just that!
This circumstance is plenty dire to me!
So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy?
Will you do your Stare on the bats or not?
Hold it right there!
We've gotta round up these beasts with wings first.
Time's a-wastin'!
Good work, everypony!
I think we got 'em all!
Now all we need is for you do to your Stare.
Good, now you go, Twilight!
Only one way to find out for sure.
My crop is saved!
Yee-haw!
I wanna thank you for your help.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Now all we gotta do is sweep up these cores so I can start buckin' fresh tomorrow mornin'!
Apple Bucking Day, take two!
Yee-haw!
Time to collect those juicy, sweet apples!

You're darn tootin' the spell didn't work!
I think we're gonna have to take more extreme measures!
Wait a minute, I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry.
Does everypony have their pony signals?
Now remember, Pinkie Pie, only use the signal if you see somethin' suspicious.
Alright, now everypony split up.
We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard.
Whoever or whatever's destroyin' my apples has gotta be here somewhere.
Pinkie Pie, bats don't eat ponies.
Not even vampire bats.
And how'd you figure that?
Look out!
Whoa!
That's the least of my worries.
I just want my friend back.
There she goes!
But even if we can lure her to us, how're we gonna get her to stay still long enough for you to do your reverse spell?
[sighs]
Thank goodness you're okay!
Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I didn't take your suggestion in the first place.
Yup!
More cider too.
Be sure to put in there that I came to see that my short-term solution was a little short-sighted.
Now, how about we celebrate our stronger than ever friendship with a nice, ripe, juicy apple?
Hey, look!
That's the theatre where Hinny of the Hills is playin'!
So then you can do something nice for us!
It must be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed.
Normally she doesn't even like musicals.
First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done.
Come on, Rarity, buck up!
All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business!
Yeah, you were pretty rotten.
Wow!
That was even better than I imagined!
We know.
We're happy for you, Rarity.
We're just sad for us.
This is just so excitin', I can hardly believe it!
I'd try to tone it down a little around non-family members, because I don't want to make them jealous, but it really is.
You are gonna love bein' an Apple.
I mean, you've got the playful one, the strong one, and of course, there's Granny Smith, who knows everythin' about everythin'!
And then there's me.
Do you smell that sweet apple air, Pinkie Pie?
That was rhetorical.
Of course you smell it.
You're an Apple now!
Aw, Apple Bloom, that is sweet, but--
Huh, I just can't believe we've never heard anythin' about this before!
Hmm, I'm not seein' where exactly it says we're family.
It, I see the part about our great, great auntie Applesauce and fourth cousin twice removed part, but that last bit's awful smudged.
Are you sure it says 'Pie'?
It is, it is.
I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure.
Are y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Hey, everypony?
Since Pinkie Pie's back home gettin' her stuff for the trip, can y'all gather round?
I just wanted to say somethin' real quick.
Er, no, Granny, your teeth are fine.
I just wanted to be sure that we're all on the same page about showin' Pinkie Pie how awesome a family we really are.
We want her to get to know the family she's been born into, but, like, the best version of it, y'know?
Er, Big Mac?
Are you sure we really need all that stuff?
Are you sure you're strong enough to really pull all that stuff?
Are you sure the wagon's strong enough to hold it all?
Then lets get this show on the road!
C'mon, Apples, y'all know this one!
Yee-haw!
Big Mac!
I thought you said?
Uh, I thought?
I mean, not that I'm blamin' you, because we don't blame in this family, but I thought you said all this stuff wasn't gonna be too heavy.
Heh.
Just one problem.
We haven't got a raft.

'Bout the only thing that didn't get packed.
That is, uh, fascinatin'... don't know that it's helpful, but it is fascinatin'...
Hm, worth a shot!
Could be worse, I guess.
Now remember, this time we're only packin' the necessities.
Pinkie Pie, when did you have time to make this?
Woo-hoo!
We did it!
Uh-oh...
All right, y'all.
Please tell me that the map didn' get wet.
'Cuz it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now.
[gasp]
All you had to do was bring it to me.
No singin', no dancin', no games.
Just walk it over!
Are you sure you know which way to go?
Uh, I don't know.
Um, Granny?
Are we supposed to go through a cave?
And you're sure it's not that cave?
The one we're headin' straight for?
Heh, you sure did.
Uh-huh.
Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny?
Think I'll take it from here on out.
You taught me to trust my common sense.
And my common sense says we should get to Goldie Delicious's cabin in one piece.
That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day.
It would be easier if the map hadn't gone overboard!
Exactly!
So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'.
[laughs nervously]
Uh, Pinkie Pie?
Maybe you could read that one out loud?
I can't believe she witnessed our family fallin' apart like this.
[sighs]
I can't believe I was arguin' with you so much that I tore the wheel right off the raft.
It's like I wasn't myself at all.
Everypony, I think we have to let Pinkie Pie know that even if she does discover that she's an Apple, she does not have to feel obliged to consider herself one.
How can you say that?
We started out as one big unit, and now look at us.
You must be Goldie Delicious.
So nice to meet you.
Well, we think we're all Apples.
But we need your help finding out if Pinkie Pie here is our fourth cousin twice removed.
Whoa!
Well, I know for sure!
I can know for sure that it doesn't matter what the book says or doesn't say.
After all you've been through with us and all you've put up with, it's obvious you're an Apple to the core!
Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie!
We'll see you soon!
Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal.
Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together.
About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes.
Not so fast!
If you're gonna be good, you're gonna be better with some of my apple brown bettys in ya.
They're perfect.
And we will make it to the Games once everypony carbo-loads on my apple brown bettys.
Sorry!
Got the idea from them, but, It looks like they got better aim.
This'll cure everythin' that ails ya!
Don't forget your bettys!
Uh, what were you gonna do with them before?
And I packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry.
What could you be nervous about, Twilight?
Cadance just loves you to pieces!
I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way.
Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together.
Go on, have a hootenanny with your kinfolk.
What is that thing?
What in tarnation are you doin' here?
And why the jumpin' June bugs are you blue?
What are you, sick or somethin'?
How do you know about her trip?
That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible.
Maybe.
They're plenty close.
I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved...
Oh, boy!
This is gonna be good!
Yeah.
You sure did come on the right day.
Well, they don't call him the super duper party planner for nothin'.
Huh.
Best I've ever seen.
What's a goof off?
Of course she is.
Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there.
Whoo-ee!
All right, Rarity!
Probably more than a touch!
I'll say.
And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'.
Uh, who's Trenderhoof?
Uh, gee, thanks.
Granny Smith always said, Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away.
Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria?
'Cause?
Is that a fact?
Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville.
Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores.
And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about.
Rarity, what are you wearin'?
Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it?
Really?

Maybe you two should try it sometime.
Well, it would help if the harness was on right!
What are you doin'?
Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it.
But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind.

Now, Rarity, you be careful.
If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof.
Well, your way is definitely long on style.
Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do.
Inside!
Whew!
Well, that was close.
What are you talkin' about?
Listen, I know you really want Trend to like you?
I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me.
And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'.
Not even me!
Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend?
I'm too scared to guess.
Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen!
Because you would never dress like that.
You like fashion and high society and fancy things.
But you don't!
Because I know you.
And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too?
Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you!
Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking?
And I can like fashion just as much.
Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think.
Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me!
Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista!
Oh, is that so?
[gasp]
Not me!
My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times.
My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them.
I'm so fashion-forward.
I smell like rosebuds.
There's the Rarity I know!
I kinda know how you feel.
Thanks!
It's nice, ain't it?
Oh, it's, uh, one of yours.
Well, that's real nice, but I sure hope you weren't thinkin' of Sweet Apple Acres.
Uh, look, you're a fine pony, but, uh, well, I'm, uh...
What do you think, Rarity?
Is it too late to go back to Small Town Chic?
It was like a little slice of heaven.
Howdy, everypony, and welcome to the twelfth annual Ponyville turkey call!
Who will take the title this year?
Will it be somepony new?
Or will the turkey call champion of six years defend his title to make it lucky number seven?
Alright, everypony!
Let's talk turkey!
Big Mac, you're up!
Probably hidin'.
You know how much that pony hates the spotlight.
And you sounded better than ever, big brother!
Big Mac, you got some 'splainin' to do!
Turkey call?
Trash your voice?
Zecora remedy?
Not quick enough?
Needed a deep voice?
Poison joke?
Flutterguy?
Better now?
And that shy filly was livin' her dream in the shadows because she couldn't bring herself to come into the spotlight?
Well, for corn's sake!
Let's go!
Incredible!
The praise for your fantastic singin'?
See?
That wasn't so bad.
How come?
Heh, sorry, Fluttershy.
I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly.
They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.
Hey there!
Can we come in?
Oop, sorry about that, little one.
Uh, what did he say?
Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'.
No one knows rare magical creatures like you do.
You okay, Fluttershy?
Now, hey there, filly.
I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility.
We know, Granny.
That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone.
Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube.
It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this.
Just a little list of helpful reminders.
[sighs]
I guess you are.
I'm just not so sure I am.
[sighs]
Right.
Okay then.
Good luck, little sis?
whoa!
Eheheh... sorry, Big Mac.
I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom.
You think she's gonna be okay on her own?
I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list.
Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first.
[sighs]
I know, I'm probably just bein' silly.
But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time.
You go on ahead and make your delivery.
I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine.
Apple Bloom!
I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did!
I never thought about how dangerous things are around here!
You are now!
Because I'm here and I'm stayin'!
No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!
Pies?
Family's way more important than pies!
I know.
I should never have left you alone.
What was that?
Oh, no!
This is worse than I thought!
Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again.
I'm stickin' right by your side, always!
Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom!
You need somethin'?
I'm right here!
[laughs]
[chuckles]
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?
Heh, yup!
Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again.
Aw, that's sweet.
I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry.
I'll always be here for you.
Always!
Hey, Apple Bloom!
You need anything?
A snack?
A hoof massage?
Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage?
O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'!
Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube?
Huh.
I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed.
Then again, you are a delicate flower.
[sighs]
Sleep tight, Apple Bloom.
I'll check on you again in a bit.
Just checkin' in on you again!
Need anythin' now?
How 'bout now?
Need another blanket?
Did I hear a cough?
Want a glass of water?
Just, checkin' in on you again.
[sighs]
Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like.
Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine.
Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time.
Huh?
Scootaloo?
Sweetie Belle?
But, where's Apple Bloom?
She's not here!
She could be anywhere!
She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom!
What?
Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?
[gasp]
I may never see my little sister again!
Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two.
Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots?
A lion tamer's chair?
A snake charmin' flute?
A hunk of ricotta?
[gasps]
Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there.
When did she leave?
Oh, no!
Hang on, Apple Bloom!
I'm a-comin'!
Howdy!
Let's go!
Are you okay?
I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you!
I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse.
I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you're?
Huh, the cart!
And all the pies!
You actually got them all the way up here?
In the dark?
Through the Flame Geyser Swamp?
Past that monster?
By yourself?
Huh, wow.
That's mighty impressive!
Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her.
Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister.
But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do!
I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out!
And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again... I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own.
I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out.
Little sister, we're always good.
Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday?
Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy.
I think we've had plenty.
And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station?
Aw, what a great tradition.
Never met a pony or critter who didn't love Granny Smith's apple spiced muffins!
We're just gonna have the best time!
Uh, so this here's Winona.
That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel.
Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too.
Maud?
Would you like to try one of Granny Smith's famous apple spiced muffins?
Oh, uh, heh, that's not?
Um... it's like looking for a pebble in a haystack.
Well, you don't have to make it even harder.
Uh, alright, fine...
She sure is, different from what I expected.
Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'.
You 'bout done peelin' them apples for the cider, Maud?
Oh, uh, yep.
That's a very interestin' method you got there.
[laughs nervously]
I mean, nah.
I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already.
Sure, why not?
What do you think, Maud?
We're practically twins, heh.
[sighs]
The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do.
We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't.
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Watch out!
We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof.
Right behind ya!
Alright, but this is the last one.
Absolutely not.
Wow.
I wonder where everypony's headed.
Now where in Ponyville do you two think you're goin'?
The Flim Flam Brothers!
This should be interestin'.
I don't.
There's somethin' funny about this whole thing.
Are you as worried as I am?
When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is.
Well, I don't know about that, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again.
Hang on now!
We'll get ya!

I'm not so sure that tonic really does anythin'.
I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic?
I think maybe it's time we found out.
I guess.
Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe.
Hey!
Now hold it right there, Mister...
Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works.
Because he's part of the act!
It's time for you to tell the truth!
You never needed crutches at all, did ya?
Hey!
Huh?
You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again.
If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse!
What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured!
Until today, that's right.
I guess... I... Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I don't suppose it really matters.
Granny, wait!
Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy?
I don't know, Granny.
A swim meet sounds pretty safe.
And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all.
It seems to work for Granny.
Just remember, you two.
The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right?
Uh, good luck, then!
[sighs]
Right.
Well, I'll be... what are you doin' here?
If you say so.
This has gotta stop!
If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen?
[gasps]
Granny!
What in blazes does she think she's doin'?
Land sakes!
[gasps]
That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life!
You can't do a dive like that!
I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
I didn't mean to!
But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real.
I know it was wrong.
I just hope, with time, I can win back everypony's trust.
I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along.
But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!
Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things.
But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble.
I don't know... I'm sorry, Granny.
I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'.
Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about.
But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more.
Maybe some ponies don't care about that, but I sure ain't one of them.
Now you take it easy there, Granny!
And I'm sportin' some sort of getup worn by Colonel Purple Dart.
Now, don't you fret, Rainbow.
This fashion show nonsense wouldn't help me learn nothin', either.
Who, me?
Oh, I got nothing.
Why, I could tell you every little thing there is to know about the history of apples, but I picked all that up over years in the field as a labor of love.
How much time you got?
Oh, then you are up a creek.
And Granny Smith discovered the first granny smith in Fillydelphia, when she was just a filly!
What is it, Twilight?
Could be wrong, but I think they might've noticed.
If'n you got the goods to trade for it.
I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'.
Well, I'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls.
I know what you mean, Rarity.
Hey!
Why don't we pool our trade stashes?
That way, if one of us finds somethin' real valuable she can't live without...
I feel the same way.
Me too!
You're not gonna believe it!
There!
Right there!
A dented vintage pie tin.
The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster!
They don't make 'em like this anymore!
It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'.
But that doesn't make a lick of sense!
Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference!
So which is the vintage one?
Hah, you're bluffin'!
Well, because, I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got!
There's no way anypony would notice the difference!
It's five seconds faster!
I'm an amazin' friend!
So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all, you take our stash.
No, you are!
No, I insist.
You go fetch what you want, 'cause that's the kind of tried and true friend I am.
Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this!
And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'.
So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend.
What in rhubarb pie just happened?
Made me sit up proud like a cornstalk in August!
He sure seemed to be having a tough time of it out there.
You gotta tell him, just in case.
That's Dash and Fluttershy!
We got silver!
Too bad Ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'.
We don't have anyone to root for.
Pretty much.
Forgive me for bein' blunt, Spike, but you're not makin' a lick of sense.
How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt?
How exactly is that different than smilin' and wavin' like not a princess?
That's just silly.
You've got a real important role in Equestria.
As in Discord Discord?
It has been a while since we visited the castle.
Might be fun!
I just hope another 'friend' of ours never makes us sorry we had to give them up.
How'd you guess?
Don't you have a creepy magic-stealin' villain to track down?
And good riddance!
Sometimes I think the 'reformed' Discord is more obnoxious than the 'before-he-was-reformed' Discord.
How could I forget?
It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.
I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
And in that moment, I knew I had to be honest.
I just knew it.
But what's that got to do with openin' the chest?
Jumpin' junebugs, Twilight!
When did you learn to fly that fast?
Alright, y'all.
I think we've warned everypony to stay inside.
Surely you saw this comin'.
You think that might be the last one we need?
I dunno, sugarcube.
Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that.
Aw, shoot, I reckon you're right.
Careful, Pinkie!
It's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk.
I reckon we just ought to head into town and talk to some locals, find out what's goin' on.
That there's the Princess of Friendship!
Howdy, Double Diamond.
I'm Applejack, and this here's Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle.
Say what?
I think we ran off to the end of Equestria before we even knew what that map was!
That and two bits'll get you a cup of cider.
I guess you're right.
And the sooner we figure out why, the sooner we can go home.
Uh-huh... I got an idea.
But you gotta eat all of them muffins, Pinkie.
You got a stronger stomach than any of us, and that filly in there might be our best chance at findin' out what the hay is goin' on round here.
I can't believe you ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie!
We'd best go inside and get some more!

This door's shut tighter than a, summer of, uh, piglets in, shoot!
I can't even make countryisms no more!
Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it.
But they're never gonna believe we switched over in just one night.
Y'all don't understand, do ya?
You can't force nopony to be friends!
It don't work like that!
So what are we gonna do while Fluttershy's out there lookin' for our cutie marks?
Then let's get moving, y'all!
Yee-haw!
Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again!
I'll never get used to that.
Looks like you were right, Twilight.
The map did have a reason for sendin' us here.
We brought real friendship to these here ponies.
Guess that's why you're the Princess of Friendship.

Mm, these are delicious, Pinkie Pie!
Now that you mention it, she was lendin' a hoof at Sweet Apple Acres the other day and stuck around 'til near midnight.
Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes when all I needed was ten.
Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who.
Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what.
Uh, Twilight?
Is there somethin' you wanna tell us?
We'll make this place feel cozier than hot cider on a rainy day.
Come on, y'all!
We've got work to do!
Wow, girls!
We did a great job together...
Nope, just old!
Unlike your sparkly window doohickeys which are... why, they're just swell!
[laughs nervously]
This place looks like a mishmash of knickknacks.
Okay, we all agree the castle is too cluttered, right?
So why doesn't everypony take one of their own decorations out and we'll see how it looks?
Come on, Rarity.
Everypony has taken somethin' out except you.
Okay, everypony calm down.
I'm sure we can find a way to remove the clutter together.
Hey, those are my warmin' quilts!
Oh, no, I'll help you.
She said it herself, if anypony should be able to make her feel comfortable in her new home, it's us.
If we can't do it...
Calm down, Pinkie.
We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right.
Come on, y'all.
We just need to think about Twilight.
What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library?
Yeah, for you, maybe.
We had a lot of good memories there, though.
That's what made the Golden Oak Library home.
[gasps]
That's it!
[sighs]
Maybe my plan won't work after all.
What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like.
It's the memories you make when you're there.
And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from.
Truth be told... I couldn't either.
Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight.
[sighs]
One of Pinkie Pie's confetti cannons.
Oh, Pinkie... I'm sure there are, but you don't need to?
All right, that's enough, sugarcube.
Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night.
And nopony's gonna make ya move out.
Of course, I'm sure.
Now get some sleep.
You'll see.
Everything will be better in the mornin'.
Breakfast!
See, now what did I tell you?
A good night's sleep'll fix just about an?
Well, no wonder you were so worked up!
Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
I have no idea what it means.
Apple Bloom!
What in tarnation are you doin'?
Only a pest pony can do that!
Now come on!
We gotta skedaddle!
Are you crazy?
Breakfast!
See, now what did I tell you?
A good night's sleep'll fix just about?
[gasps]
Well, no wonder you were so worked up!
Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
More like what?
I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark.
But before you go, make sure you do all your chores...
Breakfast!
See, now what did I tell you?
A good night's sleep'll fix?
Well, no wonder you were so worked up...
Right...
Nothin' at all...
Right, Big Mac?
Eeyup.
And we don't have room for non-apples.
Eeyup!
Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better.
See, now what did I tell you?
A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'.
What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there?
Buck up, Sugarcube.
You just ain't yourself these days.
Uh, it's okay.
Tank'll come back in a few months.
Alright, alright.
There, there.
Nice going, Fluttershy.
How do we get her to stop?
Nope, I'm good.
It's true.
You think she's done or just getting a third wind?
The fun's come early!
Yee-haw!
I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash.
See you later, little feller.
Whew!
It's been a dog's age since I got to compete.
All the rodeos 'round Ponyville are closed down for some reason.
Just doin' my best to fill your horseshoes, Braeburn.
Ooh, sorry.
Say, where's my sister and her friends?
You said you'd keep an eye on those fillies!
How am I supposed to focus on practicin' if you're not gonna?
Y'all can't go runnin' off like that, y'hear?
Backstage at a rodeo ain't no kind of playground!
[gasps]
What the hay just happened?
What is it, Sheriff?
Now, quit yer bellyachin'.
I can't have y'all around here with some outlaw on the loose.
Aw, maybe I oughta call it quits and go home too.
Whew!
Good job, y'all.
I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow, but I wish they would've warned us about this rainstorm.
Braeburn?
Where are the girls?
What?
Sheriff Silverstar!
You gotta help!
My sister's gone!
And her friends too!
It must've been Trouble Shoes!
You really wanna take that chance?
Braeburn?
Get these fillies someplace safe.
Sakes alive, what's with you?
Why in tarnation would you want me to help get him out of jail when he's the one who ran off with y'all to begin with?
Now if y'all excuse me, I'm off to win the Appleloosa rodeo hay bale monster stack.
There y'all are!
How 'bout your big sis, huh?
Since when are y'all so into rodeo clowns?
That's the best rodeo clown I ever seen!
[laughs]
What the hay?
Sweetie Belle, what are you talkin' about?
Maybe it'll teach you not to go wanderin' off after I say not to!
Y'all helped Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means.
Ain't that a nice feelin' you can take back with you?
Nnope.
Alright, y'all, keep it down.
It ain't like it's a life-changin' experience or nothiiiiing...
My little sister's all grown up!
That's what you're worried about?
Really?
You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks.
You know everything about these fellers.
It's gonna be dandy.
Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' howdy.
Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie.
We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit.
[sighs]
That wasn't so hard.
Pinkie Pie, what do we do?
Y'know, it's goin' okay.
You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria.
I searched the farm inside and out.
No Pinkie Pie.
But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so not a complete loss.
When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'.
Heh-heh.
We panicked and tried to plan our own party.
Look at these!
Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!
Looky here.
It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary.
But they ain't nearly that old!
Huh.
She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too.
And their five-hundredth?
Mm-hmm.
All right, Winona.
Time for your brushin'.
Oops.
I guess I'm too plumb tuckered out to do this right.
Even us?

One good thing about not sleepin' well last night, shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep now.
[sighs]
Now this is what I call an incredible dream.
Yeah.
I reckon I could live without seeing that thing ever again.
Big Mac!
Boy, I'm glad to see somethin' familiar!
Oh, no!
Big Mac!
You can do anythin' in a dream, remember?
How are we even gonna know when it's able to escape?
But this here isn't Ponyville!
It's a dream!
Say what now?
She sure did!
Only, I'm not exactly sure what she did.
Gosh, Rarity.
I know hard work when I see it, and it looks like you worked your hooves to the nub!
That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity.
Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it herself?
Uh, Whew!
Got here as fast I?
Where do you think?
Seems a hair odd, though, don't it?
Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan?
But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be?
That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as all of Ponyville.
We'll have to miss it.
No tellin' how long we'll be in Manehattan.
I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset.

Ponies move so fast here.
Not at all like back home.
Eyes peeled, ears open.
Eyes peeled, ears open.
Sorry 'bout that.
Sorry.
Hey?
Oh, dear.
Butter my biscuits.
I can barely cross the street in this town.
How am I supposed to help solve a?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it.
Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done?
Uh, friendship problem, anypony?
[sighs]
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.
To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for.
Oh, right!
She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours.
Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into... that is, if we can ever get off this street corner.
This Midsummer Theater Revival, what is it, exactly?
Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company.
Kinda reminds me of Ponyville.
What happened?
Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity?
You bet your boots we will!
It's just an expression.
So you'll help us?
I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival.
Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things.
It's kinda, well, my thing.
Could be the reason the map called me here!
Uh-huh.
Well, there's a lot to do, but Rarity's right.
The map wouldn't have called us here if we weren't up for the challenge.
You two go on and take care of the costumes.
I'll see you at the dress rehearsal.
I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can.
No, wait!
I haven't gotten a chance to, reinforce the stage yet.
I've been thinkin' the same thing.
I mean, I can at least see why you're here, Coco's your friend, and you have an eye for costumes and all, but me?
I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big.
Now hold on there.
I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home.
I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can.
I think I've got a plan.
It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'.
And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right?
That's the spirit!
Sorta...
Alright, y'all, it's ready!
Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer is all.
To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start.
When those fell through, we decided to simplify.
This here was the result.
Oh, yeah?
Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up.
I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for the better.
Yee-hoo!
We did it!
Huh?
You do?
Well, I'll be!
Heh-heh.
But all the same, I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train.
I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out.
[sighs]
Woo-hoo!
You trickster!
Hey there, Big Mac!
Did you want somethin'?
Aw, gee-whiz.
[laughs]
Well I think it's sweet that you hold that opinion, but?
Uh, Apple Bloom?
I think Big Mac's got somethin' he wants to show you.
Hold on, sugarcube.
I need a minute to talk with Big Mac.
Hey, Big Mac, you all right?
You sure?
You seemed a little down back there.
Come on, you can tell me.
You feelin' a little left out?
Apple Bloom and I have been spendin' a lot of time together gettin' ready for the Social.
[gasps]
What in the... now calm down.
Let me just go over to Twilight's castle and see what's what!
Maybe it's just a false alarm.
I said maybe it's a false alarm.
Well, it's not.
Rarity and I have to go to Manehattan.
No can do, sugarcube.
When duty calls, I gotta answer right away.
What kind of an example would I be settin' for my little sister if I didn't?
[sighs]
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom.
Try and cheer her up, won't you?
Oh, sugarcube, if Mom and Dad were here, they'd be so proud of ya.
Now go on and party with your pals.
Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it.
Oh, didn't anypony tell you?
Shining Armor and Cadance are held up.
They may not arrive 'til Saturday.
Well, go on then, sugarcube.
Well, the pleasure's all ours, Princess.
So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise?
So what's the first clue?
I'm not quite followin'.
Uh, didn't you make that, Rarity?
I don't like where this is goin'.
Shucks, Twilight!
Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here.
Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go.
That's us.
See you later!
But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve.
Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow.
That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it.
Is it?
It's so excitin'!
Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!
Friends or family, this here's about togetherness.
Now hang on, sugarcube.
You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right?
'Fraid so!
A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends.
But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'.
So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away.
Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born.
Uh, what happened to the flag?
Mm-hmm!
And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors.
Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.
And tomorrow, we open presents!
Rooftastic?
What if our families don't like each other?
How'd you know that?
This place looks amazin'!
And you must be?
Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her.
So far, so good, cousin!
Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least.
What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?
Yeah, um, you know what?
This is what we were expectin'!
Right, everypony?
[laughs nervously]
O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle.
Tune me up and let's get back to dinner.
Now that's somethin' I know all about!
Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?
Uh, y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family?
The what findin' what now?
So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?
You mean on the flagpole?
Traditionally, it's the youngest?
Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?

I still don't understand.
It's all just so, complicated, and, rock-based.
I don't know.
I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time.
A picture?
I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie!
Y'all hide your presents?
So nopony gets presents?
So lemme get all this straight.
You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?
Well, how 'bout you picture this?
Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...
Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!
We've gotta do somethin', y'all!
Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!
Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant.
[sighs]
I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be.
It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style!
We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit!
Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie!
Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget!
And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!
I didn't mean to cause a fuss... why don't we just open presents around the flag pole?
It'll be fun, you'll see!
Oh, boy.
I really cracked the corn this time.
Pinkie Pie?
What are you doin' here?
I'm too ashamed to go back up there.
Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop.
I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours.
I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one.
I really hoped we could be one big happy family.
I guess not.
I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch.
You too.
Aw, crickets!
That is important!
I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em!
To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie.
Cousins forever.
Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train.
Stop the train!
Need a little help?
I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours.
I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away.
What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours.
And over time, we'd make new traditions together.
I'm sorry, y'all.
Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie.
And we'd have missed out on how great you sound.
Don't forget the best part.
Goin' through my family's corn maze!
Uh, only if you're up for it.
Hoo-wee, we're gonna have the best time!
Great costume.
She definitely tried her hardest.
Everypony's linin' up for the corn maze, y'all!
Let's go!
Hey, try to keep up the illusion, would ya?
Agh!
What was that?
Uh, o-of course I do.
It was, uh... uh, I don't know!
I don't know what's goin' on!
Whew.
There's Granny Smith.
Not that I was ever scared, 'cause I wasn't.
I'm a pretty good actress when I wanna be.
Granny?
Alright, I got to admit I didn't know about any of this, but maybe they're just tryin' to make it interestin' for me, too!
I'm sure Granny Smith or Big Mac is behind this.
That's what we were supposed to do!
I don't know why we're down here!
This is really scarin' me now!
Fluttershy?
You out-nightmared the scariest part of the corn maze!
Uh-huh!
Aw, shucks, Twilight.
We haven't even asked how your weekend went.
Heh.
Oh, don't you worry about Twilight.
Bet you were in hog heaven organizin' all them books.
Again.
Well, I like the sound of that!
Uh, I reckon you mean my sister Apple Bloom.
I recall it bein' a large stick that looked like a hose that, in turn, did in fact resemble a snake.
A stick!
I don't suppose that means we're gonna need to get a new tablecloth, does it?

I wonder why she asked us here so bright and early.
A what now?
What kind of fertilizer have you had your nose in, Twilight?
So much for that whole spell theory.
Sure you can, Twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it.
Wait a minute.
You didn't suggest not inviting Twilight because you wanted to make her feel left out, did you?
Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo.
Sapphire Shores?
Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?
Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?
Don't know.
Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly.
[laughs]
Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if that Coloratura and this Coloratura were the same Coloratura?
Heh.
Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess.
Sure do.
It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.
Well, fancy that!
That there's the very same cutie mark!
Nah.
This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!
Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Coloratura to Rara!
We had the best time at Camp Friendship!
Rara was just so easygoin'!
We were like two apples from the same branch.
Rara and I prepared this song for the camp talent show.
When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!
After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but then we lost touch.
But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big.
But a demandin' diva?
Just you wait, Pinkie.
Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me.
Really?
Rara?
No, that can't be her.
Um, Remember me?
We met at Camp Friendship?
I gave you the nickname Rara?
Yeah!
Heh.
Howdy, Rara!
Yeah, real special.
Pinkie's right, Rarity!
The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated.
She's become a whole other pony!
Rarity was right!
I don't believe it!
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara.
He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.
If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.
The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!
Now that's more like the Rara I remember.
I heard, Pinkie.
But don't you fret.
I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up.
Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies.
Uh, Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?
Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.
Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?
I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.
Jealous of what?
A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her?
No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!
It just ain't right!
He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!
Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!
Countess Coloratura!
I said your new name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday.
And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events.
Come on now.
You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.
Do exactly what I say.
We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.
Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry.
Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?
Can you give us a minute, Rarity?
Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?
Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara.
Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star.
But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self.
And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.
What can I do for you?
Of course I am.
This is my home.
But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash?
Or you for that matter?
Nope.
Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago.
Not that I know of.
Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else.
The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire?
Where have you two been?
Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'?
Well, I'll admit.
I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before.
But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.
Different how?
That's easy enough.
[sighs]
When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it.
And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.
And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight.
But we aren't friends.
At least not here.
Look.
I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples.
[sighs]
I hope you do.
It's taken quite a while to find you, Zecora.
[laughs]
Uh, what's she doin' here?
I can't believe y'all were able to travel through time like that.
But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we?
Frankly, I'm not exactly clear on all the customs and traditions of the Crystal Empire, especially when it comes to a Crystalling.
We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby.
Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un.
Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees.
We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family.
Well, a mobile is real nice as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it.
Yeah.
How can you just be born with 'em?
And we'll all help you with everythin' else.
I'm guessin' that's gonna make it harder to do the Crystalling.
But what about when King Sombra ruled the Crystal Empire and the Crystal Heart was missin'?
The city wasn't covered in snow then!
Yes, ma'am.
C'mon, girls!
Honestly, I don't know if there's gonna be a Crystallin'.
The truth is, the baby's an Alicorn and her magic's plum crazy, so you might not wanna be that close after all.
You can't stay here!

That's what we've been tryin' to tell you!
Just a little bit further, y'all!
The station's just ahead!
Yeah, peaceful now, anyway.
I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight.
Meet Big Mac!
He's not much of a talker.
Ain't that a mouthful of molasses.
Yeah.
Good luck, Dash.
Well we can't wait to hear all about it!
So you started off on the wrong hoof.
I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day.
Speakin' of... hey, Dash!
Heh.
Except maybe cotton candy.
You sure you wanna go through with this?
The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who.
And you and me have got to have us a little chat.
You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'?
You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours.
They'll be along in a bit.
For now, it's just you and me.
Let's get a move on.
We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it.
We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday.
We're goin' to learn about you.
I'm pretty sure Rarity's gonna read a review of her new boutique in Manehattan.
It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster!
If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, where's Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium?
Yeah.
It wasn't even catchy.
Leave Plaid Stripes to me.
I'll handle her and her, uh, good ideas.
Uh, fabric?
Oh, no?
What would Rarity want?
You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes.
If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium.
But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no.
Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea.
Useful, too.
Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes.
I told Plaid Stripes no.
Stripes, I owe your daughter an apology.
She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a chance.
So here's what I'm thinkin'.
Heh.
Toldja spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea.
And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect.
Hey, there, Rarity.
I really tried to get here earlier.
I just can't believe how much time my chores are takin' up these days.
At least now we'll finally get to spend some quality spa time together.
Right?
Aw, shucks, Rarity.
I guess I missed the whole day.
I sure am sorry.
Sure thing, Spike!
Gah!
Land's sakes!
Is it time for our spa day already?
Rarity, why don't you go on ahead and I'll meet ya there?
Well, it ain't 'cause I don't wanna.
But the work on the farm has just been takin' up more and more of my time.
[sighs]
Wish I could.
But Granny, Big Mac, and Apple Bloom all have chores of their own.
And today, they're all busy takin' the harvest to market.
Maybe... well... I suppose if you two got started on feedin' the pigs, I could maybe leave for an hour.
[sighs]
Okay.
This list pretty much covers everything you need to know to feed the pigs.
But, uh, maybe I should go over it with you just to... uh, right.
I'm glad we're doin' this, Rarity.
I've been puttin' work before our spa time for too long.
I know we've only got an hour, but I can't wait to have a steam.
I just hope Twilight and Spike can handle things until I get back.
I know.
You're right.
I really am glad we're doin' this.
And as long as it's only an hour, I'm sure everythin' will be just fine.
Yeah.
I didn't think spa treatments were your thing exactly.
Huh.
[chuckles]
Too bad Rainbow Dash just hates those froufrou spa treatments.
She could have joined us for a nice steam.
Hoo-wee!
I can't wait.
So everypony here wants a steam bath?

Nothin' doin'.
I came here to have a steam, and that's just what I'm gonna get!
Not without my steam!
Um, why are y'all just standin' here?
So if you're not gettin' enough steam, that must mean there's not enough hot water.
Hmm.
Now what do we have here?
Well, sure, but have you always run every single one of these here machines full bore all day, every day?
Hmmm.
Looks to me like you don't have any left.
I think I figured out the problem.
You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up.
And while ponies wait, they get cold.
Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness.
Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels.
That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse.
Rarity, are you kiddin'?
I can't just leave things like this.
I'm gonna need my tools.
Whew!
Now that that leak's fixed, ponies won't get so cold they use up all those towels!
And without all that laundry, there'll be plenty of hot water for all the steam anypony could want!
[laughs]
No, thanks.
I'm just relieved I can finally relax in the steam.
What do you say, Rarity?
Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity.
We'll just have to do this another day.
Twilight and Spike should be done feedin' the pigs by now.
Look, I know Twilight's a princess and an Alicorn, but she isn't a farmer.
I've been doin' farm work my whole life, and I'm not sure it's somethin' you can just figure out.
Well, I suppose I could try... assumin' everythin' went well so far.
I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself.
That's alright, Twilight.
I know you did your best.
I guess a list can't really capture all the ways I have of doin' things.
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had!
Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'.
An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'!
Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation.
Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry.
You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better.
I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous.
Right?
It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!
I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how!
Why are y'all starin' at me like that?
What?
Of course!
Why would I be doin' it if it weren't?
See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out!
So I open and close it to let them know it's safe.
Of course not!
I fixed that ages ago.
Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen.
Well, no.
They got used to it.
Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance!
To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would.
'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate.
Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake.
Well, I'll be... Huh.
I wonder if I've been doin' that around here with anythin' else.
[sighs]
Thanks, y'all.
I guess I just got so used to doin' everythin' a certain way, I didn't realize there were any problems.
I think I have a few ideas.
[sighs]
Think you can come up with enough things for us to do now that we have more time to relax?
Heh.
Well, let's just start with the rest of the day for now.
After all the work we just did on the farm, I am ready for some serious relaxation!
Gettin' a sports pamperin'?
[giggles]
That is, if you don't mind sufferin' through one or two froufrou treatments.
And from the look on your face, I'm guessin' it's for another one of his extended stays?
Well, if your parents won't stand up for themselves, maybe you need to stand up for them.
Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart.
I mean, the Applewood Derby did?
Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional.

Fastest?
Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days.
The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern and?
Not Apple at all.
The Apples win most traditional.
We have since the Derby started!
Why would anypony want to win anythin' else?
Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like!
Oh, apples, quit complainin'!
In my day, we were up even earlier!
And my cart wins most traditional!
Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day!
Yup.
You can feast your eyes on, this!
I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet.
But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see?
Uh, is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom?
Bless my hooves, I thought we covered this!
Tradition is all that counts!
And who knows tradition better than Apples?
Nopony, that's who!
So are you an Apple, or are you an Apple?
No, not the fringe!
Ugh!
Why, shoot!
Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time!
No time!
And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect?
Whoa, ponies!
Wait for me!
This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace, slow!
And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom!
They'll be along.
Faster?
Don't be silly.
This is perfect!
And my old-time cart is a rootin' tootin' wreck!
But I thought you all wanted our help.
Oof.
I guess we owe all three of you an apology.
Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again.
And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy.
Yeah.
A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut.
Uh, yeah, sorry about that.
But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful.
Not if I have anythin' to say about it.
See ya in the mornin', sugarcube.
Huh?
Whoa!

Ugh!
Rainbow Dash!
Well, she needs to stop.
Look here, Rainbow Dash.
I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night.
I think you three should be real proud.
Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round.
Uh, any minute now what?
You sure you don't mind us all comin' over?
What in tarnation are you goin' on about?
This way!
Ugh!
That's ridiculous!
Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years!
It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies.
What did you do?
Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed...
[chuckles]
Yeah.
How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?
Yep!
And you can thank Pinkie Pie.
After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you.
Or think it's funny?
I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots... uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie?
You're our resident Yakyakistan expert.
Heh.
Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here.
Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
Bye, y'all!
Whoa!
Oof!
Ugh!
Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'.
Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball.


So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?
Hmm?

Hmph.
An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.
The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!
We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.
I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is.
And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it.
So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration.
The two Earth ponies are on offense.
They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff.
They both try to be the first one to kick it.

And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team.
You two get the idea?
Okay, just try your best, Pinkie.
I have been doin' this a lot longer than you.
Nice kick.
Great save, Fluttershy!
Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that?
Um... okay.
Well, let's see what the rest of you can do.
Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row.

Nope.
Um, okay.
Let's see what the rest of you can do.
Definitely not.
Not a chance.
Nope.
It sure didn't.
Amazing!
Catch!
Huh.
And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be.
I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game.
And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple.
Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team.
All right.
But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious.
With serious practice!
That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would.
All right.
Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.
Keep it up!
Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever!
Come on, now!
Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres!
And me!
And Dash!
And all of Ponyville!
Come on now!
Keep it up!
What in the apple happened to those two?
All right!
That's it for today, y'all!
Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow.
All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.
Yup!
We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!
I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa!
That should feel pretty good!
Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.
Get serious and play hard and?
[sighs]
Guess not.
We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them.
We know you're in here!
We've looked in every other car on the train!
Nope.
We're gonna take your place.
So you don't have to worry about that at all.
Against us.
Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you.
Yup.
You two just do your best.
Ahem.
You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.
And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.
I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable.
Winning's never worth that.
And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not.
Huh.
Looks like you three made quite an impression!
The map is sendin' us where?
But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot!
It's just one big party!
Probably not as bad as we think.
It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time... right?
You're right.
It's worse!
If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I.
All we have to do is solve our friendship problem and get back home.
'Course, we have to find it first.
Gladmane?
I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus.
Lead the way, Mr Gladmane!
Howdy!
Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here.
Fluttershy?
I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of needles.
But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine.
They sure do.
Flim and Flam.
Absolutely not!
Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them!
Trust me.
I know those ponies, and you're better off with them apart.
The two of them together will cheat the hooves right out from under you!
And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it!
Shouldn't somepony do somethin'?
Heh-heh.
Now that sounds like a real friendship problem!
I thought you two got along.
Two friendship problems in the same theater?
Now we're talkin'!
Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem.
Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed to be good for Gladmane too.
Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that they can't.
I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out.
I just can't figure it!
The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's the best friend any of these ponies have!
So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce!
He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose!
There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth!
[sighs]
Fine.
Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here.
Maybe.
Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over?
Sounds to me like neither of you said those things.
Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did?
And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because?
The what now?
I sure hope you two know what you're doin'.
Can't argue with that.
They're comin'!
Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession!
Flim and Flam told us you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did, you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it!
This was all part of the plan!
Gladmane has left the buildin'!
And if it weren't for you wantin' to show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able to trick the trickster.
Must've felt pretty nice to finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use.
Flim and Flam!
Are you sure this is what Twilight would want?
Seems like you might want to take your time with each of these.
I, guess.
While y'all figure that out, I'm gonna start layin' out the pictures for scrapbookin'.
We got a whole lot of time to cover.
We've got at least eighty moons worth of memories to go through.
However you want me to organize them, Starlight.
Sweet Apple Acres, twenty moons ago.
Granny Smith was lookin' for her favorite pie tin.
She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there.
She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there.
Huh.
Turns out Granny Smith didn't know how to make a pig do the backstroke.
Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer.
Granny Smith knew she was gonna need a bigger boat, so Goldie Delicious says, If you can't say anythin' nice about anypony, come sit by me!
Big Mac knew if he just covered himself in mud, the creature wouldn't be able to see him!
She was just a pony standin' in front of another pony askin' him to love her.
They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom!
It was the best of apples, it was the worst of apples...
Big Mac told me, With a whole lot of power comes a heck of a lot of responsibility.
I don't know what kind of whammy Starlight put on us, but I feel like I got shoved through the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.
Well, ain't that the understatement of the day.
Hey, Starlight!
Most of the Apple family photos are still layin' around in the wreckage.
I think I'll come along and hunt 'em down.
The sea air carries a portent for trouble this day.
'Tis a treacherous and perilous journey that lies ahead of us!
We sail to adventure, or our very doom.
Arrr!
Get those off me ship!
Yar-har-har-har, hardy-har-har-har!
I'll be chartin' a course to the very heart of that maelstrom!
This be the only way to Plunder Cove!
Yah!
There'll be no mutiny aboard me ship!
Is that all you've got?
[laughs]
Ahoy, mateys!
Batten down the hatches, y'all, 'cause this here's gonna be a boat ride of adventure!
Ooh, are those chocolate chip?
I'll give it a go!
Whoooooa!
Heh-heh!
Whoa, doggie!
Hold on a tick.
Pinkie Pie says it's Rarity's fault, and Rarity says I sank the boat?
Well, that's plumb crazy!
If you two really wanna know what happened, I'll tell you.
Y'all know how Pinkie Pie and Rarity wanted to get out of their element?
Well, I bought a treasure map to give 'em a rip-roarin' seafarin' adventure!
But they had other ideas.
Alright, mateys, but just y'all wait 'til you see the high seas adventure I've got planned!
Unfortunately, they seemed less interested in a treasure huntin' adventure and more interested in snacks.

U-uh, Rarity, I?
Oh, it gets a sight worse than that!
Huh?
Whoooooa!
Looks like we need to change course!
Maybe so, but it's also the only way to find Plunder Cove!
And Pinkie Pie was just about as helpful as a weasel in a hen house.
Hold on, everypony!
Yup!
And maybe if they ever apologized, I'll consider talkin' to them again.
Winona brought me your note about a friendship emergency!
H-How can I help?
Oh, there's no emergency!
I'm just waitin' for an apology.
[gasps]
Even so, I don't appreciate bein' hornswoggled into comin' back here.
I think we all know which pony's about to be proven right.
What in the hay does that have to do with anythin'?
So, we attracted a tri-horned whatchamacallit?
How about you and Pinkie Pie?
Wait a minute.
You brought all those games and things for us?
And I just wanted to give you two a high seas adventure, since that'd be somethin' new and different for y'all.
Well, not half as much trouble as you did makin' all that fancy food, and bringin' all those games!
Agreed!
All right, you big softie!
Bring it in!
Well, that's the last of it, Filthy Rich.
Our pleasure.
See ya next time.
Uh, Apple Bloom, did you pack up the cider into the same crates as the zap apple jam?
But the crates aren't marked.
You kept track of what went into which crate, right?
Good.
Because we wouldn't want Filthy Rich to get a shipment of cider when he's supposed to get zap apple jam.
You know how Granny feels about sellin' cider anywhere but on the farm.
Are you sure he got the right crates?
If you gave Rich the zap apple jam, then what's this here?
Don't worry.
We know exactly whose fault it was.
Now why in tarnation would you lie to me, Apple Bloom?
Tellin' lies won't fix anythin'.
Trust me.
I know.

You might as well tell her the whole story.
Might even do her some good.
It's not a story I'm proud of, but it taught me a lifelong lesson about bein' honest.
I hope you learned somethin', too.
Rainbow Dash!
Just be honest with them.
I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from.
Pinkie Pie always acts strange.
You freaked out and ran away from a festival?
That's the funniest danged thing I've heard all day.
Just one more.
Eh, not-not exactly.
Hmm.
Wonder why she didn't tell any of us about it.
Come on, girls.
This could be fun.
Hoo-wee!
You solved that triangley thing mighty fast!
Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?
Don't both those fruits mean purple?
Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?
Yeah.
Fauna's always fixin' Winona up when she ain't feelin' too fine, so helpin' her out is A-okay by me.
I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya.
Huh.
But come to think of it, I actually know a filly who'd be more help than I would.
She's a friend of mine from Winona's sheep-herdin' competitions, Wrangler!
Heh.
She's an expert in animal enclosures.
Uh, what is it, sugarcube?
She does have a point there.
You wouldn't want a bunny wanderin' into the wrong cave, would ya?
Well, she's the boss.
[sighs]
And Wrangler sure made a fool outta me, too.
I'm sorry, Fluttershy.
You show 'em, filly!
What?
What?
I know.
But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am.
You want me to judge a fashion show?
Uh, I think I might be a little too practical.
My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat.
Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job.
Fashion just ain't my bag of oats.
Sure, I guess I can do that for ya.
Yeah, I know, Big Mac.
I-I was just as surprised as you are.
I mean, heh, can you imagine?
Me, judgin' a fashion show?
Well, you're the exception in our family, sugarcube.
You know about that kind o' stuff.
I'd be as useful as a burned knot on a zapplin' tree.
Although... Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality.
She already has experts for the uh, fashion-y stuff.
Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say.
Come on, Apple Bloom!
You're doublin' our workload here!
That's because it's not like mine.
You don't need a fancy scarf to keep your hat on.
Now you can see.
Sure thing.
You know what?
I am gonna help Rarity judge her show!
I think my sensible everypony take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!
Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge.
It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well.
Wow.
Uh, that is just, wow.
These are clothes?
She looks like a disco ball!
Hah!
D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?
I can't believe anypony would actually wear this!
Am I right?
Oh, gosh.
I didn't mean to make her faint.
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.
Uh, Huh?
Well, it's a lot of black.
It's kinda, depressing.
Maybe to fashion experts like you.
But to ponies like me, it's still black.
And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future.
I don't think they liked what I had to say.
Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?
On purpose?
More like an old and tattered look!
When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!
Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric.
With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time.
Thank goodness I'm here.
Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses.

So, uh, when are you gonna do her mane?
Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!
Heh!
Great!
At first, I didn't think I'd be much help.
But thank goodness I signed on!
Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!
To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all!
And that's if you could reach most of 'em!
Heh.
There you go!
Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set.
Like a poncho!
Who cares if it's stitched perfectly?
You don't need feathers on your head!
My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her, an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!
What?
Oh, no.
Uh, it's just, I mean, Those belts look the same.
You're kiddin', right?
They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.
There is no choice!
They're the exact same belt!
Ugh!
This is so silly!
Fashion is ridiculous!
I do!
I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!
What?
I was just bein' honest!
Why are you mad at me?
I was just sayin' what I thought!
And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?
For my honesty?
But it's my opinion!
And I'm not gonna lie!
What?
Why?
They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious.
You're right!
Apples are better than strawberries!
You'd better apologize!
What?
Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em!
But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about?
Oh, boy.
Nope.
No, it does not at all.
[sighs]
I am so sorry, Rarity.
I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel.
[sighs]
I'm a real rotten apple.
Yup.
But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.
Hey!
Whew... listen, y'all.
I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things.
But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful.
So for that, I apologize.
Uh, Well, I, uh, I still don't understand it.
But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it.
I also know this contest is important to Rarity.
So what do you say?
Anything.
Show's back on, fellers!
Ahhh, Aah!
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you.
Uh, Heh.
U-Uh, Uh...
Sorry, but I couldn't pick just one.
They all did great, and in my opinion, they all deserve to win.
Is, uh, this one of your new designs, Rarity?
It's, uh, Uh, the form is, reminiscent of, uh, I mean, it conjures up images of, uh, well, uh, I-I mean, Hah.
Oh, thank goodness.
'Cause in my honest opinion, it's awful.
I am relieved!
Is everythin' okay?
We heard a lot of oh-my-gosh-in', and we weren't sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing.
Just go with it, hon.
Hey!
I'll bring apples.
This season's batch are extra juicy.
Hoo-wee!
Helpin' to fix an entire yak village sure takes a lot outta ya.
[chuckles]
Need some help with that, Pinkie Pie?
Glad you're back, sugarcube.
Just in time for breakfast for dinner.
[gasps]
Pear jam?
What were you thinkin'?
Quick!
Hide it!
The big deal is that there is a long-standing feud between the Apples and the Pears!
Why?
Well, uh, a-actually, I-I'm-I'm not really sure.
You have any idea, Big Mac?
Uh, what goes better with apple fritter flapjacks, caramel syrup or praline!
Listen, sugarcube.
Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk.
Best not bring it up.
Me, too.
But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who?
We can ask Goldie Delicious!
If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!
Well, Goldie, we were hopin' you could tell us about the, uh, feud with the Apples and the Pears.
Wait an apple-pickin' minute!
Bright Mac and Buttercup?
Those are our parents' names!
Are you sayin' our mother was a Pear?
I can't believe it!
How did we not know?
[sighs]
Is there a-anythin' else you can tell us about them?
[sighs]
That's all right, Goldie.
It was, nice just to hear?
Burnt Oak?
The firewood salespony?
I haven't seen him in ages.
You're right.
We're not here for that.
Then let's go!
Thanks, Burnt Oak!
Hi, Mrs Cake.
We heard you and our ma used to be real good friends, and we were hopin' you could tell us a bit about her.
Just like you, sugarcube!
Or rather, you're just like her!
I mean, I figured the Pears moved, but I didn't know all that stuff happened before with Granny and Grand Pear.
What?
What did he do?
I can't believe Grand Pear just up and left Ma like that!
No wonder Granny never told us about any of this.
It seems to me that now's as good a time as any.
I'm Applejack, and this here's Big McIntosh.
But you already know who we are, don't ya?
We've been all over.
Learnin' about our parents.
And our grandfather.
Hearin' their story makes me feel closer to them somehow.
Nothing's keepin' ya from us now.
Let's not miss anythin' else.
If anything's gonna make it through, it's apples and pears.
Hoo-wee!
It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe.
Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash.
That's amazin'!
A perfect copy!
W-We always said we wanted to.
I need a hundred blankets, and I need 'em now!
Sorry, Twilight.
I don't need nothin' fancy.
I'm popular, Twilight!
I'm popular, and I don't like it one bit!
They call themselves the Sweet Apple Admirers.
They say they read my journal entries, and they felt like a part of the family.
And now they actually wanna become part of the family!
Yeah, you know, all the stuff about how friends are like family and whatnot?
And kick out my own family?
Granny Smith, hang on!
Let me help!
I didn't know where else to go!
I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and family-in' to do... I ain't got time for anythin' else!
It makes everythin' we've been through worth it.
Reckon we still have to deal with them, don't we?
Hey, kid, get over here!
Tents are lookin' good.
And we made good time today.
At this rate, we'll be at Winsome Falls by tomorrow!
Then it wouldn't be annual.
And if we did it every weekend, it probably wouldn't be as special.
Like those light thingies?
Fly-ders!
Everypony, run for cover!
Don't get stuck in their, web.
Flyders are from the Luna Bay area.
Never seen 'em this far east, though.
Probably attracted to the food.
Best wait here until they're gone.
That's right!
And if you girls want to, maybe we could tell some stories to pass the time.
I was thinkin' more like campfire stories?
Wow.
That was brave.
Don't worry, Scootaloo.
I was gonna tell you mine and Apple Bloom's favorite legend.
Well, it's true.
Rockhoof was known far and wide for his incredible strength.
But he didn't start out that way.
You see, Rockhoof was a tiny little fella, the son of a farmer.
They lived in a village that sat at the foot of a gigantic volcano.
And the village was protected by an elite group of guard ponies called the Mighty Helm.
Young Rockhoof wanted nothing more than to be part of the Mighty Helm.
But he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village.
But Rockhoof wouldn't take no for an answer.
Then, one fateful day, the volcano erupted!
The molten lava poured down the side of the volcano, and try as they might, the Mighty Helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village!
They had to evacuate.
But the village ponies didn't wanna leave their homes.
They spent their entire lives there.
They had nowhere else to go!
So Rockhoof decided to do something crazy.
He thought if he could divert the flow of the lava, he might be able to save his village.
He started diggin' a trench!
Good thing Rockhoof didn't believe in the word impossible.
He continued to work, knowin' the odds were against him, but determined to push through it.
Then, somethin' magical happened.
Rockhoof got visibly stronger!
But the lava was getting' closer.
Through his extraordinary determination and sheer force o' will, Rockhoof more than earned his place in the Mighty Helm.
Well, like it or not, we're food, too.
Let's all just stay calm.
Let me re-light this fire...
Lemme guess, it's about you?
Yeah, I guess he kinda reminds me of you.
Hey, do you hear that?
Exactly!
Those gosh-darn Fly-ders are gone!
We can get out!
Whoa!
We're gonna have to see if we can get out the other way.
Huh.
Well, what do you know?
We found ourselves a shortcut to Winsome Falls!
We sure are sorry that our camping trip wasn't what we hoped it would be.
Wait, you three wanna stay?
Is that all?
That's just it.
It looks like we hired a new milkmaid...
Just a little down-home ingenuity.
[laughs nervously]
But it's Rarity.
If anypony can turn lemons into lemonade, it's her.
Okay, Rarity, you've done just about enough sulkin'!
Havin' a fabulous mane is a wonderful thing, but it ain't the only thing!
A friend so generous that she once chopped off her own tail to help a sea serpent.
Well, Rarity, if you wanted to shine from the inside out, I think this afternoon, you became the brightest filly in Equestria!
Yes, Rarity.
It's been months.
Your mane looks fine.
We had a little talk with Photo Finish.
Luckily, you don't have to say anything.
Your style speaks for itself.
Pinkie Pie?
Pinkie Pie!
Whooooaaaa!
Party-planning cave.
Right.
You okay?
Or are you just screamin' for fun?
But everypony loves your pies.
They're the greatest thing since sliced apples.
And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before.
Um, I, thought I had.
That's why I said it?
Maybe I haven't...
I really don't think that's what's happening.
Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness.
We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies.
I don't think that's what I did.
Also, uh, how do you get out of here?
Yeah.
Is there anything else you're lyin' about that we should know?
Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway.
Uh, I could've told her that.
Hold on a second now.
All those legendary ponies were real, too?
And they went off with Star Swirl to face the Pony of Shadows, and then none of them were ever heard from again?
Luckily, she's got a whole bushel o' helpers right here.
Twilight, we've been studyin' and referencin' and cross-referencin' for three days straight now.
It'd take a whole team of ponies to clear away all this brush.
Which was what?
They did what now?
So they got stuck, too!
But you'd be savin' all the Pillars, right?
A-And they disappeared ages ago.
Rockhoof's shovel!
Oh, I can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me.
Probably.
I bet if you told somepony else the story, it might sound preposterous.
I hope you don't think you're the only one to find her artifact, because this here shovel says otherwise.
All those legendary ponies were real, too?
And then none of them were ever heard from again?
Y'all mean the Elements came from you?
I bet the Pony of Shadows would've loved the Ghastly Caverns before a thousand years of erosion turned it into the Ghastly Gorge.
Beggin' your pardon, Mr the Bearded!
But Twilight doesn't do anythin' halfway!
The Hollow Shades.
I think a branch of the Apple family lives there.
And it'll be an honor to save Equestria with y'all.
Look!
Wow!
Those are all the places we went when we left to save Equestria!
Y'all think that's why the map grew?
Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
I don't know about all this.
And you're sure you want us to be teachers?
In classrooms?
Why don't I show you around before you destroy the place?
Everypony?
I mean, everyone, go to your next class!
I just can't believe it.
Fights breakin' out when they're supposed to be learnin' friendship?
Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
Exactly!
What you need is a double dose of Granny Smith's apple mash.
Bad idea.
Uh, pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that.
Well, in that case, we're behind you one hundred percent, Twilight.
Roundin' up the pony students ain't gonna be an issue, but it won't be the same without 'em.
We're open and ready to start teachin'?
They're probably just off hidin' somewhere.
Huh.
He was at the farm this mornin' pickin' up a wagonload of apples...
To be honest, we felt exactly the same way when Twilight told us she was reopening the school.
Nope.
Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?
Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you.
She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!
[sighs]
Told ya it was bad.
So, when did you ride it?
[sighs]

Why do I feel like you're about to ask me a mighty big favor?
Absolutely!
On one condition.
You tag along with a few other ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.
No, no, of course not.
I mean Granny Smith and the rest of the Gold Horseshoe Gals.
Grand Auntie Applesauce, cousin Apple Rose, and cousin Goldie Delicious.
Why, I'm sure they'd be plumb tickled to have you join their annual grandmares' trip to Las Pegasus.
It'll be perfect.
I'll teach your classes, and you can look after them for me.
So they don't get too carried away.
Usually Big Mac goes along as a chaperone, but I'm sure he'd love a break.
So you don't mind missin' your only chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder?
That's the spirit!
Now skedaddle so I can help them get ready.
It's, uh, gonna take a while.
Here.
I made a list to help you keep the grandmares out of trouble.
Don't wanna have to bring 'em back home before you get to go on your rollercoaster.
Only if you don't follow the rules.
These grannies need a lot of care.
If one of 'em overdoes it, it's bye-bye Las Pegasus for the lot of ya.
And don't let 'em out of your sight.
Ever.
You'll find time.
And you might even learn a thing or two about havin' a good time from these old gals.
All right, y'all!
Time to get this show on the road!
[chuckles]
Or in the sky, in this case.
Puh!
Wormy apple cores, Pinkie!
How many times have I told you to keep your special effects away from my sets?
Ugh.
Yeehaw!
We get to put on our show?
Grrrr, Pinkie!
Why in tarnation are y'all gettin' so starstruck?
We've met Princess Celestia before.
Plenty of times.
Heh.
Aw, quit frettin'.
It's only a couple o' pals gettin' together to put on a ones-versary play.
What could go wrong?
Uh, honestly?
Yeah.
Our lead actress is a disaster!
Ya need to tell Celestia the truth, Twilight.
Be honest with Celestia and give the lead role to somepony else?
Twilight, you know truth is a huge part of friendship.
Pinkie Pie!
Tell her the truth finally?
You go find Celestia.
We'll figure out a way to stall this thing 'til you get back.
You're just in time.
But it's gonna be me.

Again?
I'm your pony, Twilight!
Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.
[chuckles]
I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
Of course!
Hey, y'all!
Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?
[chuckles nervously]
With us in charge.
Meanin' mostly me.
Heh.
Don't mind if I do!
Everycreature, follow the leader!
Now take a good, deep breath.
What do you smell?
Nope.
Try again.
And, Anyone?
Anyone?
The promise of, teamwork!
That there's an apple shed.
And this here is what we're gonna use to build it.
Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.
Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash.
Just Teacher of the Month kind o' ponies.
That's it!
Measure twice and cut once!
Haste makes waste!
Slow and steady!
Rainbow Dash!
Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.
They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done right!
Steady, Steady, Take 'er nice and slow...
Little to the left, Uh, a hair to the right, Now, a hoof shavin' higher...
I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
[sighs]
You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer.
Stroooooke, Stroooooke, Stroooooke, Slower...
Focus on your paddle technique, y'all.
Stop!
Right!
If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!
You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
I hope you're happy.
I did not!
Did not!
We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
H-Hold up, Twilight.
Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet.
You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed.
Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the?
Right as rain and twice as fresh!
See?
We're agreein' already.
Well, look at that.
The path splits up ahead.
Left or right?
Where to, Rainbow Dash?
Aw, heck.
Forget about me.
You want to go right, we'll go right.
Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie?
But it's up to you.
Hey!
Where are y'all goin'?
Up to you, Rainbow Dash.
I insist.
Heh.
But I insisted first.
Uh, yup!
All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free.
That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.
Nope!
There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
Togetherness!
Only as right as you are!
I'm goin' with your idea!
Vines!
No buts about it!
Why use a branch when you can use a vine?
Whoa!
Come on now...
These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!
Let me try.
Mm-hmm.
And they look mighty hungry.
I hate to admit it, but, this whole mess is kinda our fault.
So what do ya say?
You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
[sighs]
You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
And y'all did it together!
To tell you the truth, yeah.
Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!

You were more like fandanglin'!
Incomin'!

That's friendship in action, y'all!

What in tarnation?
Apple Bloom!
You know better than to leave our good tools out like that!
And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?
What's gotten into you?
Those chores are your responsibility!
Farm work is family work!
Ahhh.
So that's what this is all about.
Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now... startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!
They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school.
Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?
That attitude right there is why I brought the whole kit and caboodle.
I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family campin' experience!
Uh, let's see here.
Uh, all right.
I got a bandana!
I am!
For campin'?
How ya doin', Starlight?
We'll split up and search for her.
We can all meet back at the Tree.
Starlight, take the navigation gear and?
Where's Starlight?
Rarity, what in the hay are you gonna do with a fishin' rod?
Well, somethin' sure ain't right.
Hang on.
I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.
Sorry, y'all.
We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff.
What?
You know I ain't no liar!
Where's all your gear?
Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff.
Spoken like a true camper.
Do y'all know what this means?
There won't be any teachers left to run the school!
Problem is we don't even know how long we'll be gone.
Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?
What is that thing?
I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.
Anypony else think that sounded like an apple core cut up in a pulp grinder?
She just started playin'.
She's bound to get better.
Right?
We need to do somethin' about Pinkie Pie's playin'!
And thanks to her fruit-blastin' melodies, I got an orchard full of nothin' but applesauce!
And it ain't even saucin' season!
I mean, I know we said we should all be supportive, but Pinkie's been playin' for moons now, and she's not gettin' any better.
Oh, no, no, no!
We're not goin' through that again!
Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?
Actually, we do have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone.
All right.
In all honesty... uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!
Yeah!
Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she can do well.
Hoo-whee!
That's a great idea!
[sighs]
My party cannon idea was a real dud.
Sure is!
Okay, who's gonna get her?
Uh, Gummy?
You were supposed to bring Pinkie Pie.
What happened?
What in tarnation is goin' on here?
Well, can I ask you a question?
Uh, Rarity?
She did say that.
I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!
Pinkie's gotta be around here somewhere.
Excuse us.
Just hear us out.
Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable.
Absolutely.
So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!
Well, I'd understand if you were.
It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples.
Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?
Hoo-wee!
Looks like all of Ponyville is here.
Except for Rainbow Dash.
[chuckles]
This may be the fastest friendship problem you ever solved.
Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?
And we can already tell you're a smash with the class.
[chuckles]
Rockhoof?
We know you're used to bein' a hero, Rockhoof.
Only what we need here is a teacher.
I-I thought you were gonna try him out at the post office.
Then maybe they can show Rockhoof how they did it.
Get him used to livin' in this time.
Aww.
I'm sure once you see your old pal Flash Magnus, you'll feel right at home.
Wow... guess he wished he could take a nap?
Yeah!
And I bet Stygian took plenty o' time to fit in.
Now this here's a right mash of apples.
'Stead of solvin' Rockhoof's problem, we made him feel even worse.
Uh, why do the Hippogriffs need ships if they can turn into seaponies?
Yee-haw!
Rockhoof did it!
Really?
What?
What do you mean, Twilight?
We've been on one together before.
Heh.
Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.
Aw, it's just a name.
It doesn't mean anythin'.
Fair point.
So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?
Now we know why the Map called us.
Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll get that friendship problem solved, no matter what kind o' creature has it.
Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times.
There's nothin' to be sca?
We get the picture.
Why?
Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of.
Yah!
Those must be the Peaks of Peril.
Whew.
Tough goin', huh, Fluttershy?
Fluttershy?
Yah!
Fluttershy!
What are you doin'?
This is no time for visitin' varmints!
We're on a friendship quest, remember?
Come on!
We're burnin' daylight!
Now, we gotta get up that peak!
I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half?
[chuckles]
Sorry, Fluttershy.
I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.
Show yourself!
Well, hi.
I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy.
Huh.
Quiet bunch, ain't they?
We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all.
S-So, uh... what are your names? 
Ap-ple-jack!
Flut-ter-shy!
Remember?
You.
Un-der-stand.
Ponish?
Don't or won't?
Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?
Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?
These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall.
Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak.
[chuckles]
Beautiful day, ain't it?

Knock, knock!
Now you say, Who's there?
Uh-oh!
I feel a sneeze comin' on!
Aaaa-CHOOOOO!

Don't any o' y'all talk?
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Tell you what, sugarcube.
You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin.
I'll go and try to find one that talks.

Phew!

Have you seen a Kirin that talks?
Any idea where I should look?
Oh, for the love of Celestia!
Can't ya just say somethin'?
That, was somethin', all right.
Oh, wow.
[gasps]
This, is amazin'.
I was gonna say it's pretty.
But yeah.
Whoa there.
Vow of silence?
I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?
[sighs]
You'd rather not talk about it?
I-I under?
[gasps]
I can't believe it!
Nopony should give up feelin' their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!
[gasps]
I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!
Right... well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like.
Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.
There's no cure left?
[sighs]
Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy.
I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!
Fluttershy!
Guess what!
Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.
Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.
I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem.
Was somethin' lost in translation?
Heh.
That seemed less scary when it was in a song.
But that's no reason to stop talkin'.
Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.
There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!
'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!
Aw, shucks!
We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement!
Honest!
To the Stream of Silence!
If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!
It's all right.
I think I know this one.
And she's tryin' to help.
You have no idea.
Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.
And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.
I know you're worried about fightin'.
But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.
What?
When do we ever argue?
We don't always see eye-to-eye.
But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.
I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
Well, it would be.
Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.
They're called foal's-breath.
Uh, Fluttershy?
A little help?
Well, what are we waitin' for?
Lead the way!
Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here.
I owe you an apology.
'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower.
[chuckles]
Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?
It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
Mm-hmm.
With her friends by her side, she won't have to.
You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all.
Granny's Apple Core No-Bite-No-More!
That'll keep the flies off.
Let me guess.
You got bad news, too?
Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could actually help?
Cockatrice!
That looks like a yes.
Which little protg?
But Starlight's in charge at the school.
If anypony can stop Cozy Glow, it's her.
Tirek said all of Equestria's magic would be gone at sunset.
You can drop the act, Cozy Glow!
Your pen pal Tirek told us all about how he helped you suck up all that magic!
Don't you think you're bein' a little paranoid?
Did y'all call us down here just to tell us that?
Well, if the princesses think it's time to retire, we're not a bad choice.
We always have Equestria's best interests at heart.
It's not a bad thing.
We just know you have a, process.
Huh.
Do Flim and Flam count?
Handlin' things on our own is all well and good, but last time we defeated Sombra with the Crystal Heart.
And easy.
Knowing you?
Nope.
What's goin' on?
Don't you dare say it!
What the?
Twilight, what are you doin'?
Move over, y'all!
Apple Bloom!
It's me!
Look at me, sugarcube!
Twilight, you gotta free her!
Please!
We've been at this for hours, but it's just growin' back too fast!
I know we're supposed to be able to handle things on our own, but I've never been happier to see two ponies in my whole life!
Well, we'd better figure out somethin' quick, because none of them seem to have a problem with it!
We promise we'll let y'all out as soon as we can!
And holdin' them off isn't what we need anyhow!
We need to get inside!
At least we're inside.
That's it, then?
We're doomed?
But y'all just don't seem to remember.
He sure has a weird way of bein' supportive.
Nowhere else I'd rather be.
Whew.
That's a barrel and a half of obstacles.
Plus a bushel and a peck of impenetrability.
Absolutely not.
That's, definitely unexpected.
How about somethin' a little more down-to-earth?
Like, I distract the guard ponies with a farewell performance by my alter ego, famous country-western superstar Apple Chord!
Well, it's a long story.
Back on the farm, playin' music was about makin' her family smile.
Word of her talent spread, and soon, Apple Chord was playin' real shows.
The more she played, the bigger those shows got.
But she missed playin' for her family... so one day, she gave it all up.
Seein' her family smile was all she ever wanted from her music.
Of course, Apple Chord could come out of retirement for a farewell concert this one time.
Um... Applejack?
[laughs]
Who's that?
My name's Apple Chord, and I've got a couple of songs to play for ya.
Clap your hooves if you know 'em!
I know that one's a crowd favorite.
What say we play it one more time?
And a one, and a two, and a?
A distraction's a distraction.
I'm strong, Twilight, but not even I can buck through solid rock.
Welcome to Sweet Apple Acres, Yona.
Rarity tells us you need some help gettin' ready for the big dance.
It's part of the Ponyville dance tradition.
Everypony brings a dish to share, and we swap 'em without knowin' whose is whose.
Although my lucky pot probably gives me away.
[laughs]
Let's try somethin' a little simpler.
I'm sure we can do somethin' with these.
O-kay.
Applesauce it is.
How 'bout that?
And she's good!
Yona, you did it!
[chuckles]
It's not your fault, sugarcube.
No pony-ness required.
I know we've had this day marked on the calendar for quite a while, but it's finally here.
The Confluence.
A harvest a hundred moons in the makin'.
When every apple comes ripe at the same time.
Big Mac's been up late workin' on this schedule so we can be sure not to miss a single tree.
All it'll take now is a few days o' hard work.
Who's with me?
That's great, Granny!
Twilight and the others are too busy at the school to lend a hoof.
We could sure use some more muscle.
Who'd you get?
Braeburn?
Honeycrisp?
Well, with a harvest this big, we're grateful for all the help we can get.
I guess.
The Great Seedlin'?
Well now.
I haven't thought about that old mare's tale for years.
Well, I'm pretty sure she's outgrown the whole thing by now.
Right, Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom, you haven't hunted for the Great Seedlin' since you were little.
Why would you want to start again now?
Don't forget we have actual work to do, too!
I don't mind Apple Bloom havin' fun.
But there's honest-to-goodness work to do that doesn't have a thing to do with an old legend.
Granny's right.
Come on, sleepyhead.
Let's get to work.
Hyah!
Hwah!
As much as I appreciate her volunteerin', I'm not sure how much help Goldie's gonna be.
I love hearin' her and Granny spinnin' yarns, but it looks like the harvestin's up to us.
You're gonna have to redo that schedule.
And as much as I'd rather Apple Bloom were helpin', I guess there's no harm in her huntin' the Great Seedlin' for a day.
Right?
Big Mac!
We fell behind a bit yesterday, so we need everypony at their best.
He was just up late workin' out a new schedule so we can stay on track.
I hope you're ready to cheer Apple Bloom up when her traps come up empty.
What in blazes is all the excitement about?
Neither can I.
Now, why would you go and do a thing like that?
You know what I mean.
We got enough work to do without you distractin' Apple Bloom by makin' some apple tracks and pretendin' the Great Seedlin' did it.
Well, somepony did it.
And she sure seems to be enjoyin' this quite a lot.
Uh-huh.
And I suppose you two didn't do it either?
Ha-ha.
Very funny.
Apple Bloom?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I know you're excited, but we sure could use your help today.
Are you sure you want to spend time tryin' to catch somethin' that might not even be real?
I don't know who made the tracks.
But I don't think it was the Great Seedlin'.
Because the Great Seedlin' is just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns.
And you're old enough now to know that there's a time for fun and there's a time for work.
[sighs]
All right.
How about this?
If you help me with the harvest today, I'll help you set traps for the Great Seedlin' tonight.
Deal?
Kinda looks like those Seedlin' tracks, huh?
Well, if enough apples fell or got knocked down by the wind maybe.
Or animals.
I'm just sayin' there's a lot of possible explanations.
And the rest of 'em ain't!
And missed out on helpin' with the harvest because I was chasin' somethin' for little foals.
I felt guilty everypony else had to work harder because of me.
So I decided right then and there I was too old to waste any more time on Great Seedlin'.
Then let's get to work.
[laughs]
I forgot what a good time it could be.
If any two ponies can catch the Great Seedlin', it's us.
Now, there's still plenty of harvestin' to do.
So promise me you'll help, even if all our traps are empty.
[laughs]
Deal.
Now that's what I like to hea?
Whoa.
Huh?
Every trap sprung?
No way critters did this.
Or the wind.
I can't believe I'm sayin' this, but maybe the Great Seedlin' really was here!
I can't think of anything else that could've laid out these tracks and sprung all our traps.
Well, tell us what you have seen!
Goldie, you too!
We need to know it all if we're really gonna catch him!
Work?
Apple Bloom and I don't have time to work today!
We've got to set up traps in every row!
Even the carrots!
Just to be sure!
That was before I thought we could actually catch him!
Besides, Big Mac can make time in the schedule for us to set traps, right?
Great!
Get to it!
Apple Bloom and I are gonna go capture us the Great Seedlin'!
Whew!
All right!
Just one more hill to go!
Huh.
Is this right?
But that doesn't make any sense.
How can all these trees be bare if we haven't bucked 'em yet?
You're sayin' the Great Seedlin' is takin' our apples?
Have you ever heard of anypony actually catchin' him?
Well, his tricks have given me an idea.
Settin' traps is one thing.
But I reckon if we keep watch over the trees that haven't been bucked, the Seedlin' won't know what hit him!
Guess it's just you and me.
[chuckles]
Me, too.
It's been a long time since I was on a real Seedlin' hunt.
And this is the first time doin' it with my little sister.
I couldn't have been much more than a foal.
I remember our parents tuckin' Big Mac and me in and tellin' us all about the Great Seedlin'.
And I got so excited, I could barely sleep.
So I?
Don't you worry, sugarcube.
I won't let him get away.
Huh?
W-What is it?
Well, let's go check it out!
See anything?
Don't scare him off.
We got to lead him into one of the traps.
Apple Bloom!
Wait!
Huh?
Huh?
He's been harvestin' in his sleep this whole time!
Y-You okay, Big Mac?
And thanks to all of Big Mac's late-night work, we brought in the whole harvest with time to spare.
You know what, sugarcube?
You're never too old to be a filly.
There will always be work to do, but havin' fun together is somethin' you never grow out of.
[chuckles]
We're real glad you came, Goldie.
Huh.
Big Mac wasn't harvestin' the carrots.
Just the apples.
You know what this means?
Look out, Great Seedlin'!
Here we come!
And why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop!
Y'all think they're gonna be doin' this a lot?
And then they carried Granny Smith across the street.
There wasn't even any traffic!
The what now?
Uh, we're fillin' in for Their Majesties.
What can we help y'all with?
Did you even know there were royal street carpeters?
Pinkie!
You got those appetizers yet?
Uh...
Now, who can we get to clean up all this garbage?
She sure had a burr in her britches about somethin'.
Heh.
What do they make there?
Rubber chickens?
Whoa-whoa-whoa.
What did you say?
And you don't sound so worried about findin' your life's purpose anymore.
Well, well, well, if it ain't our reignin' champ.
Think you can win again this week, Twilight?

[laughs]
I'm not sure you wanna take that job, Spike.
The score-keepin' can get a mite intense.
I didn't hear you complain when the category was Wonderbolt History.
Now, why would I choke on a question about apples?
Uh, What was the question again?
Nyah!
What are you doin' here?
Pinkie, you and I are givin' Braeburn and the Appleloosan ponies some adjustments to the menu.
If anypony can handle some last-minute bakin', Braeburn, it's y'all.
I sure am proud o' her.
Braeburn?
W-What's wrong?
What the, Everything was fine a minute ago!
Twilight, w-we're sorry, but?
Explain to me why we didn't tell her the truth.
Well, what do y'all suggest?
I guess.
There's gotta be a reason.
Something got 'em all sick.
Maybe the food?
I told y'all this was a bad idea!
But nopony ever listens to me!
Everythin' was goin' fine.
About that, We just wanted to say we're real sorry.
And how's that?
[gasps]
Rarity, Spike's been followin' you closely since he got to Ponyville.
And in case you hadn't noticed, I AIN'T SPIKE!
I wish I could, sugarcube.
But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.
Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more important than havin' fun.
Speakin' of which, don't you even think about tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you.
You could end up in hot water or worse.
Twilight!
There you are!
You mind tellin' your friend here that I don't need an official guard wherever I go?
Especially if he ain't gonna help carry apples?
It was the strangest thing.
He kept callin' me Earth pony, like I didn't have a name.
And watchin' me like he thought I'd steal the silver!
Get to the point, Discord.
For all the time you've spent with us, you really haven't picked up too much in the way of friendship lessons, huh?
We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!
We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!
We gotta find Twilight.
She's probably already figured out some way to defeat those monsters.
Get Twilight!
That ain't right.
Everypony's scared, that's all.
We just need to get to Ponyville and find Twilight pronto.
She'll know how to set things right.
Where'd all these ponies come from?
Twilight's probably as worried as everypony else and tryin' to find somewhere safe.
That's why I was sure she'd be waitin' for us in Ponyville.
Where else could she be?
You want the truth, Twilight?
Bad things happen.
No matter what you do, there's never gonna be a time when everything's perfect.
But that don't mean you quit tryin'!
The truth is, all our lives wouldn't be the same if we hadn't met.
We're better off because of our friendship with you.
So when you say you haven't made a difference, that's just not true.
You've made a big difference to us.
I'd say they have an idea.

Ya sure can!
Way to go, Twilight!
How 'bout that?
It's just like you said the day we opened that school.
Thank goodness.
First question, your Highness.
What do we do with all these creatures?
Well, mostly quiet.
Of course not.
Change is natural, like the seasons.
That's just life on the farm.
Anyhoo, I really need to get all these boxes packed and sorted.
There's a lot more work now that the folks beyond Equestria are comin' to the coronation, too.
All right, Twilight.
Are you ready?
We all wanted to see you off, but there's still a lot to do.
I gotta go with Big Mac so we can go over our packin' list or we won't know who gets what deliveries.
Of course we care that you're movin', Twilight.
I knew you were worried about everything changin'.
I guess I thought if I made it seem like everything was okay, it would be.
Eeyup.
What if we don't stay friends?
I hope Big Mac can figure out who gets what deliveries on his own.
To Twilight!
And we all chipped in some.
Hoo-wee!
Your very first princess summit.
You must be over the moon, Twilight.
You've got no reason to fret, Twi.
Everything's gonna be just?
You do realize that's not a real word, right?
Somebody order a dozen cases of fizzy apple cider?
Can you bring in the rest?
Hey, I know you.
Sure.
You're the new girl who gave Sunset Shimmer the what for today.
I'd think twice about that.
Oh, sure, she'll probably approach you all friendly like...
I sure am lookin' forward to some friendly competition.
That's so good to hear.
But then, here comes the backstabbin'.
About the only girl in this school you can trust less than Sunset Shimmer is Rainbow Dash.
She's also the captain of sayin' she's gonna do somethin' for ya, and then turnin' around and not even botherin' to show up.
Huh, suit yourself.
Hey, how'd you know my name is Applejack?
Uh-huh.
If you say so.
Well, now, it ain't necessarily gonna be your coronation this time around.
Grrr...
There you are, Twilight.
I've been lookin' all over for ya!
Listen to y'all carryin' on!
Get over it and move on!
She said she'd get the softball team to make an appearance at my bake sale.
I tell everybody they're comin', and then not one of 'em shows up!
She made a liar outta me!
That's different!
Is too!
Hmm.
The Freshman Fair.
Y'all remember?
Maybe she's the reason Rainbow Dash didn't show up for my bake sale!
Heh, I guess I kinda stopped talkin' to her at all after that.
Somebody, and I think we can all guess who, told Rainbow Dash that my bake sale had been moved to a different day.
Dash showed up with all the softball team and thought I'd cancelled on her!
All right, girls.
Dance is tomorrow night, and we still don't know how we're gonna get Twilight the votes she needs to be named princess.
Right now, folks only know the Twilight from the videos Sunset Shimmer posted online.
We need to help 'em see her differently.
Don't know what she's smilin' about.
Twilight's the one that's gonna be Princess of the Fall Formal.
You okay?
Wait a minute!
Lemme get this straight.
You're a pony?
Now that's the kinda can-do spirit I'm lookin' for in a Fall Formal Princess!
Let's do it, y'all!
I can't believe you were gonna do that for us!
Oh, we were so worried.
What'd ya eat?
Oooh!
Somepony's got a crush on the new guy!
Well, whatcha looking for?
Sounds to me like this is a makin' for a nice, friendly competition.
Pinkie!
Whoa!
That gal probably just wants to make some sort of grand entrance.
Told ya.
Guess you're gonna express your full musicality clear across campus.
Well, look at that!
Well, then, how about ya take that keytar and move your tail to our next rehearsal space?
Okay, Granny, one more time.
When ya accidentally sold my bass at the garage sale, who did ya sell it to?
I'd like that bass.
Listen, Granny never should've sold my bass.
I'll give ya the two dollars back and we'll call it even.
It is.
That's my bass.
[sighs]
Come on down to the grand opening of the Flim Flam Brothers' Everything Under the Sun Emporium.
Hey, did I just come in last?
Uh, Fluttershy, you've got a little somethin', uh...
Heh, not exactly.
To be honest, I'd say the whole experience brought everyone at Canterlot High closer than ever before!
I just wonder why it happens.
Princess Twilight took her crown back to Equestria.
Shouldn't that mean she took all the magic back with her?
Sorry, Flash.
I don't think Twilight's gonna be back at Canterlot High any time soon.
But the important thing is that you've turned yourself around.
So how was the tour?
Don't worry, y'all.
We'll let Principal Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb in no time.
Last thing she needs is another CHS event almost ruined by some power-crazed lunatic.
Er, no offense.
The Dazzlings?
They did?
Pinkie Pie's right.
We were there when the Dazzlings were singin' and we weren't affected.
It was like we were protected somehow.
But Star Swirl must have sent them there ages ago.
How come they're just surfacin' now?
We get the idea!
Don't suppose we could join you this time around?
For starters, a certain blue-haired guitar player was just askin' about you.
We've got nothin' to worry about now that Twilight's back.
Yup.
Ears, tails, the whole shebang.
Guess the Rainbooms are the band to beat.
It's our band!
And, of course, as lead singer.
She's the one with the magical know-how to help us pull this thing off.
Where're you goin'?
Hey!
I was about to beat you!
Hey!
Darn tootin'.
You're turnin' what should be the chorus into a five-minute guitar solo?
We're tryin' to save our school here.
Enough with the costumes!
Then we'll have to buy ourselves some time so you can keep workin' on it!
Least we know one group who won't stand in the way of us gettin' to the finals.
Guh, Rarity, were you tryin' to make us lose out there?
Yeah, well, whoever did this couldn't have done this if you didn't insist on dressin' like, like, this!
We need to sound good!
Is there some reason that concept seems to escape you?
Come on, Twilight.
We've got things to do.
Don't worry, Twilight.
Finals aren't until tonight.
We'll get in a little more practice before we're supposed to hit the stage.
We won't let you down!
None of this would've happened if you weren't tryin' to show off, as usual.
Yup, 'cause that's the real tragedy here, Rarity, that you won't get to play dress-up!
Give it up, Rainbow Dash.
You've been tryin' at this for hours.
It's not gonna open.
Of course it would have worked, Twilight.
Assumin' a certain band member didn't try to hog the spotlight the whole time we were tryin' to play it!
It might've been your idea to start a band, but it's not just your band, Rainbow Dash!
Again with the costumes!
No one cares what we're wearin'!
How can they be using our magic?
It's the magic of friendship.
Come on, y'all!
Time to prove we've still got the magic of friendship inside us!
We're about to save the world here.
Personally, I think we should do it in style.
Rarity?
Sure wish you could stay longer.
I can relate to workin' hard outdoors, but what the hay does that have to do with us playin' music?
Well, Sunset, I was just tellin' Rainbow Dash here that a broken guitar string doesn't really qualify as an emergency.
You comin', Sunset?
Well, that's a relief.
The last thing we need is another magical so-and-so bent on world domination comin' over from Equestria.
Because the Crystal Prep Shadowbolts are our biggest rivals?
Well, it's kinda hard to get along with someone who beats you at everything.
Is anybody else wonderin' how Dash ponied up without playin' her guitar?
They won't even let us see what they're doin' to the field.
You think they'd at least tell competitors what they're competing in.
Well, when it comes to magic, I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Rarity, what'd you go an' do?
You really didn't have to.
Uh, Rarity, these outfits are great, but why would you put so much time and effort into clothes we might not even wear?
You're gonna exhaust yourself before the games even start.
I told you.
Well, I'll be.
You shoulda told us you were comin'.
She's a princess in Equestria.
Probably got problems of her own to deal with.
You're the one who helped us understand what was goin' on with the sirens.
Remember?
What do ya mean the portal's gone?
What in tarnation is she up to?
All right, everyone.
Let's not get too competitive before the games even start.
I'm sorry, Pinkie.
I thought your party additions were really swell.
Hey.
Where is that other Twilight?
That was as close to winnin' as Canterlot's ever been.
I don't know.
She doesn't seem like the magic-stealin' type.
Oh, it puts you on a playin' field, alright.
I don't suppose you made motocross outfits.
You said it.
Ugh!
I can't take anymore!
Ya have to stop aimin' at the target.
Ya have to stop aimin' at where the target is an' aim at where the target's gonna be.
Do you wanna hit the bullseye or not?
Then trust me.
Take a deep breath. 
And let the arrow go, riiiiight., now!
See?
I was tellin' ya the truth.
Eh, what, are, you, doing?
Is everybody all right?
Let's just get through this last event and prove we're not a bunch of cheaters.
Then you can go over and apologize.

Don't let go!
[sighs]
We're gonna be out in the woods.
When is she gonna need that?
I'm just lookin' forward to roughin' it.
I'm gonna make my own shelter, forage for food...
Yup!
Still gonna forage though.
Yep.
Canterlot High has become a regular magic magnet.
Gonna be nice gettin' away to a place where we don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Aquamarine.
Yee-hoo!
Heh.
Nothin'.
Huh.
I still can't believe you talked Gloriosa into havin' a fashion show.
We're in the middle of the woods, for cryin' out loud!
We're s'posed to be roughin' it!
Fair enough.
Just as long as you don't put me in one of your fancy pants outfits.
You're gonna, aren't ya?
Huh.
Or maybe we do!
If you ask me, this whole dock needs to go.
Building a new one could be our camp gift.
Sure, it would benefit us, but a nice new dock would benefit future campers, too.
Make it nice and sturdy.
More importantly, it will be a great place for docking canoes and feeding the wildlife.
Huh, nice hammer.
Where did you get it?
Hah, that's cool.
I made mine.
Uh, that was a terrifying story.
Why?
It can't be real.
Sounded more like something that Timber was makin' up just to scare us.
At least I hope it was.
Last thing I want is to have camp ruined by some power-crazed magical creature.
Dock.
Rainbow Dash!
Sorry, it's a little bit stuck.
Uh, I don't know what happened.
I didn't even pull the rope that hard.
It's like she was light as a feather all of a sudden.
It wasn't my fault!
Let me help you get your harness out.
Did you tell them what happened?
So crazy!
I hoisted Rarity up the rock climbin' wall like it was nothin'!
Like I had way more strength than I usually do.
Rarity!
Speaking of disappearing, has anybody seen Rainbow Dash?
Whoa!
How'd you do that?
[sighs]
So much for my theory that leavin' CHS would mean leavin' any new magic business behind.
I don't know about the rest of y'all, but I've been lookin' forward to comin' here for a month.
Maybe we forget about this new magic for a bit and just try to focus on enjoyin' our time at camp?
The dock is our gift to the camp, and it's gonna get finished.
That is, if Rainbow Dash would hurry up and bring me more wood.
Don't be silly.
[sighs]
I know I said we should try to forget all about this new magic business, but I can't.
What if I hammer the board into splinters?
Aw, shoot!
I'm all out of nails.
[sighs]
Thought you weren't finished with the stitching on your poncho.
It's alright, I guess.
I do get to keep it after camp though, right?
That's Gloriosa?
Am I goin' crazy, or are her feet not touchin' the ground?

Hmph.

This isn't working!
Her magic is too strong!
Sunset!
Rarity!
What, What are these?
Like a fundraiser?
I think you mean the dock?
It's all right.
We can just wash more cars.
There's gotta be some we missed.
Hee-yoo!
Now we're talkin'!
What's your idea?
You make it sound simple as pie.
[sighs]
Oh, what the hay?
Why not?
How about we forget about the other teams and get back to dancin'?
Everythin' all right, sugarcube?
Eh, maybe this was all for the best.
Uh, your concept and costumes are really awesome, but, uh, our dancin', We could barely get in a two-step without trippin' over each other's boots.
[laughs]
Yeah!
I-I got somethin'!
Okay, so we're in home-ec class, bakin' some apple fritters!
And then, a fresh batch comes outta the oven.
And everybody's havin' a great time!
[laughs]
Uh, I guess I'm just kinda hungry.
So what's the big plan you were excited about?
Yee-hoo!
We've got enough to make Camp Everfree look just like new!
I'd sure like to get a closer look at that volcano.
Is the number-one thing we didn't know that the guy who founded this studio was an eccentric oddball with a sweet tooth?
Hmm.
Wonder how long it takes to build somethin' like this.
They sure do go all out makin' it look like the real deal, huh?
Better pocket that.
Wouldn't want it ruinin' the shot.
Well, she might do somethin' like this if she was tryin' to get out of workin' on a movie she didn't want to do.
Where do we even start?
It's not like there's some mysterious, thievin', cloaked figure we can chase after and say, Hey, tell us where you're keepin' the relics!
Any luck findin' Chestnut?
Uh, I think there's been some kind of mistake.
Hey!
There she is!
Uh, what's this place supposed to be?
Stormy with a side of what, now?
We have to find Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash?
Where are ya?
Thinkin' maybe we should all start wearin' our geodes around.
Never know when our new magic might come in handy.
Huh.
I say we head back to the scene of the crime.
Maybe there's somethin' there that could lead us to the relics.
For sweet apples' sake, we only have bit parts in this flick.
We're not movie stars.
What's it say?
What in the blazes are you doin' here?
Somehow, some way, that dang Juniper sucked us all inside of that mirror of hers.
Is there really no way out of here?
You really think Princess Twilight would be okay with that?
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
Whoa, N-no, no!
I'm already gussied up just enough, thank you.


Oh, all right.
But nothin' too fancy, ya hear?
Uh, looks, great.
Heh.
Uh, maybe just a tad less blush.
And, uh, lipstick.
What the hay?
A bit of the eyeshadow too while you're at it.
A little more.
Wow!
Ha-ha!
You were right, Rarity!
You really are great at this!
Heh.
Thanks.
Hey!
This is the song I requested!
Care to cut a rug with your big sis, sugarcube?
[laughs]
Yee-haw!
Oh, we'll top it, all right.
Color me impressed!

Wow!
Winona looks cleaner than a whistle!
[laughs]
[laughs]
Wow!

Told y'all I'd find us a tour bus.
Ain't she a beaut?
Uh, heh heh.
Might need a little fixin' up.
[laughs]
So then Granny Smith is hootin' and hollerin', and Big Mac comes out of the barn with his hands over his head swattin' flies like ya wouldn't believe!
Heh-heh.
Uh, the quest?
[laughs]
It's Photo Day for all the clubs, and it's a Young Farmers' Club tradition to have your critter in the yearbook picture.
Well, Young Farmers is just one of the six clubs I'm in.
Well, the scores are in, and it's a darn-tootin' tie!
Gah!
At least between the two of us, we joined every single club at CHS.
Is that my pig?
Uh, Whoa!
What the hay is goin' on here?
It's that waterin' can, that's what!
It's got magic all over it!
Quick!
Try this!
The food!

[sighs]
Summer.
Ya know, there's nothin' like kickin' back and enjoyin' the?
If you want our help, just ask.
Any luck?
Hold yer horses!
Now I'm beepin'!
Are you kiddin'?
We haven't even done half the beach!
Who knows what else we'll find?
Uh, that's not it.
Is it?
You'll be hangin' ten in no time.
Twenty, even.

Let's quit hollerin' and hit the water then.
Whew!
Looks like a big one!
How would you tackle it?
Why on Earth would you try to hack it out there without knowin' how?
You could've got hurt!
I'm the substitute lifeguard today, and I'm ready to dive in headfirst.
What's the plan?
That's not my way.
Gotta be prepared.
Just doin' ma job, ma'am.
Uh, I got here first, so I just took care o' savin' that kid for ya.
You're welcome!
Giddy up!
See, this is what hard work can do.
I gotcha!
Why are you crying?
We're savin' you!
Yeah.
With my elbow grease and Timber's know-how, we actually make a pretty good team.
Let's do this together?
Yeehaw!
I think you've captured the fun of havin' a pet perfectly.
On today's DIY with Applejack, we're gonna build my friend Rarity a dream dressin' room, in just seventy-three easy steps!
Let's get started!
First, ya need wood.
So, for step one, I'm gonna cut down one of my trees.
Step eight, gettin' rid of splinters.
Now, ya have to give each square foot of the surface thirty clockwise strokes with the buffer...
Yes.
Thirty.
And then you have to double-check those strokes by?
Aw, shoot!
I lost count!
Well, I have to cut down a new tree.
Step twenty-nine, paintin' your room!
I chose this practical brown color...
Step twenty-nine-point-five, paintin' your room with this, uh, very bright purple.
Step forty-two, adding tufted button walls!
You're gonna wanna be careful, measurin' the satin at least twice...
Now that you've measured five times, we can begin to cut the samples.
We just have to figure out which of the sixty-two samples, work best.
Now the real fun begins!
Rarity!
Wake up!
Step seventy-three, the big reveal!
Yeah.
G'night, you two.
Uh, d-d-d-don't you think it's a, pinch chilly for this getup?
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-cold...
Howdy!
And welcome to the first annual Canterlot Pet Show!
Sure is great to be here, ain't it?
Heh.
All righty, then.
You heard the lady!
Let's meet 'em!
This is the backstage area, where the pets get fresh and spiffy before the competition.
Right, Fluttershy?
Why, look at this handsome feller!
Tell us about your pooch!
Uh, I think the show will be startin' soon, so we should wrap this up.
Winona?
What are you doin' back here?
Huh.
Yee-haw!
We gotta get ready to win that gold!
Giddyup!
What a show!
So many surprises and one too many jugglin' acts, if you ask me.
And now for the victory lap!
Here comes our participation winners!
Next up, our third place partners: Micro Chips and JVJ-24601.
Uh...
Hey, Fluttershy, does a robot count as a pet?
Uh, I mean, over to you, Fluttershy!
Our second place team sure knows how to put a game face on durin' a tough competition!
Huh.
You sure do have the inside scoop, Fluttershy.
And our big winners!
I dunno about you, Fluttershy, but I can't think of a more deservin' duo!
Everything's not in order!
Where's Pinkie Pie?
I was supposed to be in wood shop with Pinkie Pie, not frou-frou paintin' time with nobody.
Well, she wasn't lyin'.
Lunch technically is a class period.
Now, you're gonna be out in the hot sun all day long, so be sure to bring plenty of sunscreen.
But you don't really need all that.
I can think of two must-haves for makin' an outhouse feel like an in-house.
Bring your own TP and plenty of hand sanitizer.
You can't go three days without 'em?
[sighs]
And finally, you'll need a sleepin' bag for a few hours of shuteye.
And where are you plannin' to put all them pillows?
Excuse me!
What happened to bringin' only our must-haves?
Campin's about makin' do with what you got!
It's about breakin' off a stick to roast marshmallows or rustlin' up pine needles for deodorant!
Huh?
Well.
I think I'm gonna like glampin'.
Not to sound like Granny Smith, but why do y'all care so much about a filter?
All it does is make a new picture look old.
I'd never wear a dodecahedron.
Uh, we do that already.
I'll say.
What's this filter called, Pinkie Pie?
An old pair of cowboy boots will keep you from steppin' in a pile of uh... fashion emergency.
Yeeee-haw!
Oof!
Oh, apple fudge.
Can the next trend be a little less, messy, Rarity?
If Principal Celestia sees this, we'll be in trouble.
Let's get to cleanin'!
Party's over, Pinkie Pie.
I can't believe we're doin' Dazzled this year.
You know, I got just the trick for stage fright.
It ain't a contest.
But if it were, I'd win.
Surefirest cure for stage fright is to picture everyone in the audience as a bunch of chickens.
Heh.
A little cluck-cluck, and it'll pluck ya right up.
You never heard of this trick?
Everyone does it.
And I mean everyone.
Told ya.
Picture everyone in the audience as a bunch of chickens...
Heh.
Chicken trick worked, huh?
Heh.
Awww.
Well, I'm glad you were able to imagine it in one way or the other.
'Cause my backup plan wasn't so hot.
Speakin' of which, I should probably get them back to the farm.
Don't fret your fritters.
I can borrow Granny's truck.
Think nothin' of it.
I've been lookin' for a reason to take a spin in the old jalopy.
Whew.
I can't believe she's still in such good condition.
All right, Sunset.
Use that wrench to loosen the bolts, and we'll get this tire replaced in two shakes of an apple tree.
Well...
Well, last time I saw them together was, uh, when I was buildin' the mine shaft set over by the costume rack.
Uh, nobody thought that.
I'm the only one who applied, so... absolutely!
Construction's the quick part.
Like I always say: Measure twice, cut once.
But only after you measure three more times.
What?
What?
Waaah!
Whew!
But the play's this Friday!
Don't worry, Sunset.
I still got thi?
I guess I could use a hand.
Thanks a bushel for helpin' me build the set, Rainbow Dash.
Well, actually, Rainbow Dash, you really should take a look at this blueprint.
Slow down!
But ya need to measure more and cut less!
You're not measurin' enough!
Stoooop!
Hmm.
This doesn't look like the blueprints.
It's even better!
That ain't a green print.
That's, That's my vision board on green paper.
Green is my power color.
I sketched out all the stuff I wish I could build but knew I'd never have time, and you've just built it all.
Where'd you find this?
Are you sure you have time to help, Pinkie Pie?
Don't you need to practice your drum solo?
So you can't help me?
Pinkie!
Drum over here!
And over here!
I'll be honest.
I think you drummed up one heck of a set, Pinkie Pie.
So what we got here is a basic disco layout with a light-up dance floor and recessed cans to backlight the performance.
But how am I supposed to tell ya what to do?
Soooooooooooooo... what do I do?
Feel what?
What?
This doesn't look anything like it's supposed to.
You're makin' less sense than a jackrabbit on roller skates.
Whoa.
Thank you so much.
How's Coal Miner #2 doin'?
Don't be nervous.
It's only one line.
All you have to do is ring that bell and say, The mine is closed.
Yeah, that, but... maybe a little louder?
Go get 'em!
Fluttershy needs our help!
Quick!
I need a costume!
Ooh, pardon me.
Talkin' apple tree comin' through.
Oh, hello, coal mine.
Just me, the magical talkin' apple tree.
R-Remember, Fairy Bootmother?
You enchanted me?
Well.
Would ya look at that?
The bell's back where it needs to be.
Someone should really ring it.
Just flutter on over.
Don't be shy.
Hoo-wee!
What's the lowdown on the after-party hoedown?
I'm ready to throw down!
If he's gonna be stubborn about it, so can we.
Hey there, Mr Cranky Doodle.
I heard ya won't let us borrow your projector for our party.
I'm askin' nice.
Not leavin' without it.
Fine by me.
Got a sleepin' bag.
Air mattress, too.
Got an air pump.
Foot-powered.
Eat bananas for potassium.
You're right.
I can admit when I'm beat.
Ain't she a quiet one?
Now ya gone and done it!
That was different.
The whole school voted for her.
I prefer to take selfies myself...
Sunset Shimmer?
Askin' to be in our Best Friends picture?
Heh.
Now I've heard it all.
And we ain't friends.
You got applesauce in your ears?
I said, we ain't fr?
Whoa!
And exactly how is it you can see our memories, if you don't mind me askin'?
Like I'd ever say that.
Uh, That was different.
The whole school voted for her.
[sighs]
We may not remember you...
Nothin'.
You?
Rarity and I applied for summer jobs at the new theme park.
Actually, they pay us to go there.
We applied to work side-by-side as caramel apple girls.
[chuckles]
We'll be together.
I got a good feelin'.
It's from the park!
Okay, okay.
Same time.
One, two...
I didn't get the job.
But I'm really happy for you, Rarity.
Just a sale at Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium.
What?
You cannot let this opportunity pass you by, Rarity.
Think of all those vision boards, the late-night sewin'.
This has been your dream since... since kindy-garten.
You're takin' the job, and that's final.
Heh-heh.
All right.
I probably shouldn'ta quit my old job this mornin', huh?
Rarity!
Fantastic!
I could not be happier, makin' foot-stompin' applesauce the old-fashioned way with my family.
And I'm happy for you and your new job, too.
I'm sure you won't slip up.
Whoa!
You bet your britches, missy!
I wouldn't miss your big night for the world!
Whoa!
Ugh... now, hang on.
I got the sense Rarity's overwhelmed, which is understandable.
I mean, she's all alone here without any of her friends.
Which is why I wouldn'ta taken the job, but that's just me.
Uh, point is, we're here to support Rarity.
What?
Uh, which character is that?
These are her pictures?
Chillin sandy style?
U no how I do?
I came I saw I vintaged?
Okay, somebody tell me why this picture has twenty thousand likes.
Uh, I don't know.
Spendin' all that time just to look good in a picture ain't my idea of fun.
Here comes the lead parade costume designer!
You've been here solo without your best friends all this time.
How can we help?
You know Vignette Valencia?
[gasps]
Hmph.
She sure is, somethin'.
I got a question, too.
When you said she's your best friend at the park, did you mean best friend, comma, at the park?
[sighs]
It's nothin'.
[sighs]
You were born for this, Rarity.
Anythin' I can do to help?
So, uh, wanna take a break and go get a caramel apple?
Of course.
I-I just thought... uh, never mind.
You're right.
I wouldn't wanna rain on your parade.
Uh, Hmmm, Micro Chips?
Uh, Applejack.
You're who they hired to be the caramel apple, girl?
Huh?
Hey, Rarity.
How's?
Whoa.
Uh, have you seen Fluttershy?
See, she went wanderin' off with Vignette and then just disappeared.
Oh, it's not that I don't trust Vignette, if that's what you're thinkin'.
Are you seriously not concerned about Fluttershy?
Well, if you ain't gonna worry about her, I will!
Howdy, y'all!
Sorry.
Have you seen Fluttershy?
Nobody's seen her all afternoon.
Her phone's goin' straight to voicemail.
I keep thinkin' somethin' real bad mighta happened.
Uh, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?
Okay.
Thanks.
Pinkie Pie?
Don't tell me you're workin' for the park now, too.
Geh, uhhh... so, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?
Or maybe I want her to be my prime suspect because she's Rarity's new best friend at the park.
Am I goin' crazy over a whole lot o' nothin'?
I, uh... y-y-you see, it-it's just?
Uh, if you'll just let me explain.
I'm lookin' for my friend, and?
I'm tryin' to tell you my friend made this badge.
It ain't real.
How many times do I have to say it?
[gasps]
Is Vignette zappin' my friends with a magical phone?
I knew she was up to somethin'!
Just wasn't expectin' somethin' so magic and evil.
She makes 'em disappear, but where do they go?
Stop!
Uh, not everybody stop.
I just meant my friends.
Y'all keep doin' what you're doin'.
Sewin' up them, uh, clothes.
Nobody go anywhere with Vignette, understand?
No, Rarity.
Vignette is evil!
She's done somethin' to Fluttershy.
And I saw her from the security office when she made Rainbow Dash disappear with her phone!
Ten eggs in a chicken coop says it's Equestrian magic.
If you're so innocent, then how do you explain this?
Say goodbye to your mannequin thingy!
Uh, hang on.
Watch it, disappear!
Uh, I think I hashgabbed my SnapTag or all in the?
Ugh.
I can't figure out these new, fandangled apps.
Ugh.
I sound just like Granny Smith!
This is bigger than the parade, Rarity!
I know you didn't just say that about your missing friends!
My parade?
This isn't about you!
She's done somethin' to our friends!
You're so blind, you can't even see she's usin' you!
You only like her because she's always blowin' smoke up your chimney!
But that's what she does to everyone!
YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL!
Maybe I should just...
The parade's about to start!
Ugh!
If only I had done somethin' or said somethin' different!
Maybe none of this woulda happened.
[sighs]
I really screwed things up with Rarity.
[gasps]
Rarity!
Uh, Come on, now.
Your talent puts you so far beyond the need for flattery.
And I'm sorry I got jealous.
All this time I thought I was bein' honest with you about not likin' Vignette.
I wasn't bein' honest with myself.
I felt like I was losin' my best friend.
What?
We've been wastin' all this time chin-waggin' about feelin's?
We need to get crackin' on a rescue plan!
Twilight?
Uh, Magic.
Got it.
Uh, none.
Uh, I can rub two sticks together.
Uh, hang on.
I think I can hear you talkin'.
S-Somewhere close.
Really, y'all?
You do realize if we stop the parade, no one will see all your hard work.
Nice one!
Yeah.
She is.
You guess so?
You created virtual holograms of our friends and almost sent an entire crowd of people to squish city!
Make that two.
Hey, maybe the parade ain't ruined after all!
I think I may have forgotten to pack my sea legs.
We couldn't even spend the day at Equestria World without creatin' a calamity.
Hmmmph.
Mmmph!
Mmmmmph!
Mmmm-mmmmmm, mmm-mmmmm!
Mmmmmm!
Mmmmmmmm...
Ugh.
She sure wasn't helpin' me not get sick off the side of the boat.
The good news is now that it's dark, maybe my brain won't know I'm on a boat.
Oh, no.
It heard me.
Blegh!
Hmmph.
Oof.
I'll fix the engine while you're gone.
We'll be ready to go before that storm hits us.
Not worse than losin' Rainbow Dash.
Breaker-breaker four-and-a-half, this is Red Delicious requestin' a storm status update!
Over!
I can't slow it down!
And we just lost steering!
Stand back!
Okay!
Let's shove off!
Two days and nights of cool music, hot food, and sleepin' under the stars!
[chuckles]
We know.
Y'all won't stop talkin' about it.
All right, less laughin' and more gaffin'.
We got an early mornin' tomorrow.
So, I says to Big Mac, Get your own chicken coop!
Hey!
Welp, y'all have fun seein' PostCrush.
We'll see ya back at camp tonight.
Uh, what's wrong?
Uhhh, Get your own chicken coop!
Welp, y'all have fun seein' PostCrush.
We'll see ya back at camp tonight.
So, I says to Big Mac, Get your own chicken coop!
Pinkie Pie's been actin' mighty strange this evening.
Any idea what might've happened to her?
Bad news.
Transmission's shot.
Repairs ain't gonna be cheap.
Tow truck says he'll need cash tomorrow.
That or vocal processing.
Get your own chicken coop!
You two have fun now!
Hey, y'all!
Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider?
Wow, Rarity.
It's a fine job you're doin' there.
'Course it might not get done 'til after the concert.
None taken.
Especially since I wasn't raised in a barn.
My family just happens to have a barn.
Where I was born.
And, spent most of my formative years...
How'd it go with the other Princesses?
They like your idea?
Over here, y'all!
Everypony okay?
So now what?
We can't hide here forever.
And let's be honest, we can't go back.
Look at what they did to the Princesses.
We gotta keep them from Twilight.
Hippos?
We got your back.
What is that?
'Case you forgot, we're on a mission to save Equestria.
Now, you listen here, fella, there ain't?
[chuckles]
I'm, gonna, be, sick!
That's it.
Don't look down now!
Whadaya think, Twilight?
Should we just, ask 'em to take us?
[gasps]
[sighs]
What in the hay is she up to?
Phee-yew!
Quick thinkin', Twilight!
Well, I'll be.
[laughs]
Hippogriffs, here we come!
Hello?
Is anypony home?
Hold on now.
Lemme get this straight.
When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled?
Wa-wa-whoa!
[laughs]
You're on!
So that's it?
We left home for nothin'?
We've gotta get back to our families.
Pinkie, we just don't have time for?
What were you thinkin'?
I mean, stealin' their pearl?
[sighs]
Ya think, maybe it's time we talk to Twilight?
And we got no way to defeat those monsters.
Now don't get too excited.
He's just talkin' about us.
Pinkie, quit lookin' so happy!
Ya ain't foolin' nopony!
Uh-oh.
Whoa!
Yee-haw!
[laughs]
All right!
Hey, y'all!
What's everypony?
Ohhh.
Traditional holiday meltdown?
Hey, Twilight.
How's your day?
Stop!
Take a breath.
Now let it out sloooooooooowwww...
Now, I think I have an idea that might help.
What if we change up how we give gifts this year and do a Hearthswarmin' Helper?
Whenever the whole Apple family got together, there were just so many of us, it didn't make sense to buy everypony gifts.
So we'd put our names in a hat, then we'd pull a name, but keep it a secret.
Instead of buyin' everypony a present, you just get one for the pony you picked from the hat.
We just need to put everypony's name in this here hat.
Y'all ready?
No peekin'.
That's perfect!
Pinkie and I can spend the evenin' with y'all and the next mornin' with our families!
If you can figure out who has the pony you want and they're okay with tradin', I guess it's fine.
I don't have Rarity.
Uh-huh.
There you are!
I need your help.
What?
I just need help figurin' out what to get Spike.
Hopefully, anydragon, too.
Wanna split up?
Meet back here in an hour?
I've narrowed down my choices for Spike to fire-dancing sticks, or a Power Ponies comic.
Unenchanted, I think.
Aah!
What is that?
Egh.
Why'd you think that was a good gift for Rainbow Dash?
Short supply, huh?
How much did that set you back?
Somethin' about this here doll seems fishy.
And I ain't just talkin' about the smell of that plastic.
Where'd you get it?
Flim and Flam!
What are those two Hearth's Warmin' hooligans up to now?

What are y'all doin' with these dolls and that ridiculous getup?
Don't you have a resort to run?
It ain't no excuse for sellin' cheap dolls to ponies.

Convincin' ponies to buy that doll ain't in the holiday spirit!
Huh.
But maybe we can show 'em!
Same as everypony else.
I want a Hearth's Warmer.
In fact, I want three!
After I saw my friend here with hers, I knew I had to buy some for my granny, my brother, and my little sister!
But, Fluttershy, this is the must-have gift of the season.
That's true!
I guess I need to put more thought into getting the right gift for each pony.
Can I return these?
Oh, uh, you want 'em?
I'm gonna go pick out gifts that are just as special as the ponies they're for.
[sighs]
The sweet sounds of the season.
Puttin' those two in their places makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
It probably ain't what they're expectin', but we still got these.
Yay.
Yeeeeeah...
How are we gonna get rid of this thing?
Pops said sometimes the hat chooses the pony when he gave me this.
Hopefully my gift inspired whoever's wearin' it to be the best farmer ever.
We got a bit distracted with Flim and Flam's shenanigans.
I guess Hearthswarming Helper was kind of a disaster.
Triple Pony Dare.
I bet Rainbow Dash she couldn't wait patiently in this line all the way to the end.
Told ya so!
I win, fair and square.
I missed you so much, Tallulah!
Triple Pony Dare ya, Rainbow Dash!
Fly slower than apple molasses!
Whoa...
You gotta dig five holes before sunset, Earth pony style!
It should be me!
If Rainbow Dash didn't keep comin' up with such lowdown, nasty Dares.
No way!
Sorry.
Can't see a darn thing.
The way I see it, we gallop backwards, whistle carols, then lick 'em.
Sorry for the inconvenience!
Oh, hey!
What do you think?
Twilight said I could do the announcements today.
With all the bad news, I thought I'd give 'em some flavor.
[chuckles]
Sure were.
Want to hear another?
This land shall be known as Unicornia, proclaimed Princess Platinum.
PEGASOPOLIS!, demanded Commander Hurricane.
Dirtville!, suggested Chancellor Puddinghead.
And still the windigos raged outside.
That, is the fifth strangest thing I've ever seen.
Uh-oh!
Whoooaaa!
Hey, Fluttershy!
Congrats on bein' Teacher of the Month.
Again.
What is this, number fifteen?
Wow.
You really are a great teacher.
Welcome to the first annual Student Appreciation School Party!
Thanks for your help, Fluttershy.
We wouldn've never thought of this without you.
Uh, yup.
Howdy.
Y'all are both still late!
We gotta shove off soon, or we'll miss the tailwind.
Too much to talk about right now.
Let 'er loose, Spike!
Hmm.
The basket's too heavy.
Sorry to do this, Twilight, but... they'll keep 'til we get back.
Ugh.
You're gonna be like this the whole trip, ain't ya?
[sighs]
nd try our famous rainbow trout catch-and-release activity.
Huh.
Now that sounds right up my river.
Huh.
I thought so, too.
Maybe we should've turned left at that last cloud instead o' right.
Tell that to the rainbow.
We're gonna craaaaash!
Phew!
Thanks, y'all.
That basket could've been us.
Huh.
Funny.
You'd think a big luxury resort would be sorta, well... easier to spot.
Excuse me?
Could you, uh, give us directions?
Howdy.
Hard to tell in this light, but she looked a little gray, didn't she?
Yeah.
As long as we have beds to sleep in, we're set.
Whoa!
Ugh.
Maybe they recognize Rainbow Dash.
Except the stuff that's grayer.
We can ask the mayor.
Well, look at that.
Somepony's fixin' up our balloon.
Petunia Petals let us in.
I'm almost afraid to ask, but the brochure mentioned fishin'?
'Cept for all the cracks.
No Rainbow Festival?
Balloon's not fixed yet.
Heh.
Nothin' we like better than a challenge, 'specially when it comes to helpin' ponies.
Any tools I can borrow, your Honor?
I'm gonna spruce up that billboard to let everypony know this here Rainbow Festival's back in business!
Hmm.
I think some o' this can be saved, but we'll need some fresh lumber.
Uh, Torque, the mayor said maybe you could lend a hoof.
Well, for one thing, we're helpin' the mayor.
And for another, Granny Smith always says, You break somethin', you fix it.
And any job you do, you should be proud of.
Well, absolutely!
It's a pretty rare talent to have.
Nice work on that balloon basket, by the way.
Reweavin' all that straw is no joke.

From what I've seen of the mayor, how can ya tell exactly when peculiar kicks in?
Hoo-wee!
This looks amazin', Torque.
Nopony else could have pulled this off.
Whoa!
D-Did y'all see that?
Uh, Twilight, I think I saw?
Yeah, but?
Okay.
Huh!
Well, look at that!
Hmm... Twilight!
I really think you should see this.
You betcha?
[sighs]
That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya!
It is comin' back!
Heh.
I got all kinds o' Elements right here under my hat.
I'll let you see 'em for five bits.
I know where the Elements are.
This, uh, here boulder just told me.
I swear.
Uh, A, uh, a bugbear in, plaid socks flew down and, uh, g-grabbed them!
Then disappeared!
Huh.
Craziest thing I ever did see!
They're at a secret party up in that there tree.
Run by a, squirrel named, uh, Jerome.
But, uh, y-you need a password to get in.
The party password is rutabaga.
Who's breakin' what now?
Who are you?
Starlight?
How 'bout that?
Y'all better come with me.
It's, uh, dangerous out here.
Uh... stolen!
Uh, I barely got away!
Follow me, and I'll tell ya all about it.
So there I was.
Just me and, uh, a bucket of honey.
Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket.
Uh, b-but I-I survived all by myself in this here forest for, uh, a hundred and... twenty-seven hours!
Well, I sure don't need any o' that silly stuff you're luggin' around.
[chuckles]
Just look in a mirror.
Guess I should've told you that before, huh?
Now, wait a second.
Weren't you just?

Badger installation art!
Ya see?
Aunt Orange!
Uncle Orange!
Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!
Oh, it's simply divine.
Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to.
Where I'm from, nights are so quiet, you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you.
What's he talking about?
What do I say?
I don't wanna look like a fool.
Thank goodness.
Being a city pony's hard work.
Cock-a-doodle-doo...
Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big McIntosh are up to.
I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...
[sighs]
All I'm sayin' is that you may have plenty of brawn, but I'm the one with the ideas on how to run things better around here!
Too many!
Oh, hey there, Filthy Rich!
Like what?
That is an interesting idea.
Ya know what?
How 'bout we give you three barrels of cider early, and if it sells well, we'll make a deal for the rest?
Hoo-wee!
I tell ya, if the future means me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres and you bein' quiet, I can't wait!
Aw, Granny will love the idea.
And then she'll decide that I'm the one who should take over the farm.
You'll see.
Actually, more of an opportunity.
Y'see, we ran into Filthy Rich in town.
Did ya know he's runnin' the family store now?
Well, uh, since cider season is almost here, he?
or, I-I mean, I?
thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of cider to sell at the store before the season starts.


But, Granny, why can't we sell a few barrels o' cider early to Filthy Rich?
And how is it any different than when you gave zap apple jam to Filthy's grandpappy to sell?
I get what you're sayin', Granny.
But couldn't you make an exception just this once?
I sort of promised.
[sighs]
You an' I both know you don't hate to say anythin'.
And you don't ever have to listen to anypony else.
Exactly.
Uh, about the cider, Rich... the thing is, I-I don't think I can get you any.
Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, what with all the blight.
Uh, sick!
Uh, what Big Mac means is, uh, we've been tryin' to keep it quiet.
Don't want people to make rash decisions about doin' business with Sweet Apple Acres just because we're, uh, a little short-hooved at the moment.
Much appreciated.
But right now, we-we only ask for your understandin' during this difficult time.
W-W-What was I supposed to do?
You heard Rich.
If I told him the truth, he was gonna stop doin' business with us altogether.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
Uh, excuse me one second!
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.
I-I didn't see ya there.
Can you go out to the barn?
I, uh, I think I might've left a blight sprayer in the orchard.
I know, but, uh, if we forgot a sprayer, I'd wanna get it before dark.
You go start countin', a?
and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back, okay?
Oh, well, you know how Big Mac can get to... to talkin', especially when he's upset.
And right now, he's just as worried about Granny Smith as I am.
Well, one thing's for sure, she... she shouldn't be seein' anypony right now.
In fact, I'm gettin' more upset just thinkin' about it.
Excuse me.
Sorry, Granny.
I just decided if I helped you, it would go faster.
Oh, good.
Uh, say, Granny, when did you first fight the apple blight again?
Uh, Big Mac didn't wanna be rude, but you just can't see Granny right now, because she's... got apple blight!
Yeah, that's usually the case.
The doctors think it's from workin' in the orchards for so many years.
Y'see, we had to take Granny to Ponyville General.
We just got back right before you showed up.
Um, I'm sure you'll be fine, but you should leave, just in case.
That's right.
Wait.
Get where?
I got it!
I'd love to hear more, Granny, but we gotta get to the hospital right away!
What he means is you're needed at the hospital.
It's the apple blight!
It's startin' to infect ponies now!
The doctors need an expert opinion, and nopony knows more about fightin' blight than Granny Smith!
[gasps]
You know, we're supposed to go in, uh, in the back!
Uh, to avoid anypony in the waitin' room with the blight.
Oops!
I almost forgot!
This is perfect!
Now you don't have to worry about catchin' the blight.
Now you wait right here while I, uh... check on your presentation!
Fancy meetin' you two here!
Granny's room.
Sure!
Just go down here, take a left, then a right, go down some stairs, up a bunch more stairs, uh, through the cafeteria, left three more times, and then you're there!
Easy as Granny's apple pie!
Uh, I'll catch up!
I gotta find Big Mac!
Okay, Granny, just wait here one second and we can go.
Big Mac can't come!
He, uh, might be contagious!
All right, climb up here and I'll cover you up.
Then I'll bring Rich in, tell him you're Granny, but you're not allowed to take the sheets off.
You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over.
Big McIntosh, please just listen to me for once!
This ain't about my ideas.
If Rich finds out about all the lies, he'll cut off ties with us and the farm'll go under!
Now do you want that to happen, or do you wanna help?
I would, but if I let you do the talkin', you'd just ramble on and on until we all got caught!
Just lay down, keep still, and promise me you won't say anythin' for once in your life!
Granny!
Granny!
Uh, Granny, they need you to wait here!
I'll come get ya!
Well, you're in luck, 'cause it's-it's right over here, and this time I'll make sure you don't get lost.
What in the dadgum?
I mean, she was right here!
Oh, no.
We gotta go!
You two, don't lose that gurney!
Granny, what are you doin'?
You were supposed to stay there!
Uh... well, okay, come with me, but be quiet!
You know, save your voice for the big presentation!
[gasps]
But-but-but-but that's my brother on there!

Everypony, just stop!
This is all a big misunderstandin'!

Actually, it's a big lie.
[sighs]
I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it.
Those were all lies.
A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm.
So I just kept tellin' more.
Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did!
This whole thing is my fault.
[sighs]
Thanks, big brother.
And whether it's me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres or you, I know it'll be in good hooves.
Sorry, Granny!
I got to check my traps, or the Great Seedlin' might get away!
Now, where'd I put that trap?
[gasps]
Whoa!
