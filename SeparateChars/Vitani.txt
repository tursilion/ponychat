At Pride Rock.
We saw everything!
Simba's new cub is a girl!
Ssshhh.
Scar.
Scar's dead... genius.
Nuka!
Where's Kovu?
Did you leave him out there on his own again?
Mother's gonna be mad.
She told you to watch him!
Yeah right.
Why don't you tell that to her?
Oh yeah?
Here's your chance.
Hey, Kovu.
You wanna... fight?
One day when you're big and strong
Testify!
Mmmh.
Gee.
That's it!
Now come on... Kiara has started her hunt.
We have to move quickly.
Come on!
Get him!
What are you waiting for?
Kovu, get him!
Affirmative.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Nuka...
Where's your pretty daughter, Nala?
No, Mother!
Kiara's right.
Enough.
