Well, uh, that is kinda what our teacher said in history class.
But... But, hey, oh, we can play the game your way if you want, Sunny.
I don't mind.
Take that, Earth pony!
Pew-pew!
How does that feel?
Pew-pew!
Oh, no!
My brains are melting!
Aha!
There you are, Sunny.
Just the pony I was expecting.
What is it with me and critters?
I'm like a magnet to them.
Guys, come on.
Give Hitch a little space.
Oh, please.
Like you don't know.
Today is the annual presentation at Canterlogic.
Uh, no, you're not.
Listen, I know that you have come up with some harebrained scheme to sabotage it, and if you think I'm just gonna let you walk in there...
Morning, Mayflower, Dahlia.
Sunny, I'm on duty.
Okay?
Hey!
W-Wait up!
I'm not finished!
Sunny!
Sunny, we both know how this goes.
Every year you try to sneak in, and every year I stop you.
I'm asking you as your friend, Sunny, not as sheriff.
Just please try not to pull any stunts today.
Thank you.
Now, give your delivery to Sprout and go home.
Hey, hey!
That's a violation of Code 33!
You know what, Sprout?
I think I finally got through to Sunny.
Yikes.
That's gonna be a lot of paperwork.
Sunny.
Shut her down!
Sheriff's orders!
All right, Sunny.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Show's over, Sunny.
Do you have any idea how many bylaws you broke in there?
Actually, for once I can't!
Because there's so many!
I tried to warn you.
I can't keep associating with some pony who breaks every rule and causes chaos wherever she goes.
I'm the sheriff!
The law is the law, Sunny, and I'm here to uphold it and keep everypony safe.
Come on, Sunny, what did you think was gonna happen?
You give a little speech and what?
Everypony just magically welcomes unicorns and Pegasi into Maretime Bay?
You keep saying there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, then, prove it.
All of that pony unity stuff was just a foal's bedtime story made up by your dad.
Like it or not, this is the way it is and always will be.
I'm the last real friend you got in this town.
You really want to lose me, too?
Hey, what's going on?
Unicorn attaaaaaaaack!
This is not a drill!
I repeat – this is not! A! Drill!
A vulnerable young pony!
Gotcha!
Your son is safe now, ma'am.
You're welcome!
Man the Splat-a-pult!
Activate the unicorn trap!
Pick up that litter!
All right, citizens, calm down.
The threat has been neutralized.
The unicorn has been captured.
You may now cheer.
Sunny!
What are you doing?
Don't even think about it.
No, don't you dare.
No, no, no, no!
Sunny!
Deputy, to the lighthouse!
You gotta be kidding me...
Sunny Starscout!
Argh, that hurt.
Sunny Starscout, I know you're in there with that unicorn!
Come out with your hooves up and surrender!
Will you let me do my job?
You are under arrest!
W-What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We have reinforcements?
Huh?
Oh, come on!
I told her.
I told her.
No more favors.
No more bailing her out.
She gave me no choice.
No choice!
All right.
We need to arrest her and bring her back to face the full force of the law.
You and I.
You know what?
I think you're right.
This one's a job for Hitch and Hitch only.
All right.
Sprout, you stay here while I'm out dancing with danger.
Keep everypony calm, maintain the peace, be a pillar of strength.
Who am I kidding?
Just try not to start a way while I'm gone, okay?
Huh?
Litter!
I mean, a clue.
Hmmm... Unicorn hair.
Pegasi.
Track's gone cold.
Sunny, Sunny, Sunny, Sunny.
You think you've escaped?
Well, think again.
I will not eat!
I will not sleep!
Well, maybe a quick nap and snack if I can't find you in the next few hours, BUT! After that, nothing will stop me!
Thank you.
Thank you.
No, no, you're too kind.
I'll follow you wherever you go!
Whether harshest deserts, the coldest tundras, no trail too dangerous, no clue too small!
The past matters not!
What?
What?
Gotcha.
Sunny Starscout, you are under arrest—!
Huh?
Huh?
Freeze!
Okay.
I think we lost 'em.
Arresting you. And saving you. So, you know, a little of both actually.
You're welcome!
And you are?
Wait a minute.
So that means... you're a princess?
What?
Anypony care to explain?
What?
Wait!
You can't just... But I'm a sheriff!
What am I even doing here?
Hoofing it across daisy fields, looking for a magical crystal that doesn't even exist!
No, it is not.
Did I just agree with a Pegasus?
Let's get one thing straight.
After this whole escapade is over with, you are gonna march back home to Maretime Bay with me.
Is that clear?
Great.
No, no, no, no, no!
Where's my badge?
Hey!
You!
I know unicorns like shiny things!
What?
Hours?
Oh, well.
That's the end of that.
Time to go home.
I wish I could say it was nice meeting all of you, but it wasn't.
Come on, Sunny.
Ah, great.
Come on, stupid stick.
Thank you.
I've got it.
Hah!
Are you sure about all this?
By giving magic back to our enemies?
Uh, let me think.
I know – a lot!
I don't know.
Maybe I should just go back to Maretime Bay where I'm needed.
Ugh.
Can I ask you a question?
Why did you come to Maretime Bay?
Hey, um... I want to do my part.
What have we got to lose, right?
I have to admit.
A unicorn forest does sound kind of magical.
Or not.
This is a new low.
It's never gonna work!
If you say so.
Oops!
Well, this is... cheerful.
How can we tell which ones are magic?
Huh?
Forbidden words?
I know, I know.
No forbidden words.
Yes!
She's doin' it, she's doin' it!
Uh... Magic! Wing! Feather! MAYONNAISE!
Aah! My badge!
Yes!
Sunny.
It's okay.
You did everything you could.
I guess this is goodbye... friends.
I'm right here if you need to talk, Sunny.
Sunny!
Huh?
Hey, w-wait.
What is going on here?
Official Sprout what?
Sprout!
What are you doing?
Ugh.
Wait, wait, no, Sprout, listen to me.
Listen to me.
The Pegasi and unicorns can be our friends.
There's no need to be afraid of them.
Besides, they don't even have any magic.
What?
I've gotta rein that thing in!
Sprout!
Stop!
This... ends... now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
Okay, that was a bad idea!
No, no, no!
What?
Wow!
You did it, Sunny.
That's better.
All roasty and toasty.
I'll just keep you safe here until we can find who you belong to, okay?
Nopony!
Nopony at all!
How can I help you, Posey?
Okay.
The complaint box is over there on the wall.
Whose fault?
Whaaaaaat?
Sunny, there's no need to get all huffy about it.
Izzy was just trying to stand up for Pipp.
Ugh!
I didn't call you huffy!
I said you were being huffy!
There's a difference, and-- Whoa.
And unicorns to drop stuff onto sandcastles!
Hey, hey, heeeey!
I do not like this!
Did I just... understand you?
Cool it, McSnipsalot.
And I'm gonna teach this little fella how to build a shelf!
You know, I'm actually pretty hoovesy.
Ooh, whoops.
McSnips-a-lot!
I can't get it straight!
I'm in way over my head!
Leave it, McSnips-a-lot!
Whoo-hoo!
Are those Pegasi crying?
Huh... Hah!
Whoa!
Uh... Whoa!
Well, it sounds to me like you just need to be honest with Izzy.
As a pony of the law, I can tell you – honesty is always the best policy.
Hold on one second.
Of course, sometimes a thoughtful gift can work wonders.
Get ready for the ultimate Maretime Bay tour!
I thought all the unicorn traps were disabled.
Note to self – check traps for
The release button isn't working!
But I planned the tour with stops I knew each of you would love.
Izzy can't do a tour in a box.
This is ridiculous.
You can't even see!
Tour's cancelled!
Okay, fine.
Right this way!
Our tour begins with the Maretime Bay town square!
Hey!
Huh?
Last stop... The beach.
I thought you'd love this, Izzy.
That is it!
We have to get Izzy out of there now!
Will nothing open this adorable cube prison?
You have got to be kidding me.
My perfect tour... ruined!
This tour was supposed to show you that Maretime Bay is an amazing place to live.
So... you all like Maretime Bay?
Outside the box!
Aha!
Right this way, and you'll see
UGHHHH!
Whoo!
Hitch has got it!
Uh-huh!
Me, too!
We're not lost!
We're just slowing down!
Living life unplugged!
What seems to be the problem, neighbor?
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Not now, bunnycorns.
The only thing I'm hungry for... is justice!
Huh?
Sheriff's station.
You got Hitch.
What?
Hang on, Sunny.
This is Hitch.
What's gone?
Are you there?
Hitch here!
Yikes!
Be right with you!
Hello?
Hello?
I've got this under control, Zipp.
Aah!
Anyway, I work alone!
There's only one perfectly groomed sheriff capable of handling it all – me!
Crime waits for nopony!
Hitch knew this was the work of a genius criminal mastermind.
But somehow, some way, he would connect the dots.
Uh, strings.
I'd arrest somepony for a super-citrus smoothie right now.
Whoa.
That's convenient.
I don't remember picking this up.
Straaaaange.
Delicious, but straaaaange.
Look out, crime!
Hitch is comin' for ya!
Smoothie cups?
Sunglasses?
The missing painting?
Am I the criminal mastermind?
I'm all washed up, Zipp.
Here.
Take the keys.
Find a new sheriff.
Something caused Hitch to snap.
He had gone down a dark road.
Uh, you might be onto something.
Um, Zipp?
A little help?
You're right, Zipp.
Maybe I do need a new deputy.
You had me running all over town.
But now I finally got you.
What do you have to say for yourselves?
Wait.
Did you steal those things for me?
Well, I'm flattered, but you can't go around taking things.
You've broken a dozen laws, not to mention health code violations.
Go return everything!
I'm sorry for ignoring you.
But you did the crime, and now you gotta do the time.
Anypony think Izzy is acting a bit strange?
We'll do better.
I promise.
They're doing it again with the garden tools!
There's no time!
Sunny, w-we're... We're so sorry!
Sunny?
SUNNY!
Agree to disagree.
