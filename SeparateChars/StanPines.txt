Good morning, knuckleheads.
You two know what day it is?
For tonight's final illusion, we have the incredible Sack of Mystery.
When you put your money in, it mysteriously disappears!
Wendy!
Uh, how about these crystals?
Alright, alright!
Party supplies are now off-limits.
That's debatable.
Aw, come on, what's with all this traffic?
And why is it all, covered wagons?
Oh no!
Not today!
Not today!
There she is, Mabel... the cheapest fair money can rent.
I spared every expense.
Welcome to a world of mystery!
Here we are, the Summerween Superstore!
In this land of ours, there are many great pits.
But none more bottomless than the bottomless pit.
Which as you can see here is bottomless.
I'm gonna throw this pig out of the house!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Continuing our Mystery Tour you'll see the world famous Outhouse of Mystery!
I got stuck in there once!
Kids!
Come quick!
Mabel, quit being creepy!
The news is finally on.
Thirty long years and it's all led up to this.
My greatest achievement!
Probably should've worn pants.
Feisty, I like it.
If I finally pull this off, it'll all have been worth it.
I just have to keep playing it cool... if anyone ever finds out about this...
Yeah, right.
I've come this far.
Who could possibly catch me now?
Hey, easy with that, it's genuine plastic!
And repave the cracks in the parking lot while you're at it!
I don't want my car falling into China!
Who wants Stan-cakes?
They're like pancakes, but they probably have some of my hair in 'em.
Not even gonna ask.
Night, Soos.
Well, hello there, traveler.
I see your car broke down on this lonesome country road.
A place so remote, that NO ONE CAN HEAR YOUR SCREAMS!
Hey, what about work?
Kids!
Why is Soos eating his own pants?
Soos!
I need to scratch myself in two places at once!
Putting a rainbow wig on a big white gorilla.
Heh.
Yeah.
It's nice to finally have a day where nothing interesting happens whatsoever.
Alright, Santiago.
You have 24 hours to get these pugs across the U.
border.
Nice.
And don't forget bug spray!
It's perfect for spraying in the face of hitchhikers.
Yeah, something terrible!
Ahahahaha!
Hahaha!
It was worth it.
Ladies and gentlemen, behold!
The Sascrotch!
No touching the merchandise!
Oh, not good.
All right, all right, look alive, people.
I need someone to go hammer up these signs in the spooky part of the forest.
Nobody asked you, Soos.
Wendy, I need you to put up this sign!
I'd fire all of you if I could.
All right, let's make it, eenie, meenie, miney, you.
Ugh, this again.
That says BEWARB.
Look, kid.
The whole monsters in the forest thing is just local legend, drummed up by guys like me to sell merch to guys like that.
So quit being so paranoid!
What'cha reading there, slick?
That's a good issue.
How's it hanging?
Somebody say crombie?
What is that, crombie?
That's not even a word.
You're losing your mind.
Soos!
The portable toilets are clogged again!
And here we have Rock that looks like a face rock: the rock that looks like a face.
No, it looks like a face.
It's a rock that looks like a face!
For the fifth time!
It's, it's not an actual face!
Behold!
The world's most distracting object.
Just try to look away, you can't!
I can't even remember what I was talking about.
Yeesh.
You two get hit by a bus or something?
Ahah!
Uh, hey!
W-wouldn't you know it?
Um, I accidentally overstocked some inventory, so, uh...
how's about each of you take one item from the gift shop?
On the house, y'know?
The catch is do it before I change my mind, now take something.
Wouldn't she rather have, like, a doll, or something?
Fair enough!
It's Family Fun Day, genius!
We're cuttin' off work and having one of those, you know, bonding-type deals.
You call that Ben Franklin?
He looks like a woman!
Uh-oh.
All right, maybe I haven't been the best summer caretaker.
But I swear, today we're gonna have some real family fun.
Now who wants to put on some blindfolds and get into my car?
Ha ha.
Nah, but with these cataracts I might as well be.
What is that, a woodpecker?
Okay, okay.
Open 'em up!
Ta-da!
It's fishin' season!
You're gonna love it!
The whole town's out here!
That's some quality family bonding!
Come on, this is gonna be great!
I've never had fishing buddies before.
The guys from the lodge won't go with me: they don't like or trust me.
Hey, I know what'll cheer you sad sacks up.
Pow!
Pines family fishing hats!
That, that's hand stitching, you know.
It's just gonna be you, me, and those goofy hats on a boat for ten hours!
I brought the joke book!
Well, that happened.
Now let's untie this boat and get out on that lake!
All right, all right, let's think this through.
Ya kids could go waste your time on some epic monster-finding adventure, or you could spend the day learning how to tie knots and skewer worms with your Great Uncle Stan!
So, whaddaya say?
Ingrates!
Aw, who needs 'em?
I got a whole box of creepy fishing lures to keep me company.
Traitors!
Ah, I'll find my own fishing buddies!
There's my new pals!
Hey!
Wanna hear a joke?
Here goes.
My ex-wife still misses me, but her aim is gettin' better!
Her aim is gettin' better!
Y'see, it's, it's funny because marriage is terrible.
Look, when you're threadin' the line, lot of people don't know this, but you wanna use a barrel knot.
That's a secret from one fishing buddy to another!
Heh heh.
Just call me your GRUNKLE STAN!
Ha ha, you see, the thing about that is...
Er, ugh, gah!
Mollycoddling...
Aw, come on!
Boo!
Boo!
Yeah, well, I, I...
What the, Kids?
I thought you two were off playing Spin the Bottle with Soos!
Save your sympathy!
I've been having a great time withoutcha'!
Makin' friends, talkin' to my reflection, I had a run-in with the lake police!
Guess I gotta wear this ankle bracelet now, so that'll be fun.
You knuckleheads ever seen me thread a hook with my eyes closed?
You're on!
I like those odds!
What happened to your shirt?
It's just me, your Grunkle Stan!
Behold the Gravity Falls Wax Museum!
It was one of our most popular attractions, before I forgot all about it.
I got 'em all!
Genghis Khan, Sherlock Holmes, some kind of, I don't know, goblin man?
And now for my personal favorite: Wax Abraham Lincoln, right over, Oh!
Oh no!
Come on, who left the blinds open?
Wax John Wilkes Booth, I'm looking in your direction!
How do you fix a wax figure?
You really think you can make one of these puppies?
I like your gumption, kid!
Kids, have you seen my pants?
Why's your sister talking to the ceiling?
I found my pants but now I'm missing my... Ahhh!
I think, the Wax Museum's back in business!
You all know me, folks!
Town darling, Mr Mystery.
Please, ladies, control yourselves!
As you know, I always bring the people of this fair town novelties and befuddlements, the likes of which the world, has never known.
But enough about me.
Behold...
And now a word from our own Mabelangelo!
Your microphone's a turkey baster, Toby.
Next question.
That was a typo.
Good night, everyone!
Hot pumpkin pie!
Look at all this cash!
And I owe it all to one person, this guy!
Ooh!
Yeah, you too, ya little gremlin.
Now you kids wash up.
We got another long day of fleecing rubes tomorrow.
Go, go!
Kids.
Stupid duck!
Well, I'm gonna use the john.
You need anything?
I love this guy!
Don't you go nowhere.
No, No, Noooooo!
Wax Stan!
He's been, m-murdered!
I got up to use the john, right?
And when I come back, blammo!
He's headless!
You take that back, Sheriff Blubs!
Yeah, yeah!
Let the boy help.
He's got a little brain up in his head.
Hey, give me a hand with this coffin, will ya?
I'm doin' a memorial service for wax Stan.
Something small, but classy.
Hm, seems like the kind of thing that responsible parents wouldn't want you to do...
Good thing I'm an uncle.
Avenge me kids!
AVENGE MEEE!
Kids, Soos, lifeless wax figures, thank you all for coming.
Some people might say it's wrong for a man to love a wax replica of himself.
Easy Soos.
Wax Stan, I hope you're picking pockets in wax heaven.
I'm sorry, I got glitter in my eye!
Twenty dollars?
I'll just take 'em when you're not lookin'.
I said I was gonna rob you.
Hot Belgian waffles!
What happened to my parlor!
Ha ha!
You kids and your imaginations!
My head!
Ha ha!
I missed this guy!
You done good kids!
Alright, line up for some affectionate noogie-ing.
They got scalded!
Well, don't get too curiousy.
Ever since that monster Gideon rolled into town, I've had nothin' but trouble.
Gideon!
Never!
You're forbidden from patronizing the competition.
No one that lives under my roof is allowed under that Gideon's roof!
Somebody answer that door!
Who's at the door?
Hey, hey!
What the jackal is Mabel doing in the paper next to that crazy pickpocket Gideon?
WHAT?
That little shyster is dating my great niece!
Yeah, well it ends tonight.
I'm going right down to that little skunk's house... this is gonna stop RIGHT now!
Gideon, you little punk!
Open up!
I will pardon NOTHING!
Out of the way Bud, I'm looking for Gideon!
But, but I came, Wow...
I went to jail there once.
Some digs you got here.
Oh, this.
This is beautiful.
Uh, yeah, and I'm against it.
Nyah.
I'm listening.
Great news, Mabel.
You have to marry Gideon!
It's all part of my long term deal with Buddy Gleeful.
There's a lot of cash tied up in this thing.
Plus I got this shirt.
Ugh, I am fat.
Bodies change, honey! Bodies change...
Ah, this is livin', brother.
Rebuke?
Is that a word?
What, you got like a word-a-day calendar or something?
Okay, okay.
I can see when I'm not wanted.
TRY AND CATCH ME, SUCKERS!
I coulda had it all.
What the heck happened to you two?
Gideon.
Yeah, the little mutant swore vengeance on the whole family.
Ha, I guess he's gonna try to nibble my ankles or somethin'.
Uh oh.
He's plannin' on destruction right now!
You're all fired.
I'm headin' out.
You two are gonna wash the bathrooms, right?
Ha ha!
You stay out of trouble!
Kids!
I can't find the remote and I refuse to stand up!
NOOOO!
Yes!
Yes!
In your face Elizabeth!
It's just like my life! ...in a way.
Ah, the wedding.
I've waited so long for this.
Oh, look at her in that dress!
What's he doin' here?
You had your chance at the cotillion, you!
That's what I'm SAYING!
UuuaaaAAAAGGGHHH!
Uh, couldn't find the remote.
What are you, a cop?
Yeah, sure.
Soon as this yahoo makes up his mind.
I'm fine locking him inside if you are.
Lazy Susan!
There's my little ray of sunshine!
Where were you yesterday?
Ha ha ha ha!
Hilarious!
You do split plates, right?
Great!
We'll all split a one-fourth of the number seven, plus a free salad dressing for the lady, and a small plate of ketchup for the boy.
With the fancy flour they use these days?
What am I, made of money?
Manliness Tester?
He says he's, he says he, HA HA HA HA HA HA!
Look, face the music, kid.
You got no muscles, you smell like baby wipes, and let's not forget last Tuesday's, incident.
So smooth!
My eyes!
Quit stallin'!
Yeesh!
How am I related to that?
Nothing in here but a cold, dark, empty soul.
Thanks there, sugar pot.
I-I mean, I mean uh honey wasp, kitten baby, b-baby cow.
Nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Talk about what?
Why is this table wet?
Stop it!
Oh boy.
Keep it down, will ya?
Alright.
I admit it, okay?
It would be nice if she liked me.
But I've been out of the game for so long I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, look at her.
She's so classy.
Can I borrow some money?
EHHH, AGGHHH, AGGGHHH, WEEAAGGHH...
Can I scratch myself now?
I don't know how to answer that.
With pleasure!
So, Lazy Susan, what do you say?
Uhhhh, Really?
Mabel!
Let a man enjoy his pie, huh?
Here we go.
You were your own man and you stood up for yourself.
Pituitor?
Don't worry, kid, if you're anything like me, there's more where that came from.
Oh, not again!
How do I get out of this?
The episode begins with Soos and Wendy preparing for a party.
Mabel and Dipper are sitting on a couch.
Nobody's.
Thought this party might be a good way to get kids to spend money at the Shack.
The young people of this town want fun, I'll smother 'em with fun!
Hey, hey!
Hows about you make yourself useful and copy these flyers?
Save the trouble.
You know the old copier in my office?
I finally fixed the old girl up!
Good as new!
Alright party people, and Dipper.
Let's talk business.
Soos, because you'll work for free, and you begged, I'm lettin' you be DJ.
Not encouraging.
Wendy, you and Mabel will work at the ticket stand.
You realize that if you do, you gotta commit to stay in at the ticket stand with Wendy.
No getting out of it, just the two of you, alone, all night.
Yadda dee, yada doo, yada doo.
Can your uncle throw a party or what?
And if anyone wants to leave, I'm charging an exit fee of 15 bucks!
Hey!
What are you doing, kid?
These suckers aren't gonna rip themselves off!
You promised, remember?
Right, like I'm gonna fall for that.
GIVE ME THAT, MONEY, MONEY!
Hahaha!
We gotta get outta here.
Before it's too late!
They've circled the wagons!
We're trapped!
Nooooooooo!
Ah, boy.
It's Pioneer Day.
Every year these yahoos dress up like idiots to celebrate the day Gravity Falls was founded.
I will break you, little man!
No, thank you!
Just remember if you come back to the Shack talking like these people, you're dead to me.
Dead to me!
Hey there, uh, donkey boy!
Give me a hand with my car, huh?
Ah, c'mon, Steve, you're a mechanic for Pete's sake!
Cut me some slack.
I can't take this anymore!
I'm getting dumber every second I'm here!
Oh, look.
The Constable.
What are you gonna do?
Throw me in ye stocks?
Aw, c'mon!
Hey, nice outfit, Gideon.
You actually look less girly than usual.
Ugh!
PIONEER DAY!
C'mon!
C'mon, ugh!
Yeah, yeah.
What d' ya want, money?
Oh sure, you want that in writing?
There you go.
I did that with my mouth!
Aw, come on!
And then Soos came by and talked to me for like, an hour.
So what's with the top hat?
Pardon me?
You a never gonna make sense, are you, kid?
Ha ha, this guy.
Alright, alright.
I've got a job for you two.
I printed up a bunch of fake safety inspection certificates.
Go slap one on anything that looks like a lawsuit.
When there's no cops around, anything's legal!
Soos, how's that dunk tank coming along?
Ha, you've got it rigged from here to Timbuktu!
There's nothing on Earth that could knock me down!
Hey, you haven't seen my red screwdriver, have ya?
Darn thing went missing.
You've been spending too much time with those kids.
Alright, let's see where'd I put that thing.
It's 12 o' clock!
The Dunk Tank is now open!
Step right up, and dunk me folks!
I'm talking to you, Cut-offs!
That's right!
Muffin-Top, High-Pants!
Who wants a piece of me?
Ahahahaha!
Come back anytime, folks!
Ahahahaha!
It's 12 o'clock!
The dunk tank is now open!
Step right up and dunk me folks!
I'm talking to you, Cut-offs!
But enough about me, behold: ME!
Ha, you suckers!
Your pockets are empty and I'm still sittin' high and dry!
Boo!
Ha, boo!
I love it!
Hey, biceps!
I'm talking to you, haircut!
Take you best shot!
It's not fair, she doesn't even know what we're playing!
Robbie?
Is he that jerky twerp I see making goo-goo eyes at Wendy all the time?
Ha ha, conflict!
Hey!
I know a fight when I see one!
Stay right there!
Aw, he's gone!
I was just gonna call the boys over to place a few bets!
The smart money's on Skinny Jeans.
Just bonk him over the head!
It's nature's snooze button!
Sure, listen to your sister!
Maybe you can share dresses too!
BOOM!
Look, kid.
You got yourself a choice here.
You can either go face him like a man, or you can hide indoors like a wimp.
What'll it be?
Fears are for chumps.
That's why I don't have any.
Ugh, ugh!
We don't have one.
You know, studies show that keeping a ladder in the house is more dangerous than a loaded gun.
That's why I own ten guns, in case some maniac tries to sneak in with a ladder.
YOU'RE the one who's ackin' cray-cray!
I gotta go now.
Huh?
Is it Great Uncle's Day?
High heels?
You shouldn't have.
Seriously, wha- what?
What is this?
What?
That's why you bought me these?
You should be ashamed of yourself!
And on Great Uncle's Day no less.
But no, I don't have a fear of heights.
Turn it off!
So I have a fear of heights.
Is that really so cray-cray?
Eh, beats just sittin' around here being old.
Wait a minute, you're not planning on taking me someplace super high up, are you?
Alright, let's go.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I was expecting.
Oh boy, Of course not!
This thing is on stilts!
High high up!
I-I survived!
I survived and I feel great!
Wait, let me do a cocky dance just to be sure: Alala-loo-doodly-doo-doodly-doo!
HAHA!
DEAL WITH IT WORLD!
STAN PINES HAS CURED HIS FEAR OF HEIGHTS!
You comin', kid?
What's the matter, YOU got a fear of heights, now?
Haha!
Uh-oh.
I'm slower, but I jump higher.
The tax collector!
You found me!
Aah, uh, which one of these is the trap door?
Heh?
My one and only dream, which was to possess money, has come true!
You bet!
Uh, might wanna take another look there!
Ahahaha!
Wanna see what else is on TV?
I was awoken by the sound of mockery.
Where is it?
Show me the object of ridicule!
Hey, hey, don't get, short with your sister.
Ha ha!
And, and uh, he's short!
Tiny!
Soos is in on it now!
Ow, ooh, that's, aah.
Oy, you.
Hey, what's that?
Ha, ha, ha!
Hey, Soos, get in here!
I wanna take pictures of this!
Soos!
This maze of mirrors is your best idea that I'm taken credit for yet.
We're gonna make a fortune!
Have my ears always been this big?
I'm comin'!
Ha ha ha!
Oh yeah, this is gonna be your worst plot yet.
They're fine.
I saw them playing in the yard minutes ago.
Text me a photo?
Now you're not even speakin' Spanish!
Oh hi, Gideon, I've been looking for someone to try out my new mirror maze, then again, you're an idiot.
That's the end of the sentence.
Try and find me, twerp!
Ha, ha ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Hey!
Watch the merchandise!
You little troll!
Those mirrors cost me ten, I mean twenty-five, five-hundred.
Five-hundred dollars each, and you're paying for all of 'em!
Woah!
What is that thing?
I don't even know how to respond to this.
Look um, kid.
I think this rivalry thing is getting to you.
Ha, I understand.
I mean, I'm a formidable foe, what can I say.
Hey now, come on, you'll get me one of these days.
Maybe, you know, run your evil plan by some friends next time.
Workshop it, but first get your issues in order there.
Up over the carpet, there we go, around the end table, and out the door.
You're the light of my life too, pal.
Whoa, freak show.
Summerween!
The people of this town love Halloween so much, they celebrate it twice a year.
And wouldn't you know it, it's today!
Ha ha!
When the children come to my door tonight, they're gonna run away screaming from Stan Pines, Master of Fright!
Boo.
Uh-oh.
Think this one's leaking!
NOT TODAY!
Of course!
Let's move!
Trick-or-treaters.
Quick!
Give'em that terrible candy.
You got a cold, honey?
Something wrong with your voice there?
Ah, Summerween.
Those kids aren't gonna know what hit 'em!
What can I do for y, uh, ugh.
Oh no!
Augahhh!
Ah haha!
Huh?
What's the matter with you kids?
That was the scariest thing you've ever seen, right?
Well have you seen this!
Guts!
Real, very real guts!
Oh, you will be.
You will be.
Alright, you got me, kids.
You guys win.
I guess I'm not that scary, you know, you've-you've- Oh!
Ughh!
Why is there a pig jumping out of my chest?
What scares you two freaks?
What, what is this?
Some kinda, some kinda kitten or, Ahhhh!
What happened to you, Stan Pines?
What happened?
Wash off the shame, Stan.
Wash off the shame.
What's that?
Ahahaha!
Still got it!
How's it hangin'.
Candy?
How's that for candy?
You know, kids?
I've been thinkin'.
At the end of the day, Summerween isn't about candy or costumes.
Or even scaring people.
It's a day when the whole family can get together at one place and celebrate what really matters: PURE EVIL!
HAHAHAHAHA!
I like that guy's style.
Hot tamales, it's a jackpot!
Soos!
Make some new attractions!
Wendy!
Mark up those prices!
The higher the better!
Higher!
Bleed 'em dry!
That's not true.
Clean-up on the front lawn!
Ladies and gentle-tourists!
Looking around my Mystery Shack, you will see many wondrous roadside attractions.
Be amazed at the only known photo of a horse riding another horse!
That's-That's pretty good!
Be astounded at the horrible, pre-teen wolf boy!
Oh, look at him!
All that hair!
His body's changing, ah!
What?
I don't know de meaning of that word!
If you throw money at him, he dances.
Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Thank you!
What!
What the heck do you think you're doing?
Listen, kid.
You don't make money by giving stuff away.
You're off of register duty!
No buts except for yours out the door.
Now shut your yap and get to work!
Ugh.
Please never made me any money, kid.
In fact, just saying the word is giving me a burning sensation.
Yep.
Gluing dog hair to your body will do that.
Look, you guys got a problem with how I run the Shack, take it up with the complaints department.
Zing!
And don't stop 'till you've covered that sign with glitter!
Glittery signs attract tourists!
Also large birds.
Ha ha!
That's funny.
And remember, folks!
We put the fun in no refunds!
Ha ha.
Suckers.
Look, kid, let me break it down for you.
Being a boss is about commanding respect.
If you give people everything they ask for, they'll walk all over ya.
You think you know more about business than I do?
You think you could wear this hat?
I'd make more money on vacation then you would, running this place!
Interesting, All right, I'm a wagering man.
3 days. 72 hours. You run the Shack, and I'll go on vacation.
If you make more money than me, I guess it means you're right about the way I run my business.
BUT if you lose, you, uh, You have to wear this LOSER shirt all summer!
Whoa ho!
You got yourself a deal, missy!
See you in 72 hours!
We'll see who makes more money.
I'm here to take all the cash from your wheel.
Ugh!
This line is taking forever!
Time to use my old man powers, I'm having a heart attack!
And the only cure is to be a contestant on, on Cash Wheel!
Aaugh!
Someone give me a part!
I'm old!
I'M STAN, STAN PINES!
HA HA!
Did we, did we already do me?
Hello, I'm Stan.
Are there any 's'es?
I'm ready to solve!
Is it shut your yaps?
Cash shower, cash shower, cash shower!
Yes!
Doodle do...
See you tomorrow night, Mabel!
I'm givin' none of this to charity!
Rich, I'm a simple man.
So I'm gonna take my winnings, pack my bags, and, BET THEM ALL ON THE BONUS WORD!
Come on!
Tick-tock!
Time's up, kids!
Nice to see you learned how to dress while I was gone.
I won $300,000!
And then, Do I look like an idiot, folks?
The word is gimmee.
Two E's.
Pabracadabra!
Final answer!
Apparently that word can make you money.
Well, according to our bet, I guess Mabel's the new boss?
Huh?
What?
Yeah, well, I got to admit, It's kind of nice to be back, ya know?
Okay, okay, that's enough, get offa me!
And Soos, Wendy... get to work!
Ahem.
Please.
Uhh!
Still hurts.
N-no.
No, it didn't.
That never happened!
All right, let me just...
Uh, look, I'm not gonna...
I'm Stan, and I was wrong,
Hey, gimme that!
My back!
Kids, can one of you try explaining this to Soos?
To dispose of things that we don't want.
So long, Mystery Shack suggestion cards!
What you got there, Mabel?
Says you.
I'm not done getting rid of these yet!
Almost, Almost, Almost!
Well, it looks like we're down here for the long haul.
Who wants to see some card tricks?
Tada!
I'm not gonna answer that question.
Sorry.
It's just hard to focus on what you're saying with that squeaky puberty voice you got there.
Have any of you kids seen mah girdle?
Where mah girdle at?
What?
What's so funny?
I'm Grunkle Stay-an!
Kids laughing. Laughing at they Grunkle.
Dipper's pain is funny, but I'm starting to get bored.
Soos, tell a story.
I can't believe this nonsense.
Magic tonics?
Soos winning at something?
Where did you come up with this stuff?
I'll tell you a good story.
It's called Grunkle Stan wins the football bowl.
Thanks, beautiful woman.
But I couldn't have done it without my sidekick, Footbot.
What?
That story was great!
I even threw in a talking robot for the kids.
This attraction is gonna make me a fortune.
Easy with that bear, Corduroy!
I need him in showroom condition.
Come on, everyone's seen a bicycle-riding bear.
No, no.
I'm gonna teach this bear, to drive!
And the yellow light means speed up.
Uh oh.
What seems to be the problem, officers?
Oh, there is.
You see, I'm a very old man.
Not long for this Earth.
And the doctors assigned me a seeing eye bear to drive me to the hospital in case of an emergency.
Why, it's right here, inside my jacket.
There you go.
To the hospital, honeypants!
Mabel, when you get to be my age, you'll learn that you sometimes have to bend the truth for the greater good.
No, But I bet Soos has.
You know how he likes to eat.
See?
Greater good.
What?
What's going on?
Huh?
Mabel?
I ate it because I have little to no concern about other people's possessions or emotions.
That was strangely candid.
Almost as if I am unable to lie.
Well, good night.
Scrambled meat, here it is.
Usually, I spend the hour aggressively scratching myself in places I shouldn't mention.
Now I'm going to avoid making eye contact by pretending to read this newspaper and going to the bathroom without washing my hands.
Never mind the t-shirt!
Hey everyone, look at this guy's abnormal and unattractive face!
Doing my taxes.
Because I regularly commit massive tax fraud.
Sometimes, I think.
Is this all there is?
Is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line?
That we're all just biding our time until the sweet, sweet, release of death?
Kids, I think I have a growth forming on my back.
Just wanted to be honest with you guys.
Oh and I do.
You see, I lied to you.
In addition I've been parking in handicapped spaces, shoplifting fireworks, and smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines.
Also, you're fat.
What?
Author?
Hello?
Police station?
I forgot to tell him about my tax fraud.
No, tax fraud.
What's gotten into you kids?
I like the part with the bear.
The rest of it seems pretty far-fetched.
Not good!
Where, where are we?
But that's impossible.
No one will believe us.
This is stupid.
You called my bluff, pig.
Quick!
To the car!
Hey, kids, a little help here?
Alright!
Off to the pool!
Wait, what?
Aaaah!
Yeah, nothing like sitting in a moist tub with strangers.
It's like the bus, but wet.
Women.
Aaah!
Wendy?
Where's the lifeguard?
Aah!
She's attacking me with water!
There she is, Soos.
Equidistant from the snack bar and the bathroom.
Just the right amount of sun and shade.
And pointed away from where Old Man McGucket lotions himself.
The perfect lawn chair.
I just can't believe it wasn't already taken.
And now to sit on it, thereby claiming it as my own.
Gideon!
Get outta my chair, kid!
Move it, you little troll!
I'll first serve you!
Come on, Wendy!
You can't do this to an old man!
Two hours for roughhousing, but I'm innocent!
Look at him, that smug chair stealing jerk!
But I can't touch him, or the pool patrol will throw me in pool jail.
Hmm, Yes.
Yes!
Burn the child, Aah!
My eyes!
I-uh, I'm sleep walking!
Also now I'm sleep talking.
Nice hat, by the way.
Yeesh, alright, I'm goin'!
The coast is clear.
Now all I have to do is wait here 15 hours until the pool opens...
This was a good plan.
Hey!
What the
Kids, get the spatulas!
Kids!
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
It knows what I want.
And I want a pair of magic money pants.
It's not gonna happen.
Look kid, there's my room and the attic.
That's it.
What do you think, there's some kinda secret hidden room in the Shack?
Yeah, if you're into things that are terrible.
Wait a second.
So you both want this room, huh?
I guess I'll give it to whichever one of you I like more.
Uh oh.
Looks like my shoe's untied.
Muah ha ha.
To the kitchen!
Fight, fight, fight!
Okay, here's how it's gonna go down.
Whoever sucks-up the hardest get's the key to the new room.
Ten suck-up points for Mabel!
Trying too hard.
Minus 15 suck-up points.
Trying way too hard!
Plus 50 suck-up points!
Now, who wants to re-tile the roof in searing 105 degree heat?
He he.
Stan, you're a good uncle.
Dipper, you're phoning it in!
Man, that's refreshing.
10 suck-up points for this lemonade!
Thank you, Stan!
Oh-ho!
10 more for politeness.
Oh, and so sweet!
I have seen the face of beauty...
Those cannibals are onto something.
I taste delicious!
What's the word, Mabel?
Candy rocks?
Keep that up and I'll be giving your brother this key.
Well this is gettin' weird.
What's going on, Dipper?
Ah, you're at that creepy age where you spy on girls, huh?
Guess it's time you and me had a man to man talk.
About the birds and the bees, you know?
No way out of it!
Look.
It all begins with this little fella.
The pituitary gland.
He may be little, but he has BIG PLANS.
And now you know where babies come from!
You know, I find you more likable today than usual.
Maybe you could still win that game after all.
I was gonna give that new room to Mabel
What did you say to me?
Finally Stan'n up to me, huh?
Ha ha!
I love it!
You know, I made up my mind!
The room belongs to you.
Dipper.
Ssh.
You had me at shut up old man.
Oh good, Soos.
You got a second?
Look, times are tough, economy or something, et cetera.
Basically, I have to cut your pay.
Wha—what are you doing?
Is this some sort of negotiating tactic?
Because it's not gonna work!
Uh, Fine!
I was lying!
I'll give you a raise!
Just never do that again!
Nightmare!
Ah, a man and his own space.
So what are you gonna do with this old thing?
Haha!
You got it.
Yeesh, this carpet's ugly.
Ahh!
Why am I even out here at night?
What's with the pacing, kid?
You look even more freaked out than usual.
Aw, c'mon kid.
Try me.
I've seen this before.
Her name was Carla McCorkle. Carla Hotpants McCorkle.
My memories get a little hallucination-y at the end, but you get the gist.
You're darn right I do.
And we're gonna get to the bottom of it.
Right after I get to the bottom of this brown meat.
Om, nom, it's apocolicious!
Y'see, Dipper, music has sublimnal mind control hidden in it all the time.
If you listen closely, even the music I play in the Gift Shop has subtle hidden messages.
If you wanna hear the mind controlling messages, you gotta slow down the record.
Gimme that LP.
We're doin' something wrong here, but I can't put my finger on it...
Spit-take here I come.
Hm, that's not spit worthy.
What gives?
I'll rewind your face!
Holy mackerel!
Now there's your spit-take!
Finally, a good reason to punch a teenager in the face.
Let's roll!
Road safety laws, prepare to get ignored!
Wha-o!
Oof.
That's Mr Pines to you!
Haha!
We won!
Kid, this is a victory for every guy whose hands are too weak or fat to play a musical instrument.
Look, if it makes you feel any better, the apocalypse is coming soon.
Bury your gold!
...You've been buying gold, right?
Women.
They're the real mystery, Dip.
You ruin their date, drive their hippie boyfriend's van into a ravine...
and somehow you're the bad guy.
Ah, chin up, kid.
You were tryin' to do the right thing.
Even though you destroyed a relationship and part of my car.
Ah, I bet she will.
And until then, you can always go bowling with me.
Don't mention it, kid.
Wait a second, Is something rooting through our trash?
Hey, hey!
Get outta of here!
Darn beautiful men, always eating out of my trash...
Wait, what?
Save all questions until after the tour.
And up ahead if you look really closely, everybody get your cameras you're gonna wanna see this.
Mabel?
What are ya doing on the floor?
And I thought your brother was weird.
Ha ha ha.
That's pretty good.
Kissin' a pillow.
Ugh!
Outside!
Now!
That's just the natural order!
It's not my fault your pig's potentially delicious!
People don't roll around in their own filth.
Except for Soos.
Yeesh.
Isn't knitting matching sweaters for that pig enough?
Not now, kid, I got some tourists coming through.
He's a fat, naked, jerk.
Fine, yeah yeah, I promise.
I'm watching you, pig.
And here, ladies and gentlemen, is our final exhibit, the most hideous creatures known to man!
Right, right?
We, we have fun here.
But seriously, folks, THIS is something.
I present to you, a unicorn made OUT of corn, The Corn-i-corn!
I, I don't know, I'm tired.
What the!
Just ten minutes without this pig in the house.
Is that so much to ask?
Mabel asks, this never happened.
Oh but Grunkle Stan it's not safe out there!
There's predators!
Oh brother...
It, it took him.
The pig!
It took Waddles!
Um, uh, The good news is, you're gettin' a puppy!
Well, see, uh, when the uh, What?
I didn't put him anywhere!
I'm not acting suspicious!
YOU'RE acting suspicious.
What's a pig?
Uh, look, it went down like this, see?
So there I was, in the living room, tenderly nursing him on only the richest of creams.
When all of a sudden...
So I said, No dice, cowboy! And I started punching him right in the face!
But he played dirty, That really happened!
Why? Why couldn't you have taken me!
Uh, yeah!
I'm a great man, alright.
Dinosaurs aren't magic, they're just big lizards!
Get off my back.
But how do we even find the little guy?
Or, you know, we could just call it a day, maybe hit the pool hall, or... yeah!
Let's go save Woggles!
Him too.
Ugh, this guy.
Looks kinda hairy down there.
Oh yeah!
Heh heh, I did do that, didn't I.
Heh, heh heh heh...
No thanks.
You can't take a hint, can you.
Holy moley!
Forget the cornicorn, this is the attraction of a lifetime!
I could bring people down here and turn this into some sort of theme park!
Jurassic, Sap Hole!
This could be a gold mine!
Velvety-rope type deal there, ticket booth here, ha!
I should have put that pig outside ages ago!
What's that?
Wait, uh, if you think about it-
Look, he's an animal.
He belongs outside!
Look, you can't be serious.
Okay, okay.
How's about Mabel gets Soos a pig costume, and we use Soos as a human sacrifice!
What do you say, Mabel?
Ah, come on, you can't stop talking to me forever.
Are you nuts?
Get off me, you dumb pig!
Aaaaaaaaugh!
Oof!
Augh!
Ugh.
The dumb thing must be hungry.
I guess it's you or me, pig.
What are you looking at?
Aw come on, don't give me that look!
What am I supposed to do, let it eat me?
Argh!
Oh, I get it.
You're trying to guilt me.
Well it ain't working, pal.
Who cares if you're Mabel's favorite thing in the world?
I can live without the kid talking to me all the time! Telling me her jokes, makin' me laugh, Dang it!
Well, this is just about the dumbest thing I've ever done.
YOU WANT THIS PIG?
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THROUGH ME, YOU FLYING DEVIL!
COME AND GET ME!
From heck's heart I stabeth thee!
Here's your pig, kido.
Yeah, well.
Some times you just gotta.. LOOK OUT!
We're trapped!
Ah, well.
I can't have my favorite niece not talking to me.
And if I gotta leap onto a pterodactyl and punch him in the face, then that's what I gotta do.
W-what?
That's how I feel!
Oh, yeah.
Ha ha ha ha.
Uh-oh.
Snorting!
That's his tell!
I fold.
What?
I had 4 aces!
That pig is a wizard!
Look at him.
He's taunting me!
Ha ha, that's my girl!
The episode opens with a rainy day at the Mystery Shack, while Dipper and Mabel are playing Conflict Boat.
I need you to laugh at this with me!
He's always trying to trick me into losing the Mystery Shack.
Please, the only way Gideon's taking over this shack is by breaking in and stealing my deed.
Gideon!
Soos, broom.
Good luck, bucko!
The combo to this safe is in the one place he'll never find it: my brain.
I can relate to this.
Don't worry, I got this under control  Dipper, take care of it.
'Cause life ain't fair.
Now go fight a bat so we can watch TV.
I said do it kid.
Now!
The sink's clogged.
Dipper, get in here and fix it!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Jorge, Rico, you're the two best Colombian prison friends a fellah could make.
Sir, would you like to buy a Stan-Vac vacuum?
Stan-Vac: It sucks more than anything.
So, your, uh, your eye is weird, let's, let's talk about that.
This is going terrible.
I can't think of anything to say and she, looks weird up close.
Think of a way out!
NON-SPECIFIC EXCUSE!
No buts!
Now go and chop that firewood already!
Look, Soos, I'm gonna let you in on something.
Wanna know what I really think?
The kid's a loser.
He's weak!
He's an utter embarrassment!
I just wanna get rid of him.
If only people knew the truth, that hidden behind this vending machine, I secretly have a -
Hey, Mr Tummy!
Hey, Mr Stan!
Are you hungry?
Yes!
Eat your crackers!
Yum yum yum yum!
There ya go.
And now to input the code.
...and none more bottomless than the bottomless pit!
Which you can see here is bottomless.
Whooh!
Whatever that was, it's gone forever!
He's a loser.
He's weak.
I just wanna get rid of him.
Heh, yeah.
Those are all things people said about me when I was a boy.
It was terrible.
I was the biggest wimp on the playground!
So one summer, my pop signs up me for boxing lessons.
It was even worse than the school yard!
Y'know, that time I thought my pop was trying to torture me.
But wouldn't you know it?
The old man was doin' me a favor all along!
You see it?
That why I'm hard on Dipper.
To toughen him up.
So when the world fights, he fights back.
He's really comin' along!
When push comes to shove, I'm actually proud of him.
Just, don't ever tell him that.
His head is big enough as it is.
Whoa, kid, what are you doin' here?
Nice hole in your chest, by the way.
Let's fix that up.
Word to the wise, kid.
We're in the mind!
You can do what ever you imagine in here!
Huh, fighting back.
What?
Did what?
What are you all doing here?
And why was I dreaming of two brightly colored and radical young men?
What is this, a hug?
Not bad, kid.
Not bad.
What?
Bill?
Who?
What are you guys talking about?
That picture's taken out of context.
We gotta get the Shack back.
All right, that's it!
Listen up, people.
Gideon's a fraud!
This kid broke in and stole my property!
I'll show you who's the old man!
Ow, my hearing aid!
Don't worry, your son and daughter are fine.
Where're we staying?
Uh, I put 'em up in this amazing four-star hotel!
What, uh, sure we got— —plenty to eat.
Relax, if I thought I couldn't take care of these kids, I'd send them back right away.
Uh huh, you too.
Kids, we've got to talk.
Look I've been thinking and...
I can't take care of you anymore.
I don't have house or a job.
The plan is, you're goin' home.
Your bus leaves tomorrow, here are your tickets.
Look, I lost, okay?
The best thing is for you to be with your parents.
Sorry kids, Gideon won.
Summer's over.
Waiter, give me a glass of the strongest most expired apple cider you've got.
Soos?
What are you doing here?
You're a good man-child, Soos, but it's not lookin' good.
This whole town loves Gideon and hates me.
If only they knew how evil he really was!
The entire lower half of your body is on fire.
Sorry kids, it's for the best.
Well Stan, this is it.
Rock bottom.
No friends, no family, stuck watching infomercials for whatever that is...
How did you do it, kid?
Why are you always one step ahead?
Maybe he really is psychic after...
My hearing aid!
What keeps causing that?
Wait a minute!
That's it!
I know Gideon's weakness!
Wait!
Wait!
Stop everything!
I've got somethin' to say!
Just wait!
Look!
You guys all think Gideon is so perfect and honest, Oh!
I could never tell a lie!
I'm Gideon!
How's this for psychic?
Bam!
Take a good look!
That's right, these pins are hidden cameras!
And my hearing aid was picking up the feedback!
Who's the fraud now?
Just one more thing.
I believe this belongs to me.
The Mystery Shack is back, baby!
Ahaha!
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Uh, you kiddos settlin' back in okay?
I'm glad you showed me this, Dipper, AHAHAHA!
Now I know where you've been getting it all from!
Spookums and monsters.
This spooky book has been filling your head with crazy conspiracies!
Haha.
You gotta quit readin' this fantasy nonsense for your own good.
Although some of these would make great attractions!
Can't come up with this stuff!
Mind if I borrow this?
Magic book.
Ridiculous!
After all these years.
Finally, I have them all.
It's working!
Here we go.
Oh right.
Showtime.
Welcome, to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!
We're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk Li'l Gideon!
Please, please, boo harder!
But I didn't catch that porkchop all alone.
These two scamps deserve SOME of the glory
Okay, okay.
Most of the glory.
Your camera's a cinder block, Toby.
And don't forget to come to the after-party tonight at eight.
I would never agree to that ever.
The town loves us, we finally got that Gideon smell out of the carpet.
Everything is finally going my way.
Wha?
Journal?
You mean this old thing!
It was so boring I couldn't even finish it.
You didn't see nothing!
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?
Not gonna happen.
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?
The Mystery Shack is now closed, everybody out!
I will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly!
Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen!
What can I get you?
Key chains?
Snow globes?
These rare photos of American presidents?
Mysterious activity?
In the Mystery Shack?
You gotta be joking!
Hehe, I'm sorry agents.
The kid has an overactive imagination.
And like, a sweating problem.
Paranormal town stuff is just part of gift shop lore.
Sells more tickets you know?
Hold it kiddo.
Trust me, the last thing you want around during a party, is cops.
I'm confiscating that card.
Now how's about you being a normal kid.
Flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a window sill.
And don't go talking to those agents.
Listen kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing.
Trust me.
The whole town is showing up!
And no sign of those pesky agents.
Wendy, Dipper.
How are those posters coming along?
Hmm.
Kid, why did you call those agents?
I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times!
There's nothing supernatural going on in Gravity Falls.
All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days.
Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over – you're grounded.
Those agents could ruin everything.
Darn kid!
He has no idea what he's messing with.
He's stubborn, that's his problem.
Sorta like me, I suppose.
Ugh, I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now.
All right, let's see...
YOU TWO! ATTIC! NOW!
I said NOW!
All right, you undead jerks, YOU READY TO DIE TWICE?
The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me!
Take that!
And that!
Eat it, no eyes!
ANYONE ELSE WANNA PIECE?
Everything hurts.
Kid, I've always known.
I'm not an idiot, Dipper!
Of course this town is weird!
And the one thing I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous!
I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it.
To try to protect you from it!
It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
Invisible ink?
I can make noises with my body?
Sometimes intentionally.
Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.
Boys are a bore, let's show 'em the door.
Deal with it, zombie idiots!
Kids, listen.
This town is crazy.
So you need to be careful.
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch.
I'll let you hold on to that spooky journal, as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense, and not go looking for trouble.
Promise.
Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up.
Where's my handyman anyway?
Holy Moses!
Uhhh, big woodpecker.
Keep the change.
...I'm winking under my eye patch.
Now where'd those kids run off to?
Pacifica Northwest declares v-neck the look of the season!
What am I looking at here?
Is it legal for a child to wear that much make-up?
Would kicking all our butts at mini-golf cheer you up?
Destiny!
Holy smokes!
Someone in our family actually has talent!
Ah, don't worry about it kid!
The thing's random!
As far as I'm concerned, you're still better than anyone else in Gravity...
Soos, would it be wrong to punch a child?
Go to the golf course after dark, you say?
I don't know, we'd have to break in and-- Just kidding let's break in!
Oh, and hey, Mabel?
Knock her dead, kid.
Well, those kids are taking their time.
Looks like it's gonna be a while.
Well, this is gettin' weird.
Still ignoring this.
Woah, bag check for Dipper's eyes.
Ha ha!
Nobody?
It's like if coffee and nightmares had a baby!
Are you kidding me?
I would never miss, whatever this is.
Whoa!
Children fighting!
I can sell this.
Not once ever.
Please, don't let my horrible elderly face frighten you.
Don't you want to use that nickel to get a nugget from old Goldie?
Watch this!
What?
Sure, he's a little rusty around the edges, but old Goldie is a classic show-stopper, like me.
Huh?
Aaaah!
Kill it!
KIIILLL IIIITTT!
Soos, a little advice.
You need to get rich.
Or lie about being rich.
Outside of that, I don't like your chances.
Would you date him?
I'm gonna find a replacement for old Goldie.
Babysit Soos while I'm gone.
Tossing away garbage, in the garbage can.
Phew!
Ah, don't look at me like that.
This is how it's gotta be.
What in the...?
What is this living nightmare?
And why do kids love it so much?
Hoooaah!
Sir, I would like to buy that badger.
I'm gonna get that badger.
You don't understand, Wendy!
This animatronic badger sings, it dances.
It's the perfect money taking attraction.
But he won't sell it to me!
He didn't come in today.
It's the first time he's missed work ever!
Hello, old friends.
I've gotta be careful this time.
No more Colombian nights.
Nothing you can say will change my mind, Wendy.
Sometimes, a man has to steal an animatronic badger, to stay in this crazy game called life.
It's about the principle.
No one tells Stan Pines he's out of the game.
No one tells, whoa!
Thank you.
Wha, what the?
Stay back, you monster!
Yes, yes, get 'em Goldie, get 'em!
You did it!
You old beautiful monster.
You did it!
How's about you and me hit the town?
These old-has-beens' are going to Vegas!
Pretend I didn't say that.
Come in, come in, but be warned: if you enter, you may be subjected to my tales...
TALES DESIGNED TO SELL MY MERCHANDISE!
Sorry, I was thinking of somethin' funny I heard earlier.
You've come to the Mystery Shack after hours.
A time when the most cursed objects are for sale!
Like that thing!
There, 
Nope?
Not a fan?
Too many orifices?
Alright, I can tell what you're looking for is this disembodied hand!
Why is it so expensive?
Well, that's quite a tale.
And it's called HANDS OFF!
No seriously, hands off that's not for sale.
Alright, HANDS OFF!
Look at these faux-gold beauties!
They're mob boss quality!
Okay, kids.
Prepare to watch the delicate art of the deal.
Hey Hagface!
How much for the junk watches?
Alright, I get it, you're creepy.
Anyway, less talky, more watchy.
AAH!
YEESH!
Freak show!
And their observation skills.
BOOM!
Good job, heisting hands.
That sounded like a curse!
Hey, anyone want to buy a wet blanket?
We got a wet blanket for sale!
Hah!
Curse?
Yeah, right.
AAH!
Wait, is this curse-ugly or just normal ugly?
Heh.
Looks like I got off scot-free.
Alright kiddos, breakfast time.
Prepare your mouths for-
So I might have got cursed a little.
But the watch looks nice, right?
That's better.
What?
That old crone should apologize to me for denying my right to buy cheap junk.
I don't need hands.
I've got self-respect!
Mabel, sweetie, will you make your uncle some hands?
Nice work, kid!
See, hands are overrated.
I'm ready to take on the day.
Ma'am.
No, Jimmy, wait, not today!
NOT TODAAAY!
Let's find that witch.
Stop saying Hand Witch.
Kid, I can't tap anything.
Hands!
Lots of hands!
Alright, you horrible wench.
You got me.
Stealing is wrong, et cetera.
Take it.
Now can I have my hands back?
I have a certain gesture I'd like to share with you.
It's alright, kids.
Just look away.
What?
Forget it!
I'm not kissing any of that mess!
I don't need my hands that bad!
Let's go, kids.
Well, yeah, look at this horror show!
It's creepy even for a cave.
How about Here's your hands back?
Shakey!
Scratchy!
I've missed you, old rascals.
You're all right, sister.
Nope.
Never.
Well.
I learned nothing.
Alright, I get it.
You don't want the hand.
You're a savvy customer.
But perhaps you'd be interested in buying...
This magic pig!
Sure, he doesn't look magic, but there's a very interesting story I'm about to make up about him.
And it's called: ABACONINGS!
You know what, you're right.
Don't buy the pig.
In fact, I'm probably better off leaving him with my niece.
No shooting in the house, sweetie!
But perhaps I can interest you in something else.
Like these spooooky moooovies.
Movies are great!
You watch the movie, you scare the girl, the girl snuggles up next to you, next thing you know you gotta raise a kid.
Your life falls apart.
Forget that last part.
This next tale is called Clay Day!
Well, that just put me 90 minutes closer to death.
It's time you kids learned to watch the classics from my day.
Well.
Your sister's broken.
Heh heh.
Come on, those hogey old things?
How scared could she be?
Kid, it's just a movie, it can't hurt you!
There's got to be a way to get her over this!
Huh, Alright.
If we can just get the director to show her the models are fake, maybe she'll finally calm down.
The man wants his privacy.
I can respect that.
Well, everyone over the fence.
You see, Mabel, those monsters are just clay models moved around one frame at a time, by an antisocial shut-in.
We wanna get a look at your figurines!
Kid, listen to me.
For the last time, there is nothing here to be afraid--
It's slowly swiping at us!
Harry Claymore!
Master of special effects!
Circa-1970's-something.
Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you.
You were right!
Stop-motion is pure evil.
We're safe now kids.
We're safe.
I don't get it.
You don't want the pig, you don't want my tapes, WHAT ARE YA GONNA BUY?
How about this delicious potion?
Here, have a free sample.
You should have bought my merch when you had the chance, buddy.
But that's okay.
I'll have something new for sale very soon.
Heh heh heh heh...
And here we have our latest attraction: the legendary Cheapskate.
Heh!
Just an optical illusion.
Come along, everyone.
Step right up, AHAHAHA!
That's right, I'm a jerk!
All right, you're getting closer.
Every day it's getting stronger.
Haha, yes!
I don't care if it's dangerous.
I don't care how long it takes.
I'm gonna pull this off, and no one's gonna get in my way!
Open to the Infinetentiary in the year 207~012.
I even petitioned the government to have this day removed from calenders.
Now I'm not allowed on airplanes.
Think this place used to be a mattress store.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, to see my latest attraction.
A man, made of wax, and several other people, made of wax, It's a whole wax exhibit.
That is it!
You are singlehandedly the worst handyman I've ever seen.
Hey you, gumdrop.
Think you can fix a golf cart?
Boom.
You're hired.
One size fits all.
Step right up to the Mystery Shack folks, step right up...
What the, Oh no.
Hot air balloons.
Folk music!
It's the Woodstick Festival!
Soos!
Lock down the shack and hide my shirts before anyone tie-dyes them!
They're slow.
I could probably take a few down.
You really think I could make money off of these free-loading, kale-munching freak shows?
Hmm.
How do I appeal to young people?
So young people are into hot air balloons, ehh?
Balloon faster, Soos.
We need this thing up in the air before the festival ends.
I'm sure about everything.
Now lube up those engine gears with some kerosene!
More kerosene!
It's finally done.
When these idiots see this balloon, they'll understand that I love young people.
What the H?
What's everybody crying about?
In my day zeppelins fell from the sky like raindrops.
You know what?
Being loved by the youth is overrated.
Being feared, now that's priceless.
Come on, come on.
Should be just enough to finish the job.
Whew.
Can't be too careful with this stuff.
Warning, blah blah blah, Extreme usage could result in minor gravity anomalies.
Can it, Poindexter!
I've come this far.
I'm not givin' up now!
Yes, this is it.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but it'll all be worth it.
Just eighteen more hours.
Finally, everything changes.
Today.
Not so fast, kids!
There is no way on earth you're setting off those dangerous, illegal fireworks, without me.
Here you go, sweetie.
Set something on fire for your Grunkle Stan.
Uh, do you have a permit for being totally lame?
But seriously though we should probably clean this mess up.
I don't see why not.
This is what Saturdays are for.
Doing dumb things forever.
Whoa, there!
Alright, alright.
I tell you it's unnatural for siblings to get along as well as you do.
Yeah, plenty of summer left.
Kids, there's something I, uh, something I should tell you.
It's um Well it's complicated.
I, I'm gonna go refresh my soda.
Enjoy it while you can, Stan.
They'll find out sooner or later.
Today's the day.
What is that, a ladybug?
What the...?
Oh no!
Ugh!
Hey, hands off, you stooge!
Aah!
I don't understand!
What did I do that warrants this much arresting?
What?
You think that's me?
But I actually am dumb!
Last night I was stocking the gift shop.
I swear!
Kids, you gotta believe me!
For once I'm actually innocent!
Kids!
Uh, guilti-cent!
I mean, inno-guilty!
Um, can I have my phone call?
Just pick up!
Listen, I need something from you.
You know that vending machine in the gift shop?
I need you to guard it with your life.
No matter what happens, no matter who talks to you, don't let them touch that machine.
Only five more hours till it happens.
I gotta be there!
Come on, Stan, you gotta think of a way outta this.
Think!
Think!
They're getting stronger.
Of course, that's it!
Gah!
Hot Belgian waffles!
Wait, I'm alone.
I can swear for real!
SON OF A...
What?
Um, can't we stick around for maybe one minute?
Uh, one minute thirty seconds?
Bathroom break?
Just give me, fifteen seconds!
Oh, yeah?
So do you.
Do you know where the Mystery Shack is?
Okay.
Here's a hundred bucks.
Drive as far away from the Shack as possible, and don't stop when the cops start chasing you!
I gotta be there when it happens!
Aah!
DON'T TOUCH THAT BUTTON!
Dipper, just back away.
Please don't press that shutdown button, you gotta trust me.
Look, I know this all seems nuts, but I need that machine to stay on!
If you'd just let me explain, Uh-oh, oh, no!
Brace yourselves!
Wh-whoa-aaaah!
Mabel, Mabel, wait!
Stop!
Aah!
Soos, what're you doing?
I gave you an order!
Soos, you idiot, let me go!
No, you can't!
You gotta trust me!
Then listen to me.
Remember this morning when I said I wanted to tell you guys something?
I wanted to say that you're gonna hear some bad things about me, and some of them are true, but trust me.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about, it's all for this family!
Look into my eyes, Mabel!
You really think I'm a bad guy?
Mabel, please!
The author of the journals, my brother.
Heh!
Yeah, you should keep up.
Uh, ladies first.
Ha ha!
Good thing you've got your smarts, Poindexter.
I've got the other thing.
What is it called?
Oh, right, punching!
Splinters!
Hey, don't worry, bro.
Wherever we go, we go together.
Don't forget to leave our names so they know who owns the place.
Finally!
After all these long years of waiting, you're actually here!
Brother!
What the heck was that for?
Warnings, schmarnings.
How's about maybe a thanks for saving you from what appears to be, I don't know, some kind of sci-fi sideburn dimension?
What I did?
Why, you ungrateful...
Don't expect me to go easy on you, just because you're, family.
They're your family, Poindexter.
Shermie's grandkids.
No, just us.
Also maybe the entire US government.
Okay okay okay, I have a lot of explaining to do.
It all started, a lifetime ago, nineteen sixty something.
Glass Shard Beach, New Jersey.
I lived with my ma and pa in the Lead Paint District in the family pawn shop.
Dad was a strict man.
Tough as a cinderblock and not easily impressed.
Ma was a pathological liar, which served her well as a phone psychic.
And then there was my nerdy twin brother, Stanford.
As if his abnormally high IQ wasn't enough, he also had a rare birth defect: six fingers on each hand.
Which might have explained his obsession with sci-fi mystery weirdness.
As for me, I had what mom liked to call: personality.
But as different as we were, we were the perfect team.
And every day we'd wander the beach, looking for adventure.
Whoooaa, This is the greatest thing I've ever seen!
And I've once seen a dead rat floatin' in a bucket!
Huh, you know what this thing's missin'?
You would know, Crampelter!
Get lost!
Hey.
Don't let those idiots get to you.
Hey, chin up, buddy.
Look.
One of these days, you and me are gonna sail away from this dumb town.
We'll hunt for treasure, get all the girls, and be an unstoppable team of adventurers.
High six?
Those were the good times.
Those bullies may have been right about us not making many friends, but when push comes to shove, you only really need one.
Ford's brains seemed to get more impressive every year.
So did our pet project.
Sure I got in more than my fair share of trouble, but when your brother's the smartest kid in school, you've always got a leg up on the competition.
The future was lookin' bright.
For both of us.
Till one day...
Ah, great, what is it this time?
Heh.
Joke's on them if they think you wanna go to some stuffy college on the other side of the country.
Once we get the Stan O' War complete, it's gonna be beaches, babes, and international treasure hunting for us.
Beep boop. I am a nerd robot. That's you. That's what you sound like.
And if they are?
Without Ford I was just half of a dynamic duo.
I couldn't make it without him.
And now, thanks to that dumb college, I was gonna lose my brother forever.
This is all your fault, ya dumb machine!
Oh no.
Oh no no, what did I do?
There.
Alright.
Good as new.
Probably.
One-paddle-paddle-paddle, two-paddle-paddle.
Man, that Jackie-O, what a fox.
Hey, what's the word, Sixer?
Ho-okay.
I might have accidentally been, horsing around...
Look, this was a mistake!
Although if you think about it, maybe there's a silver lining.
Huh?
Treasure hunting?
Wait, no, I can explain, it was a mistake!
What?
Stanford, tell him he's bein' crazy!
Stanford?
Don't leave me hangin'.
High six?
Fine.
I can make it on my own!
I don't need you!
I don't need anyone!
I'll make millions and you'll rue the day you turned your back on me!
Thanks to one dumb mistake I had no brother, no home, no nothing.
But I had a plan to fix everything.
Kid, will ya knock that off?
I'm tryin' to tell my life story here.
I had decided I wasn't gonna show my face at home until I made something of myself.
Unfortunately, the treasure-hunting business was slow going.
Apparently gold was some kind of, rare metal.
Luckily I struck a different kind of gold... in sales.
Hi! I'm Stan Pines of Stan Co Enterprises.
Are sick of this always happening to you?
Then you need the Shammy of the future!
Made with the same material astronauts use to clean up cranberry stains on the moon!
That's the Sham Total!
It's a total sham.
I had made my mark, all right.
Unfortunately, so did the Shammies.
Apparently the cheap dye I used to color them only made stains worse.
Customers went crazy about that.
Fortunately they were using Stan Co brand pitchforks.
SUCKERS!
I was officially banned from New Jersey, but with a quick name change, Steve Pinington was ready to take on Pennsylvania.
I'm Steve Pinington!
Are you sick of bandages that are hard to remove?
Then what you need is the Rip Off!
The Rip Off won't give you rashes, I repeat: it won't give you rashes.
It gave ya rashes.
I traveled the whole country, sometimes outside of it, always one step ahead of the law, looking for something that would be my big break.
Meanwhile, your old uncle Stan was doing great.
I had come up with a sophisticated new business strategy.
Come on, owl, owl, football player with an omelet! Gah!
I was in great shape, living on my own, and the best part was: I didn't need help from nobody.
Just give me a few more days, Rico!
I'll pay your goons back, I swear!
You haven't seen your brother in over ten years.
It's okay.
He's family.
He won't bite.
Well, I can always count on you for a warm welcome.
Eh, hello to you, too, pal.
Uh, you gonna explain what's going on, here?
You're acting like Mom after her tenth cup of coffee.
Hey, uh, easy there.
Let's talk this through, okay?
Look, I've been around the world, okay?
Whatever it is, I'll understand.
There is nothing about this I understand.
That's it?
You finally wanna see me after ten years, and it's to tell me to get as far away from you as possible!
No, no.
You don't understand what I've been through!
I've been to prison in three different countries!
I once had to chew my way out of the trunk of a car!
You think you've got problems?
I've got a mullet, Stanford!
Meanwhile, where have you been?
Living it up in your fancy house in the woods!
Selfishly hoarding your college money, because you only care about yourself.
Well, listen to this: you want me to get rid of this book?
Fine, I'll get rid of it right now!
You said you wanted me to have it so I'll do what I want with it!
You want it back, you're gonna have to try harder than that!
You left me behind, you jerk!
It was supposed to be us forever, you ruined my life!
Some brother you turned out to be.
You care more about your dumb mysteries than your family?
Well then YOU CAN HAVE 'EM.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what's going on?
Hey, hey, Stanford...
Oh, no, what do I do?
Stanford?
Stanford, come back!
I-I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
I just got him back!
I can't lose him again!
Ah, come on!
STANFORD!
I'd lost him.
I didn't know if he was dead or alive in some distant galaxy, but I knew his journal must have the answer to getting him back.
Somehow.
I didn't get much sleep that night.
Or the night after that.
I tried for weeks to turn that dumb machine back on.
But without the other two journals it was hopeless.
Finally I ran out of food.
I had no choice but to go into town.
Uh, n-no, no.
You've got the wrong guy.
Really I- Yes, I do give tours!
Ten, nah-no, fifteen bucks a person!
Oh, uh, Stan, ford.
Stanford Pines.
Step right up, folks, uh, to a world of, enchantment, or whatever.
Behold, the um, nerdy science box.
Uh, I can assure you, that is in no way permanent.
Uhh, You're lucky you weren't part of the last tour group, um, they never made it out aliiiivve.
Heheh.
Right?
So I came up with a plan.
I couldn't leave my brother's house until I figured out how to save him, but I needed to pay his mortgage somehow.
For once in my life, people were actually buying what I was selling.
And so the Murder Hut was born!
Later renamed the Mystery Shack.
Finally I found something I was good at.
For once being a liar and a cheat paid off.
The old me was dead, and I'd faked a car crash to prove it.
By day I was Stanford Pines: Mr Mystery.
But by night I was down in the basement, trying to bring the real Stanford back.
I couldn't risk anyone learning the truth and sabotaging my mission, so I lied to everyone: the town, my family, your parents, even you kids.
That's okay, kid.
I probably wouldn't have believed me either.
Oh no, it's too late, the agents are comin' for us!
Let's not go crazy... it was serviceable.
All right, kids, it's been a long day and me and my brother have a lot to talk about.
Why don't you hit the hay, huh?
I said. Hit. The hay!
Look at us.
When did we become old men?
Ugh, uck, don't say that.
You really aren't gonna thank me, are you?
Fine.
On one condition: you stay away from the kids... I don't want them in danger.
Cause as far as I'm concerned, they're the only family I have left.
Kill it!
Kill it!
Great.
Now get it outta here.
It smells like if death could barf.
No, do take it hard.
Take it hard and serious.
My brother is a dangerous know-it-all, and the stuff he's messing with is even worse.
Do yourself a favor and stay away from him, you hear me?
Don't worry about what's in the basement.
You belong up here with me and Mabel.
Huha, yeah!
Quack quack, quack quack...
Say, is this that game that's mostly math and writing and isn't anything like the picture on the box?
Look, kid, I prefer to do my dice rolling in Vegas.
Besides, only a game designed by nerds would have charisma as a fantasy power.
Heh.
Check this out: When facing yon adversaries, shield thyself, under an elfin buttress.
Buttress.
And I recreated the main character out of some spare taxidermy parts.
Quack quack.
I'm the duck detective!
Who stole my breadloaf?
Heh.
Yeah.
Where is the little squirt anyway?
I haven't seen him all afternoon.
It's a big night.
I think we all remember where we were, when we learned Duck-tective was shot.
Oh, why, why with this?
You wanna break a record, Ford?
You already got it with world's nerdiest old man.
I'll have you know that Duck-tective has a big mystery element!
And a lot of humor that goes over kids' heads!
Oh, what, fifty magical dwarf dollars?
I'll mock all I want, it's my TV room!
What?
Now you listen to me!
As long as I live I will never, ever, Play your smartypants nerd game!
Eh, is this normal?
Eh, maybe let 'em get a couple bites in Ford's brain first.
Even things out smartness-wise.
Alright, alright.
I guess if we have no other choice, we'll go on a, (Sighs) epic wizard quest.
Everyone grab a weapon.
We must be getting close.
These fairy bites are getting more frequent.
He's magic, sweetie.
I'm sure he's fine.
There's no cops in the forest.
We take this to our graves.
What?
Oh, come on!
Seriously, can't we just, like, arm wrestle or something?
Uh, just make with the rules, ugly.
What do we do?
What are our moves?
What?
Really?
I cast, uh, shield of, shielding!
We're doing it!
Mabel, I am so confused and so proud right now.
Come on, you guys!
Hey, long odds are what you want when you're a world class gambler!
Alright, Stan, you can do this, Papa needs a new pair of, TWINS!
Sorry, nerd-wizard.
All your smarts are no match for dumb luck.
Hey, a gambler never reveals his secrets.
Y'know, I'm sorry for making fun of your game, kiddo.
Sure, it might be too nerdy for me, bust it's just the right amount of nerdy for you and my brother.
If you two wanna hang out sometimes, I won't get in your way.
Ugh.
Rough start to a day.
But it's all gonna be worth it when I fix that light bul...
I thought we were out of light bulbs.
Well, TV at least you appreciate me.
Give me the good news.
That was a good day.
Hold it right there Bud!
I'm taking you on!
Oh yeah?
Well your face is more fat, than, not fat!
Whaddya say folks?
Are we just gonna let Bud win?
How about a real election!
Running for mayor!
Did I, did I not make that clear?
Look, kids.
The mayor kicking the bucket got me thinking.
I'm an old man, and I'm not getting any younger.
My dumb brother's research is probably gonna make him famous.
And what do I have to show for my life?
Do I really want crooked grifter on my tombstone?
How about, crooked mayor!
I got my mouth, don't I?
Meh, I can take it or leave it, too many stripes.
Next question.
Ha, simple.
Put them on an island and make them fight for dominance.
Also teach kids swears.
That'll bring them to the real world.
Wait, do you mean crime in general, or just the specific crimes committed by m
Heh heh.
Sorry kids.
I always say words that come out of my brain.
If my head says, that lady's got an ugly baby, my mouth says, whoa, lady, you got one ugly baby.
Ugh.
Do I really have to wear this thing?
It looks like a flag threw up on me.
Hiya there!
Stan Pines here.
Let's get real.
Do you think the women of Gravity Falls wear too much makeup?
Uh, what I meant to say was: you ladies all look great.
And have you done something with your hair?
Girl, you are working it!
Whew!
I'm Stan Pines.
You may know me as the guy who accidentally let all those bees loose in that elementary school a few years back.
But I believe in things.
America.
Freedom.
Ameri-freedom!
Like my opponent pointed out, I may not have a pretty face, but if you want a candidate that will listen to you, well, I'm proud to be all ears.
Now, watch me break it down!
Eh, I don't know.
I just opened my mouth and spoke from the heart, or, gut, or something.
And what is that sound?
Why are people jamming their hands together?
They, love...
Tad, that means so much coming from you!
Hey-o!
Now just the ladies!
Now just the ladies my age!
Woof!
Never mind.
Now this I could get used to!
Aw come on, have you seen the polls?
I can debate naked and I can still win!
Huh, come to think of it, Ugh!
What do you kids have to constantly tell me what to do?
Everyone in this town is finally showing me respect!
Maybe you kids should too.
I am taking this seriously!
If you haven't noticed, everything that has come out of this golden mouth has put us on top!
With or without your dumb advice!
Yeah!
Dumb advice.
Well, you can tell that know-it-all Ford that he can keep his fancy light bulbs and magic ties!
I'm gonna win this debate on my own, without any of you!
Oh, don't you tee-hee me.
I'll debate you into the ground.
You're making me very uncomfortable right now.
Wait a minute.
What?
Those backstabbing...
Easy!
Taxes are the worst.
I propose we stimulate the economy by waging wars on neighboring cities.
We. Have. The cannons.
What?
Uh, And uh, that is why, um, the Statue of Liberty is our hottest landmark.
Alright alright, she's kind of mannish.
What do you want from me?
Augh.
You're dying out there, Stan.
You kids were right all along.
I should have listened to you when I had the chance.
What the...?
Listen, everybody!
This debate is over!
I gotta go save my family!
Can it, Gleeful!
No, stop it!
Thank you, but stop it!
Aah!
Get back, you terror birds!
Kids!
Look, I'm sorry I was being stubborn.
I guess being the town's hero wasn't enough.
I wanted to be yours too.
I can still drop you, you know.
Kids.
If I die, make sure I get a bigger tombstone than Ford.
Oh boy.
What didn't I do?
That llama knew too much.
Whew!
At least they didn't list any of the bad ones.
On an unrelated topic, I have a lot of cheap pugs and I need to move them fast.
Eh, maybe it's for the best.
I got close to the dream, though, kids.
I got campaign confetti in my eyes!
Come on, kids.
Wanna go vandalize Mayor Tyler's mansion?
No te preocupas!
Vamos!
Vamos!
IT'S THE COPS!
GUN IT!
My brother is a dangerous know-it-all...
MONEY!
More like revenge trip.
Every year my tourist trap competitors prank the Mystery Shack.
Last year those hooligans duct taped Soos to the ceiling.
Well, no more!
This year we're visiting every tourist trap along the Redwood Highway, and I'm gonna prank back every single one.
The more the merrier.
Just sign these non-disclosure agreements.
None of your parents are lawyers, right?
Kid, those useless pamphlets have never helped a single person.
The only wrinkly old travel guide you'll need is me.
Now look alive!
We're coming up on an attraction run by the most black-hearted proprietor in all of Oregon.
Don't let the face fool you.
This woman lit my car on fire on two non-consecutive occasions.
Dipper, hup to!
This ball a' yarn ain't gonna prank itself.
Something on your mind, kiddo?
You're thinking about miss cold shoulder over there, huh?
Heh, yeah.
Chances.
Whoa.
Never say that about yourself.
Lucky for you I'm an expert on women.
Listen to me, kid.
When it comes to girls always be confident.
And be funny, but not too funny.
And be kinda annoying but in a lovable way.
Hey, jerky is just a term non-jerks use to bad mouth innocent jerks.
Confidence, comedy, some third word starting with a C.
The three Cs of the Stan Pines dating technique!
At the next tourist trap, try out my advice on the first girl you see.
Hey, I'm full a good ideas.
Speakin' of which, everyone!
Now!
Ah, Upside-Down Town.
The nausea capital of the state.
Whatever you do, don't use the bathrooms.
Alright, kid.
This is it.
Be confident.
Now, Soos!
Not so upside-down now!
No, no, no.
You practice.
The more girls you talk to, the better you get at it.
And that's just the tip of the advice-berg.
Everyone on board?
So then I said to the bouncer, Where's your ID, ugly?
 That's where I got this scar.
That's the Stan Pines method, kid.
Works every time.
Please.
That's the best part 'a flirting on a road trip.
You're not gonna see any of these gals again.
To moving on!
Man, coyotes sound a lot worse than I remember.
Alright, campers.
We got another day 'a breakin' laws and breakin' hearts.
Everything up until now has been a walk in the park compared to our next attraction.
Eh, sort of.
There she is, kids.
Mystery Mountain.
Five times the size of the Mystery Shack, and what's worse: she has real attractions.
Even their made up legends are better than ours.
Today, the mountain falls.
Eh, I don't know, sure.
Alright, road dogs!
I got five bucks for whoever can tip the big blue ox!
Go, go, go!
Hey, what's up with the mopey mug, kid?
He-hey!
Look at this little champion!
Don't you see what's happening here?
That's your dumb obsession with Wendy gettin' in the way of your future!
If you wanna move on, you've gotta say yes to whatever comes your way.
Speaking of which, Ah ah ah!
Watch and learn.
Oh, I seem to have lost my number!
Can I borrow yours?
Heheh.
Well, between you and me, what I'm doing here is a little secret.
Take my advice or don't, but clearly I know what I'm doing.
Heh, don't worry, toots.
That spider people stuff is just an urban legend.
I can't believe people fall for it.
What can I say?
I'm a real catch.
Uh, I think your contacts fell out...
Heeey, buddy boy.
So remember how we were talking about my technique?
Well, sometimes it leads to unexpected consequences.
The good news is, I've solved the mystery of where Oregon's mummies come from.
The bad news is, I'm about to become one.
Turns out Darlene is one of those spider people.
But beyond that, the date's been okay.
I don't know.
One minute we're having the perfect date, and the next minute she's growing extra legs and encasing me in webbing.
Women, right?
I was blinded by flattery!
Also, this acid she spit in my face.
I'm up the mountain at Widow's Peak.
You got it.
You tricked me!
I'm 80% certain you don't really love me at all!
You, you didn't mean it about my shoulder hair?
Come on, Dipper, where are you?
Please.
I don't know if you're really up there or not, but if you are, please save me, Paul Bunyan!
Whoa, did that really work?
Quick!
Before the rest of the venom sets in!
Ride like the wind, sky tram!
We're doomed!
Kid, are you crazy?
Kid, that was ingenious!
How'd you know that would work?
What?
After all that?
Seriously, do I look like an amnesiac?
You know, I actually have.
Comedy is too subtle these days.
My style involves more over-sized props.
Here, let me get you out from there--
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Aah!
Get the car, get the car!
Alright, kid.
I gotta admit something.
I'm no expert on women.
Truth is, I've been divorced once, and slapped more times than I can remember.
Confidence can buy you a lot, but at the end of the day, pickup artists tend to get our heads bitten off.
When it comes to women, I'm a failure.
Ah, come on.
Everyone loves my pranks!
And the best part is, I never have to face any consequen--SWEET LORD!
Aw, come on!
I don't understand.
I completely don't deserve this.
That's not the only good news coming up!
In one week my senior citizen's ponytail kit is coming in the mail.
I'm, I'm kinda going through some things.
The future.
Not so fast, goofus and girl-goofus.
After that zombie incident, no one's throwing another party at my house.
I keep finding little bits of the undead in the couch cushions.
Hey, everything all right, pumpkin?
Ah, nobody likes gettin' older.
But just because you're growing doesn't mean you have to grow up, you know?
I mean, look at me.
I'm pushin' seventy and I still eat ice cream for dinner.
Hey, at least whatever happens after this summer, you'll still have your brother along with you through thick and thin.
Not everyone can say that, you know.
That's it, goat!
It's time I threw you off this property for good!
On second thought, I'm gonna run like a coward now.
Kids!
I can't believe it!
I thought I lost you two!
I've missed you knuckleheads, too.
It's good to have you back.
Shhh, keep it down.
Welcome to what's left of normal around here.
Home base.
So I was hammering signs out back when the sky started vomiting nightmares.
I listen to a lot of AM radio so I knew what this meant: the end of the world.
What I didn't expect was what happened next.
Turns out whatever you and my brother did to the shack with your unicorn voodoo made the crazy place invincible to weirdness.
That's when Possum Breath over here shows up leading a bunch of injured stragglers through the forest.
They needed a place to stay and since the mayor got captured, I elected myself de facto chief.
The plan's to stay in here and eat Brown Meat until we run out, then I vote we eat the gnomes.
Shh!
Shh!
Stress will make you chewy.
Serves that jerk right.
My brother's had some stupid plans, but going up against an all-powerful space demon was his worst one yet.
Trust me, we have everything we need right here.
It's not the Ritz but at least the monsters inside know how to massage.
You know Shiatzu?
Look, kiddo.
We got a good deal here.
Besides, I'm sure wherever the rest of the townsfolk are, they're fine.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Have you all forgotten who's in charge here?
Besides, we're only safe inside!
It's not like we can take the Mystery Shack to Bill.
Discuss nothing!
These scribbles are a bunch of cockamamie balderdash!
Excuse my French.
And where would you even find a bunch of idiots who would be crazy enough to build it?
Whoa-what!
What are you...?
H-hey now!
Hey hey!
Don't touch that!
Hey!
Aah!
This whole plan is bonkers.
But of course no one asked the chief what he thinks.
After all I've done for everyone!
Yeah, exactly, it's a total load of Shmebulock.
It's this darn plan to save my brother.
If you didn't notice, I already saved him once from that portal, and he never thanked me!
He causes the end of the world, and somehow it's still always Stan's the screw-up.
Ford's the hero.
Well maybe if he hid in the Mystery Shack, he wouldn't have been captured!
This was a bad idea.
Does this thing have an escape hatch?
Hey, on second thought, maybe we could come up with a plan that doesn't involve us plummeting to our certain death-
Great!
Grab him and let's get out of here.
Hey, good to see you too, bro.
Now let's get outta here, huh?
Drawing a circle on the floor.
Well, he's lost his mind.
You realize this is a bunch of hogwash, right?
You really think some caveman graffiti is gonna stop that monster?
Whoa.
Hey.
I'm not the enemy here, people.
Don't forget who literally created the end of the world.
Fine.
Just do one thing.
Say thank you.
I spent thirty years trying to bring you back into this dimension and you still haven't thanked me!
You want me to shake your hand?
Say thank you.
Now, see.
Between me and him, I'm not always the bad twin.
I'll grammar Stanley you!
You stuck up son of a gun!
I mean come on!
Kids!
Nice shot, pumpkin.
Wait!
Oh, what do we do?
What do we do?
Oh, I can't believe this.
The kids are gonna die and it's all my fault.
Because I couldn't shake your stupid hand!
Uh, dad was right about me.
I am a screw-up.
How did things get so messed up between us?
Easy.
They're kids.
They don't know any better.
Whoa, where you goin'?
What?
Are you kiddin' me?
Are you honestly telling me there's nothing else we can do?
What if he goes into my mind?
My brain isn't good for anything.
Do you really think he's gonna make good on that deal?
Wait!
I surrender.
It's the only way.
My only condition is that you let my brother and the kids go!
Heh heh!
Do a pretty good impression of my brother, don't I?
Switch clothes and no one can tell us apart.
Welcome to my mind.
Surprised you didn't recognize it.
Oh yeah.
You're going down, Bill.
You're gettin' erased.
Memory gun.
Pretty clever, huh?
It's not like I was using this space for much, anyway.
Hey, look at me.
Turn around and look at me, you one-eyed demon!
You're a real wise-guy, but you made one fatal mistake: you messed with my family.
Heh.
Guess I was good for something after all.
Oh, uh, hey there, kiddo.
What's your name?
Heh.
Who you talkin' to?
Hey, this is a real nice place you got here.
Nope.
But this chair hugs my butt like it remembers.
Hey, why the long faces?
You guys look like it's someone's funeral.
Who's that big guy crying in the corner?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what this is or who you are or-
Gah!
Quit it, Waddles!
I'm trying to remember my life story!
I said get Waddles off of me.
Hey, just cuz I have amnesia, don't go tryin' to give yourself a raise, Soos.
Are you sayin' you need someone to help you sail around the world in the adventure of a lifetime?
You think we'll find treasure?
And babes?
I think the town's had enough mystery for one lifetime.
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Everyone, I have an announcement to make.
Me and my, heh! , nerdy bro over here have some catchin' up to do.
We're gonna be away for a while.
That's why I'm shutting down the Mystery Shack for good.
I'm sorry, Soos.
It's just, there's no one around to run it.
At least, there wouldn't be if I hadn't just found the perfect replacement.
Ladies and gentleman, the Mystery Shack is under new management.
You're Mr Mystery now, Soos.
Try not to burn the place down.
Ah, it's cold out.
I had to.
Agh!
You know what?
Forget it!
I lived with this pig all summer, now your parents are gonna have to.
Hey, bus guy!
This pig is comin' with the kids.
Kids, you knuckleheads were nothin' but a nuisance and I'm glad to be rid of ya.
No refunds!
No refunds!
No refunds!
Hey!
What is this?
Me and Carla baby would cut a rug together at The Juke Joint, our favorite 50's themed, 1970's diner.
Then one day, this new age tree hugger starts playing this transcendental hippie music.
Carla's hotpants turned into bellbottoms before I even knew what happened.
Stockin' meat for the apocalypse, doodly-doo.
We're all gonna die.
Ah, my head!
It hit me right in the head!
