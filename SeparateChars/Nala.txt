Hi Simba.
Simba, I'm kind of in the middle of a Bath.
So where are we going?
It better not be anyplace dumb.
The water hole?
What's so great about the water hole?
[softly] Oh!
[normal] Uh...
mom, can I go with Simba?
[low] So where we really going?
Wow!
[low] Right.
So how we going to ditch the Dodo?
I know...
[inaudible]
Meaning?
Yeah.
It'd be so weird.
Well, he's the future king.
No one saying be there
We lost 'em.
Hey Genius -- it was my idea.
With me!
Pinned ya.
Pinned ya again!
It's really creepy.
We could get in big trouble.
I wonder if it's brains are still in there.
Did we lose 'em?
Simba!
[softly] I thought you were very brave.
Who are you?
Simba?
Whoaaah!
Well how did you...
where did you come from........
it's great to see you...
What do you mean What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
The pleasure is all mine.
Wait till everybody finds out you've been here all this time.
And your mother -- what will she think?
Well of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
Yeah.
Scar told us about the stampede.
What else matters?
You're alive.
And that means... you're the king!
Simba!
Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?
[quietly] It's like you're back from the dead.
You don't know how much this will mean to everyone.
What it means to me.
I've really missed you.
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings The world, for once, in perfect harmony With all its living things
He's holding back, he's hiding But what, I can't decide Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?
It is beautiful.
But I don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you come back to pride rock?
We've really needed you at home.
Yes, we do!
You're the king.
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the pride lands.
Everything's destroyed.
There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
[louder] Why?
What wouldn't I understand?
What?
[Exasperated] Simba!
Because it's your responsibility!
I left to find help!
And I found you.
Don't you understand?
You are our only hope.
What's happened to you?
You're not the Simba I remember.
Just disappointed.
Good.
At least one of us does.
I would if you would just tell me!
Fine!
Hey.
Hey, wake up.
It's okay.
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay.
It's me.
Have you guys seen Simba?
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?
I can't believe it.
He's gone back.
Simba's gone to challenge Scar.
Scar.
No, no, no.
It's his uncle.
Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as king.
Simba!
Wait up!
It's awful, isn't it?
What made you come back?
I will.
Danger?
I laugh in the face of danger.
Hahahaha.
Well we don't.
Simba is the rightful king.
Simba, what is he talking about?
Simba!
Mind your father, Kiara.
Simba.
Who does she remind you of?
Hmm?
She's just like you were when you were young.
You mean the dangers YOU put us in.
She'll be fine.
Zira.
Simba?
You'll do just fine.
Kiara!
You're all right.
Simba?
Simba... you owe him your daughter's life.
Simba?
Did they help?
Oh, Simba... you want so much to walk the path expected of you.
Perhaps Kovu does not.
I can see them down there just as easily as you can.
Get to know them and see.
Vitani!
Hold on, Kiara!
Simba!
Simba -- the river!
Kiara...
Wooaah!
How did you...
Whoah-oh!
I would if you'd just tell me.
Fine!
It's just like the baboon said.
The king has returned.
Ohh.
You want me to go over it again?
Okay, look: Simba's the rightful King.
But after he disappeared, Scar proclaimed himself the King and formed an alliance with the hyenas...
Simba has to go home to challenge his uncle and reclaim his rightful place as King.
Ooooh, don't you get it?
Simba needs us!
Now!
