Scar! ... Drop him.
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
That hairball is my son... and your future king.
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Is that a challenge?
What am I going to do with him?
(Chiding) Zazu!
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Okay, okay.
I'm up.
Look Simba.
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.
Everything.
That's beyond our borders.
You must never go there, Simba.
Oh, there's more to being king than getting your way all the time.
Haha.
Simba.
Everything you see, exists together, in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to understand that balance, and respect all the creatures; from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die, our bodies become the grass.
And the antelope eat the grass.
And so we are all connected in the great circle of life.
Good morning Zazu.
Fire away.
(uninterested) Oh, really?
What are you doing, son?
Let an old pro show you how its done.
Zazu, would you turn around?
(Whispering) Stay low to the ground.
A pouncing lesson.
(still whispering) Try not to make a sound.
Hahaha.
That's very good.
Hahah...
Now, this time...
Zazu!
Take Simba home.
(curtly) No, son.
(half roar) Silence!
If you ever come near my son again...
You deliberately disobeyed me.
(Stern) Let's go home.
(Still Stern) Zazu.
(Stern) Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.
(Calling, still very stern) Simba.
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
You could have been killed.
You deliberately disobeyed me.
And what's worse -- you put Nala in danger!
I'm only brave when I have to be.
Simba... being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
I was today.
Yes... I thought I might lose you.
Mm-hmm.
What?
(gentle laugh) Cause nobody messes with your dad.
Come here, you.
Hmm?
(Gentle laugh) Right.
Simba... let me tell you something that my father told me.
Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
Yes, Simba.
So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you.
And so will I.
Odd.
Simba?
Hold on, Simba!
Scar!
Brother.
Help me!
Aaaaaaahh!
(quietly at first) Simba... Simba.
You have forgotten me.
You have forgotten who you are and so forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than what you have become.
You must take your place in the circle of life.
Remember who you are.
You are my son, and the one true king.
Remember....
Simba!
Simba!
Help me!
Simba!
Well done, my son.
We are one.
