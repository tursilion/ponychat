Let's do this, little dragon!
Yeah!
I know exactly what you mean.
You can't find a cutie mark problem.
I have a cutie mark problem.
It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle.
What?
I see why you guys hang out here!
It's cozy!
Yeah!
Oh, right.
Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!
You mean, not dumbbells?
Yeah!
Oof!
I mean... I hadn't thought of that.
You guys are awesome!
But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?
Yeah!
Wow, you three really have a knack for this!
Cinnamon nuts!
You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
You just do whatever you want to do!
Oh, no!
My nut cart!
Yay!
My nut cart!
[gasps]
I'm late for my other job!
What?
I wear many hats.
Let's do this!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Arts and crafts!
My mom needs new pot holders.
Aw, man!
Hey!
Who left this crystaly dusty stuff here?
Aah!
We're doomed!
Help!
Help!
Heh?
Hmm?
It's just I hate to, see you fight!
Really?
Thanks, guys!
This lump of coal is gonna be cut like a diamond!
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!
I battled the ropes, and I won!
Yeah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Welcome, fillies and gentlecolts, to the Sportacular Spectacular!
I'm Bulk Biceps, the spirit of competition, guiding you through today's Mane Event at the one, the only, Sportacular Spectacular!
The final round features the top six players competing in the joust!
The winning team will be crowned Sportacular Spectacular Champ-taculars!
I've never seen friends compete like this against friends.
You really get what the spirit of competition is all about.
Hey!
That's me!
The spirit of competition!
Being on different teams doesn't mean you're not friends.
By competing your hardest, you push your friends to also play their best.
Congratulations, ponies!
Looks like you're all champ-taculars today!
It's a tie.
You're all champions!
Oh, good!
Just the ponies I was looking for!
I need you!
I've been so inspired by watching you compete here at the Sportacular Spectacular.
You are true sports ponies.
But even better friends.
You've shown me that I need to be a better friend, too.
Because friendship can be hard.
But it's what makes everything worthwhile.
So I thought, Why am I here putting on a perfectly executed one-in-a-lifetime show when I should go make things right with my own pal/rival Hulk Hamstrings?
 Uh, I'm having a flashback.
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
I-I got to give my sash back to you ponies.
You're the spirits of competition now!
Your show.
You earned it.
So you're in charge of the closing ceremonies.
Good luck!
We have our teams facing off in today's Sportacular Spectacular Mane Event!
Pun intended.
It's game time, folks!
