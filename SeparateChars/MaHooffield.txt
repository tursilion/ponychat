Ready...
Aim...
Fire!
We're pumpkinin' our neighbors!
Well, because the McColts are just plain rotten.
Hey, wait a tick.
Who are you two?
You're not spies for the McColts, are ya?
Ma Hooffield.
Pleased to meet ya, but you're wastin' your time.
We don't have a friendship problem.
We have...
a McColt problem.
Oh, they done so many things.
Why, just today, they shot pebbles at our farmhouse an' wrecked it.
See, we're not very good at buildin', so all it took was a little pebble.
But still!
Oh, alright.
One at a time, Greenhoof.
If you smoosh them tomaters in the slingshot, they won't break on the McColts.
Oh, is that what you were hollerin' about?
We thought the McColts rubbed ya the wrong way.
So we tomatered them for ya.
My mistake.
[to Hooffields]
Stop the tomater slingshots!
Reload the tomater slingshots!
We're gonna paint their mountaintop red!
They know what they did.
The satisfaction of winnin'!
Winnin'!
Haven't you been listenin'?
Yeah, yeah.
All of it.
It's Ma Hooffield.
With an apology cake!
Consider it a gesture of goodwill from us to you.
Ready...
aim...
fire!
Yeah!
[laughing]
Wait.
Were you serious about apologizin'?
Why in Equestria would we do that?
We didn't do anythin' wrong!
Not as many as you!
Yeah, we're sorry!
Us too, except we promise not to fight you.
I suppose it doesn't matter who's right.
We're both wrong.
Aw, thanks, princess.
Though I would just like to point out that I was the, uh, first to admit I was wrong.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, all right.
We don't have to speak animal to know what y'all are sayin'.
Truce?
Sure is!
The McColts are gonna help us rebuild our homes!
Good ones this time.
Thanks for teachin' us that friendship is so much better than winnin' a silly argument.
