Ono, how's it looking from up there?
Let's go see what they're up to.
Ono, lead the way!
Vultures!
Leave the baby baboon alone!
All right, little guy.
You're safe.
Fuli!
The baboon!
You're the only one fast enough!
I thought Dad asked you to handle the Buffalo Wallow ceremony.
What are you doing on that island?
Relax, Kiara.
We'll get you off that island.
We need to get him home.
His family probably lives in the big baboon tree in Nyani Grove.
It's not far.
So it shouldn't take you too long to get him home.
We can manage until you get back.
Besides, I think that baby baboon kinda likes you.
Thanks, Fuli.
Unless the Roar destroys the island.
But there might be another way to get them off the island.
We can make a bridge!
So Kiara tried to use a boulder as a stepping stone?
Sounds like a good plan.
They were both good plans.
Just not good enough.
Hmm, I wonder... If we put both plans together...
Bunga, Beshte, help me move that big boulder.
Ono, fly over and get Kiara, Tiifu, and Zuri.
Bring them to that tree.
We're all set with the boulder!
You ready to knock over that tree?
Nothing's ever simple when it comes to Fuli and baboons.
Smell that, Fuli?
Then, we need to move.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Bunga, you and Ono, go help Hamu.
Fuli, Beshte, let's go help the rest of the zebras.
Give it up, Reirei!
You're the last one standing.
Well, not anymore you're not.
Don't worry, Reirei.
You'll be safe from these vicious zebras once you're back in the Outlands where you belong.
Good job, everyone!
Muhimu, what's wrong?
What do you think, Bunga?
You okay keeping an eye on Hamu for a little while?
What is it Ono?
Ono, it's alright.
Bunga will do great with Hamu.
You're right, Ono.
We should practice what we do.
Come on.
You see that rock up there?
Let's pretend it's a trapped animal.
Who wants to try to get it down?
Give it a try.
Ono, are you okay?
Wait, Beshte!
Okay.
Maybe that's enough climbing practice for now.
Guys, it never hurts to try new things.
Hey, let's go see how he's doing with Hamu at Hakuna Matata Falls.
You hear that?
Till the Pride Lands' end,
Ono, what did you see?
What are you up to, Goigoi?
Sure.
But first, you tell us where Reirei and the rest of your family are.
Just give it up, Goigoi.
Heyvi kabisa!
We've gotta help Bunga and Hamu.
Bunga, Hamu, are you all right?
I think we can help you, Reirei.
As long as you promise not to come after anymore Pride Lands kids again.
You and the kids did a great job, Bunga.
It'll be okay,as long as we can keep them from fighting over it.
Beshte!
Ono!
Get the herds somewhere safe!
Bunga, you can stop.
Shujaa seems... friendly.
It's okay, Beshte.
Show him.
King Sokwe was right.
We can definitely use your help.
Not for long.
Come on, Shujaa!
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
It was, but... look!
Shujaa did great!
We just might have a little clean-up to do.
Well, they kinda did.
Maybe you should just let us handle the cleanup.
Where?
ONO: On the Savannah, just beyond Nyani Grove!
Then we'll go through the Grove and cut 'em off!
Till the Pride Lands end...  Lion Guard Defend!
How we doin', Ono?
Shujaa, wait!
Baboons...
Bunga, Ono, you're with me!
You won't need to.
Just stay behind me.
Thanks, Shujaa.
So that was the good news.
And then there's the bad news.
Nyani Grove is a mess.
You do help, Shujaa.
And we're really grateful.
It's just, sometimes... We need you on fire breaks!
I'm not gonna lose another part of the Pride Lands!
Can't!
It'd spread the fire everywhere.
We're not strong enough to move him.
Ono, get Shujaa!
Tell him Beshte's hurt, and we need him, now!
You did great, Shujaa.
We couldn't have saved Big Springs without you.
And a great ally.
It's a deal.
Hey, Beshte!
We heard an animal shouting for help.
Basi, you probably shouldn't be walking on that leg.
Beshte, you're the strongest in the Pride Lands.
We all believe in you.
All right!
Come on, Bunga.
Something tells me we'd only slow Beshte down.
We'll help your dad get back to solid ground so he can rest.
Happy to help.
They'll be completely underwater.
We need to get that herd to higher ground.
Come on, Lion Guard.
Let's go help those antelope!
Till the Pride Lands end...  Lion Guard Defend!
Antelopes, listen up!
You need to follow us to higher... ground.
Let's go!
I know you're tired and hungry.
But if you follow us to higher ground, there'll be plenty to eat.
And you won't be standing around in water.
Ono, report.
Back!
Everyone back!
Anyone hurt?
Ono, how's the herd?
Is there another way around?
I could, if the antelopes weren't on the other side of it.
But I can use the Roar from that side of the rock!
Come on!
(SIGHS) Come on, everybody.
(ROARS) Come on.
Let's get you to the flood plains.
This way.
Almost there.
We just have to take the hippo lanes across the flood plains.
Ono?
What's going on?
Not if we can help it.
Bunga, Fuli, you two stay here.
Don't let anyone else in.
Ono, you're with me.
(GRUNTS) You okay?
Now where's your mother?
No, Ono!
Stay with this little guy.
Guide him back to safety.
Don't worry.
I'll find your mother.
I'm on my way!
What's going on?
Finally, something's gone right today!
You guys did a good job.
We all want to hear the story, Rafiki.
Whoever you are, come out and show yourself!
You heard me!
Come out!
(CHUCKLES) Relax.
It's just a story.
Thanks for the story, Rafiki.
Eight legs?
Each one bigger than the last?
Does that sound real, guys?
Bunga, it's only the wind.
If you guys are that worried, maybe you should all stay together tonight.
You'll feel safer.
What?
What's wrong?
The Zimwi?
That's impossible.
The Zimwi doesn't exist.
It's just a story!
You must've seen some other animal.
For the last time, there's no such thing as a Zimwi.
You've both seen the Zimwi?
More or less?
Wait!
If the ox got eaten, how did he tell anyone else the story?
Maybe there's nothing he can do, but we're the Lion Guard.
We'll find whatever you saw.
And if it really is the Zimwi, we'll run it out of the Pride Lands!
Let's go.
Till the Pride Lands end...  Lion Guard Defend!
Even if we're just defending everyone from Rafiki's silly story.
(CHUCKLES) Come on, Bunga.
You really think there's a creature out here that's as tall as two giraffes with big spikes, and teeth sharper than a crocodile?
Mmm, no.
We'll find whatever it is those animals saw, and then you'll see it's not a Zimwi.
It's nothing!
Bunga!
Enough!
Don't worry, okay?
We're not even sure the Zimwi's real.
But they hadn't even heard of the Zimwi til you told them about it.
(SIGHS) Okay, Bunga.
But the next animal we run into, try not to mention the Zimwi.
Hey there, it's okay.
It's okay, calm down.
What's got you all upset?
Right!
Thank you!
Yeah.
Come on, everybody.
Just an owl, guys.
(SIGHS) See?
Just Beshte.
No Zimwi.
Huh?
Anyone else feel... Like we're being watched.
Shh.
Over there.
In the bushes.
All right, team, let's move in.
Ono, keep an eye out overhead.
(GASPS)
Gazelles?
Listen.
I don't think the Zimwi's really real.
They heard it from you!
Relax.
The Zimwi's just a story.
Uh, maybe?
Whatever it is, it's on the move.
Come on, Lion Guard, let's go.
This ravine's a dead end so it's got nowhere to run.
Anyone see anything?
Look out!
Lion Guard!
We've gotta get these gazelles under control!
We get them out in the open.
That way they can't hurt themselves!
Beshte, flatten those bushes!
Make an opening to the clearing.
Let's round them up.
This way.
They should wear themselves out in a little bit.
Because we scared them.
(SIGHS) While we were running away.
Nothing to be sorry about.
I ran away, too.
(SIGHS) I know.
All this time, I wasn't afraid of the Zimwi because I thought it wasn't real.
But as soon as I thought it was, I ran away.
Listen.
It's okay to be scared.
But we're the Lion Guard, and we can't run away.
Okay, time to face the Zimwi!
Till the Pride Lands end...  Lion Guard Defend!
You don't scare us, Zimwi!
What in the Pride Lands?
Lion Guard!
Get it!
Looks like it.
So, did you two hear something scary and think it was the Zimwi?
Don't feel bad, Beshte.
I think everyone was so spooked by Rafiki's story, they were ready to believe anything.
Scared of this?
Beshte, last night you faced the Zimwi!
You didn't know that.
And you charged in anyway.
And if you can do that, I think you can bellow in front of a couple of hippos.
The first song's the best part!
Oh, yeah.
Anyone hurt?
Dad?
I'm gonna have to miss the elephants' rainy season concert.
Right.
Let's go, Ono.
Say hi to Ma Tembo and the elephants for me!
Dad?
Is he all right?
Thanks, Fuli.
Ono, lead the way!
Mom, Mom!
Is Dad okay?
Bunga!
Wait!
Bunga?
Dad?
You two all right?
What happened, Dad?
How'd you get down there?
Don't worry, Dad.
We'll find a way to get both of you outta there.
How hard can it be?
Ono, fly down and take a look.
Ono, report!
Any roots they can grab hold of?
Rocks they can climb?
Anything?
Oh... Okay, Ono.
Okay.
Everyone needs to stay back.
Yeah.
It's bad enough Dad and Bunga are stuck down there.
Doesn't sound like Bunga and Dad are getting along, does it?
What do you mean?
Trying?
I know Bunga can be kind of stubborn, but he's my best friend.
And Dad... Climbing trees.
Hmm.
I have an idea.
Lion Guard, you're with me.
Be right back, Mom!
Dad, Bunga.
We're gonna tip this tree down into the hole.
Then you can just climb up.
That didn't work as well as I thought it would.
The entrance isn't too far from here.
Dad, if you and Bunga go through the tunnel, I'll take the Guard into the Caverns.
With any luck, we'll meet you in the middle!
Be careful!
Lion Guard, let's head to Nandembo Caverns.
Hmm.
But we do know someone who is an expert at tunnels!
Meet us at the Caverns!
I thought Timon could help.
Meerkats are supposed to be great in tunnels.
Dad?
Bunga?
Dad!
Bunga!
I don't believe it.
Dad, Bunga?
It means no worries
Baboons, you gotta come down.
It's not safe up there.
Stay on this side of the tree!
I got to get him out of that tree.
Bunga, climb up there and scare those baboons down.
I got you.
Okay, everyone take a breather.
You've earned it.
There you go, little guy.
(CHUCKLES) You're welcome.
Hevi kabisa!
Storm's caused so much destruction.
I was thinking.
The rains cause so many problems for the Pride Lands.
I guess.
Yes, Grandpa
Oh, no.
Guys, get up!
Break's over!
Ono!
Take a look!
(GRUNTS) That last rainstorm's still causing trouble.
Lion Guard!
We need to do something before all that water floods the valley.
I don't know, Bunga.
The easy solution's not always the best solution.
Uh-oh.
Now look at it.
What do we do about that?
Hey, Bunga!
Wait up!
Bunga!
Bunga, wait up!
Oh, we forgot to flip the turtles.
Sorry about that.
Argh.
The porcupine brothers.
Though that'd be easier if we had Bunga to help.
Ono, go find Bunga.
(HUMMING)
There you go, you guys.
See you next time.
Okay, who wants to crawl in and make sure Ushari and the cobras aren't stuck in the mud?
Yeah, but he's... Hevi kabisa!
What is all this?
See who?
Hey!
Bunga!
Bunga, what's going on?
I guess.
Bunga, you already help the Pride Lands.
You're on the Lion Guard.
You're the Pride Lands' bravest!
Bunga... 
But I just got a bad feeling about all this.
Hevi kabisa!
And I don't think that one likes it very much.
Come on.
Are you okay?
Don't say it.
Bushbucks!
Stop!
These flowers will make you sick.
I know what you're thinking.
Hang on!
We'll help you out.
Fuli, pick a horn.
Beshte, you say when.
How'd you get trapped down there?
Okay, go ahead and say it.
Yeah.
We've got to tell him to stop.
Oh, come on.
Bunga, what are you doing?
Bunga, you've got to stop this.
We've got enough to do trying to deal with the rainstorm.
Your bad advice is making things worse.
We've gotta move those animals to safety.
Lion Guard, follow me!
Split up!
Everyone, follow me!
Now!
Hurry!
Into the canyon!
Ono!
Which way?
This way, everybody!
To the left!
(GASPS)
Right.
But it's not exactly quick and easy.
Now, everyone!
Get behind me!
(ROARING)
Me, too.
(GROWLS) Back off!
Your tree?
No way!
You can't tell me what to do.
Her?
Queen?
Dad, what's going on?
He was a wise elephant.
Wasn't he?
Kiara's only queen while my mom and dad are away.
Anybody see Ono?
It's not like him to be late for morning patrol.
What?
Why is he going to Pride Rock?
What are you doing?
We've got a patrol.
Queen Kiara?
Kiara, what was so important you had to take Ono away from our patrol?
Yeah, okay.
But he's still part of the Lion Guard.
You should have asked me first.
Yeah.
Great job, Ono.
(GROANS)
Sounds like everything is okay.
So can I have Ono back for the Guard's morning patrol now?
I didn't think of that.
Okay.
Lion Guard, let's move out.
Huh?
I guess we could, but...
(GROANS) Come on, guys.
Did I just get an order from my sister?
(GROANS) No.
Beehives in the path.
Just like you said, Ono.
Where are the elands?
Okay.
When they get here, we'll move them off the path and across the fields far away from the bees.
Yeah.
Seems kind of silly.
Moving a whole herd of elands just to avoid a few little bees?
(GROANS) Yeah, Queen Kiara's decree.
She's only been queen for a day.
I've been leading the Lion Guard for a lot longer than that.
Kiara can tell me to do something.
But she can't tell me how to do it.
I say we move the bees.
Don't worry about the elands!
Hevi kabisa!
Incoming!
There may have been a small problem with the bees and the elands.
It wasn't a total disaster.
Well, we did manage to round up the elands... eventually.
Next time?
It's pretty hard to forget.
Kiara!
You have to know it's a trap!
Kiara, you can't trust Mzingo.
Or Janja!
But this is completely different.
You don't know Janja like I do.
I've had to run him off so many times.
Kiara!
You're not really queen.
(SIGHS) If you're serious about this, you're on your own.
I can't believe it.
What is she thinking?
(SIGHS) It's Kiara, Grandfather.
She doesn't know what she's getting herself into.
Even if she's wrong?
Hmm.
Thank you, Grandfather.
(SIGHS) I better go talk to her.
And you let her go alone?
Ugh!
Some advisors you two are!
Lion Guard!
Kiara's in trouble!
Till the Pride Lands' end...  Lion Guard Defend!
Get away from the queen!
Of course!
Oh, we can fight, all right.
Till the Pride Lands' end...  Lion Guard Defend!
I should've listened to you about the bees.
Welcome back!
Yeah, but it wasn't anything Kiara couldn't handle.
Fuli, you and Bunga go help the pangolins!
Ono, show 'em the way!
Come on, Beshte.
We need to save those giraffes!
Back off, Janja!
It might hurt Twiga and Juhudi.
It's a good thing.
They had us way outnumbered.
You two okay?
Let's make sure Janja and his clan are really heading back to the Outlands first.
Yeah.
And let's hope it never happens again.
It split us up.
And when we split up, we're weaker.
Twiga and Juhudi saved themselves.
And then the hyenas just... left.
Then that means the attacks weren't a coincidence!
They must be working together!
To split us up!
That way, they both had us outnumbered!
And if they did it once, they might do it again.
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
With a little help, that's how!
How about me, Tamaa?
Can you still sound like me?
I'm glad to hear you kept your promise, Tamaa.
But we're not here to check up on you.
We need your help.
No, that's not it.
This is something serious.
Remember how you scared the hyenas by imitating our voices?
Yeah.
Well, we want you to do it again.
Not exactly.
You're going to imitate our voices, but we're not going to be there.
I think a clever bird like you should be able to handle himself.
What about the hyenas?
I still don't think so.
Ono, keep an eye out for Janja.
In the meantime, we'll take on Reirei.
Tamaa, you're with us.
There they are, come on.
Rafiki?
Heyvi kabisa!
We have to save Rafiki!
Tamaa, we're gonna need your help after all.
Just keep the jackals confused till we get back!
Stay out of sight and do your stuff!
Let's go.
'Til the Pride Lands end...  Lion Guard Defend!
Not for long!
What in the Pride Lands?
Are you okay?
Don't worry, Tamaa.
You did what you could.
Now try to stay above the fight so you won't get hurt!
Lion Guard, with me!
Rafiki?
You probably wanna stop meditating now.
I'm with you, Bunga.
The hard way.
Everyone.
Till the Pride Lands end.
(GROWLS)
Good!
Now get out of the Pride Lands!
I wish I knew.
You have?
What is it?
What does it mean?
Good idea, Rafiki.
Let's hope it is just a coincidence.
We're almost there.
Anga said the next Moja Kwa Moja stone is just over this hill.
Anga, what's making that sound?
Anga, please tell me the next Moja Kwa Moja stone isn't in the middle of the ocean.
Great.
It's not that far.
Let's go.
Yeah.
And thank you, for helping Bunga.
But we've gotta go now.
Anga?
Ono?
You know where to go from here?
Then let's go.
Well then we'll need to get there quick.
Come on til the Pride Lands end.
I'm sure that's part of Janja's plan, Fuli.
Kabisa!
Whoa!
Good eyes, Ono!
Keep 'em peeled for Janja and his clan!
Janja!
(BITES) I thought I told you to stay out of the Pride Lands!
See ya, hyena.
Keep going, Janja!
All the way back to the Outlands!
Nice job, everyone.
Follow them, Ono.
Make sure they leave the Pride Lands.
Don't worry, Ono.
We'll get you to Rafiki.
He'll know what to do.
Rafiki!
Yeah.
Me, too.
Don't worry, Ono.
The Guard can get by for a couple days without you.
You need to rest and get better.
Amazing.
What do you think, Ono?
Ono!
You should be taking it easy!
Ono, I really think you should take a break.
Easy, Bunga.
You just need to get better, Ono.
You'll be back on duty in no time.
But for now, let's get you back to the lair.
How does it look?
Like this?
Bunga, that tickles.
Whoa!
Bunga!
(LAUGHS) Sorry, Rafiki.
So what's the news, Beshte?
And what was it, Beshte?
Janja?
Back in the Pride Lands?
He wouldn't come back unless he was planning something.
That's it!
Janja's planning to attack the zebras!
Come on, we have to get to Chakula Plains!
Till the Pride Lands' end...  Lion Guard Defend!
Hurry!
This way!
This is the fastest way to the zebras!
Come on!
Quick!
We'll have to take the long way round!
Take cover.
Everyone okay?
Right.
Thanks, Beshte.
Heyvi kabisa!
Don't even try it, Janja!
Worth a try.
Go for it, Beshte.
Beshte!
Watch out!
Beshte, you okay?
It doesn't matter.
You flew here.
And that gives me an idea.
Don't worry.
I'm sure Ono can do it.
Thanks, Ono.
Everyone, get behind me.
Good job, Ono.
We couldn't have done it without you.
You were always on the team, Ono.
It's perfect, Rafiki.
What do you think, Ono?
Beshte!
Ono!
Bunga!
Take care of the fire!
Fuli, we'll get the giraffes to safety!
Giraffes this way!
Okay, giraffes.
You're good to go.
Scar's gotta be behind all this fire falling from the sky.
Ono?
Any ideas?
And we're back on fire patrol!
Chakula Plains!
Fast!
It's okay, Ono I know you did your best
You think she'd help us?
Well, let's go ask her!
Hevi Kabisa!
Everyone duck!
So Anga.
We were hoping you can help us.
We need someone who can fly really really high Like you.
Then we better start now.
Ono and Anga find out where those fire sticks are coming from we'll keep the fires.
Everybody calm down!
Who saw the hyenas?
Where are they?
Hyenas!
We know you're in there!
Lion Guard, spread out!
You're surrounded, hyenas!
Come on out!
(SIGHS) Why were you trying to scare everybody?
Are you Mtoto?
Ono, want to give the all clear?
So you guys were pretending to be the Lion Guard?
Well, little Lion Guard, this isn't the best time to pretend to be hyenas.
So you can see why everyone got so upset.
Sounds like fun.
But with hyenas on the loose, we need to stay sharp.
Lion Guard!
Time for some training.
We need to be ready to chase down Janja wherever we find him.
Okay.
Well, we were just about to run an obstacle course.
Sure, I guess.
Stick with him, Beshte.
Ono, keep an eye out for hyenas while we're running this one.
Everybody follow me!
Boulder jump!
You're gonna love this, Fuli.
(CHUCKLES) You'll do anything to stay dry, won't you?
Yeah, why don't we try something totally different.
Hmm, let's run a stealth surround drill.
Okay, I'll go to the other side of that big rock pile.
The rest of you try to sneak up, without me seeing or hearing you.
Ono?
Keep watch for hyenas while we're running this one?
You know the drill.
Wait till I'm out of sight.
Then try to surround me.
(LAUGHS) Got me.
You're good, Fuli.
(CHUCKLES) Bunga, what happened to sneaking up on me?
So, that just leaves Beshte.
Mtoto, are you okay?
We're just glad you're not hurt, Mtoto.
But I think it's time for you to head home.
Great job on the obstacle course!
Now time for some speed training!
As long as you're both faster than the hyenas, I'm good.
Speaking of hyenas... Ono, could you take another look around?
Thanks!
Oh, and maybe look for Beshte while you're up there?
I mean, how long can it take to walk a little elephant home?
Well?
Anything?
Hmm.
It's not like Beshte to wander off when we're on alert.
Something's wrong.
C'mon.
We've gotta find him.
I don't see Beshte anywhere.
Have you guys seen Beshte?
Ono, we have to find them!
Wrong, Janja!
He brought all his friends!
Ono, you're with me!
Till the Pride Lands end,
I'm just sorry we couldn't find you sooner!
You kids had quite an adventure today.
And you know what?
I think you've all earned the Mark of the Guard.
Come on, everyone!
Keep going.
Sure, just don’t get in my way.
You guys who said anything about a break?
We can rest once we get to the Tree of Life.
We're so close right now.
Okay fine.
I'm fine I'll be better once we get to the Tree of Life.
Come on everyone let's go.
What is it?
Beshte.
You guys?
Alright he's safe now so let's.
Alright fine Anga.
Then we've really gotta get to the Tree of Life.
No kidding from now on let's not waste anymore of our time helping animals who don't need help.
What's that?
Hey watch it will ya?
Peacocks we're trying to get through here.
We don't have time for this coming through Lion Guard follow me.
You watch where you're going.
What?
He didn't watch where he was going.
The peacocks think that they own the place
If we keep getting slowed down now we'll never get to the Tree of Life.
Oh no not again.
Beshte we don't have time for new friends.
I wasn't talking to you.
Beshte we can't stop every time you see a new animal.
You see?
That's the problem you're slowing us down stop being nice.
Forget it Makini the tuliza's not working anymore.
Am I?
All I want to do is get to the Tree of Life but everyone keeps slowing me down.
It feels like I'm dragging you along.
I am not being mean.
What take over?
I am the leader of the Guard Fuli and I am not going to let that happen.
What's just like Rafiki said?
Yeah but.
What I have?
You really think I'm evil like him?
You guys, do you all think I'm turning evil like Scar?
I AM NOT EVIL!
(growls) Or maybe I am.
What if I really am turning evil?
Just like Scar did.
I should talk to Grandfather Mufasa oh right my scar I can't let Grandfather see me like this.
I look just like Scar.
No you're wrong Scar.
We're not the same I might look like you but I'll never act like you.
Except, I guess, I kinda have been acting mean today.
(SIGHS) I got to go apologize.
Woah!
Anga.
(EXCLAIMS) Am I glad to see you.
Yes, that'd be great.
Maybe I can reach you.
(EXCLAIMS)
Thanks, Anga.
Just, uh, don't be too long.
Lion Guard!
Ono's found dry ground.
We gotta round up the buffalo and guide them over there fast!
Beshte!
Bunga!
That last one's yours!
Bunga, are you okay?
I have a better idea.
We'll take him to Rafiki.
Ono, have Timon and Pumbaa meet us at Rafiki's tree.
Hang in there, Bunga.
Rafiki will know what to do.
Timon, Pumbaa, calm down.
Rafiki, Bunga was bitten by a poisonous snake.
Bunga!
Bunga!
Easy, Fuli.
Bunga, we just thought you were really hurt.
Thanks, Pumbaa.
Sounds great, but I have to meet my family for dinner.
We need to be sure Fuli knows we're here for her.
From now on, if any of us sees Fuli all alone, we'll invite her to join us in whatever we're doing.
Wow.
I guess you can do that with thick skin like yours.
There she is!
Hey!
Sorry about the gazelle.
But if you're up for a hunt, you could hunt with me and my family.
Hakuna Matata!
You in, Bunga?
Okay.
See you later.
Tiifu and Zuri?
Sure.
They're my sister's best friends.
They're like family.
You got to hang out with us.
Isn't that better than hunting alone?
We just thought you'd be happier with company.
Not really.
Fuli!
(SIGHS) Sorry.
Hey, guys, have you seen Fuli?
I asked her to hunt with my family, too.
But it didn't go so well.
Yeah.
She said she likes it.
Guess we were being better friends when we just let Fuli be Fuli.
Lead the way, Ono.
Any sign of Fuli?
Till the Pride Land's end... Lion Guard Defend!
Beshte!
The dead tree!
We're the Lion Guard.
We come through for each other.
Always.
Let's go!
But if you'd rather be alone, Fuli, that's okay too.
You do?
After last night's big storm, I'm glad the mud is our only problem.
Nice try, Janja.
We both know this is the Pride Lands.
And you don't belong here.
The mud might slow down the wildebeests.
But I don't think it's going to slow you down.
(ROARING)
Because we gotta make sure all the trails in the Pride Lands are safe after the big rainstorm.
Uh-oh.
And that includes this one!
Mudslide!
Everyone!
Run for it!
So we'll need to clear it and make it safe again.
Ono, Bunga.
Keep everyone off this trail until we're finished.
Fuli, Beshte.
You're with me.
We have to get all these trees and boulders off this trail.
Great job, Beshte.
Looks like the trail's safe to use again.
What'd you see, Ono?
Let's go!
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Beshte, block their path.
Bunga, you help the smaller one.
Fuli, we'll grab the big one.
That was close.
Are you two all right?
What?
You two?
If you're here, then Janja's here, too.
Ono?
Well, they can't stay here.
You two have to go back to the Outlands.
But what if they chase after the herds like Janja always does?
Hmm.
Maybe you're right, Ono.
And I guess letting them stay would be the nice thing to do.
Okay.
As long as you two don't cause any trouble, you can stay in the Pride Lands.
Don't make us regret it.
Let's get back to our patrol.
Ono, check in on them every once in a while.
I still think this might be one of Janja's plans.
Problem, Ono?
Lead the way, Ono!
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Ono, did you see what made them run?
(SNIFFING) Doesn't matter.
I think I know.
Come on!
We gotta catch that herd and calm 'em down!
Yeah.
It's all our fault.
We didn't start the stampede.
But we let Cheezi and Chungu stay in the Pride Lands.
Either them or Janja.
I caught the scent of hyenas earlier.
Ono, find Cheezi and Chungu and lead us to 'em.
Let's ask 'em.
Hey!
Okay, you two.
Why'd you start that stampede?
I knew it!
Come on!
Why'd you scare off the antelopes, Janja?
What's your plan?
Lion Guard!
Let's go!
And you must be Janja's new crew.
You are pretty smart.
(ROARING)
I wish.
But we gotta get him off the ledge and out of the Pride Lands.
Janja?
Cheezi?
Chungu?
Okay, then.
It's time for you to go home.
It is.
I have a duty to the Pride Lands.
My whole family is there.
But I still have more to learn about the Roar.
And the Night Pride could use our help.
And Queen Rani, wants me to stay there.
What do I want?
The path that's right for me.
Thank you, Grandfather.
Rani.
Uh, hi.
You mean about never being welcome at the Tree of Life?
Yeah, it's true.
I know.
The Lion Guard and the Night Pride work really well together.
Yeah, we do.
Why do I start smilin' when I hear your name?
Still there's something deeper
Seems like I have grown up so much since I met you
We had some great adventures
Shame to think it's ending
You have the patience I always wish I had
'Cause when I'm with you, it's clear
If I've learned anything about you, Rani, it's that you don't need my help.
You don't need anyone's help.
You're a great leader, Rani.
Uh, hey, Bunga.
What's going on?
Well, there's peace in the Pride Lands.
The Night Pride could use our help.
And Rani has become a good friend.
Jasiri?
Jasiri?
Janja?
What you doing here?
My dad banished them for betraying the Pride Lands.
It's up to the Lion Guard to stop Zira and her pride.
As long as we have the Mark of the Guard we have a duty to defend the Pride Lands.
Yes.
And we have to go now.
I understand.
I'm sure you'll be a great Royal Mjuzi, Makini.
I know.
Thank you, Queen Rani.
Come on, Lion Guard, time to go.
Til' the Pride Lands' end... Lion Guard Defend!
Thanks for coming to get us, Jasiri.
Ono you still rememeber all of the moja kwa moja stones on Rafiki's map?
We'll need to move fast.
It'll take us a long time to go around that lake.
Wait, you know a faster way to get to the Pride Lands?
Before we decide anything, I want to take a look and see.
Azaad, show us the way.
If this is the fastest way, then this is the way we're going.
Get behind me.
We need to get back to the Pride Lands as fast as we can.
We just need to get across this ravine?
That's all I needed to hear.
(LAUGHS)Okay, Bunga, you first.
So, who's next?
Fuli?
Azaad?
Like this.
Okay, Azaad.
We're across.
Now which way do we go?
Yeah.
Really good friends.
Oh, I think I can get us there way before sunset!
First, we need to get this dead tree into the riverbed.
Don't worry, Beshte.
I got it.
Guess they kind of do.
Okay, now, we're going to ride that tree down the river.
Not yet.
Hope you two don't mind getting wet.
Now, everyone hop on the tree and hold on tight.
We're gonna ride the tree down the river.
Here comes the water.
Everybody, get on!
Hang on tight, everyone.
Looks like this is as far as we go.
What do you think, Azaad?
Fast enough for you?
Great.
Now, let's keep going.
I think I can find us another way.
Or make one.
Probably.
Fuli, Zira and her lionessess may have already attacked.
We need to get to the Pride Lands as fast as we can.
So, stand back.
Heyvi kabisa.
Everyone, stay behind me.
I can handle this.
Not sure.
But I don't think I can...Uh-oh (ROARS)
(ROARING) Ono, is any luck?
(PANTING) Can't keep it up much longer.
(EXHALES)Thanks, everyone.
I thought I could solve all of our problems myself, but I was wrong.
Nothing can replace the Lion Guard working together as a team. Not even the Roar.
We make a great team. All of us.
Guess we need to take the long way around after all.
Yes.
The Pride Lands.
But we can't stop now.
We need to find Zira and stop her.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
They're still not slowing down.
Great idea, Ono!
Let's follow Ono's plan!
Fuli, you take the lead!
So is everyone calmed down?
Great!
Then you're good to go home.
Slowly this time, okay?
Makuu?
I thought you'd be sleeping through the dry season with the rest of the crocodiles.
I'm so sorry, Makuu.
I forgot your float was sleeping in that cave.
Oh, no, you don't!
We'll go to my dad.
Yeah.
My dad.
He makes sure everyone has enough water in the dry season.
I know he'll take care of you and your float, Makuu.
Don't worry, Ono.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I hope.
Ono!
Come over here.
Dad?
What if Ono looks out over the Pride Lands to see which watering hole is least crowded?
Then maybe that one can go to the crocodiles.
We need to split up to gather them all.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Stop right there, Kiburi!
This watering hole is not your place!
Leave the impalas alone!
Sure, Dad.
My dad says there's enough water and fish to last you the whole dry season.
A Mashindano?
Yeah.
Makuu's become a good leader.
Three crocodiles?
It doesn't make sense.
Keep an eye on 'em.
Fuli, Beshte, and Bunga.
Something's up with the crocs, but I'm not sure what.
We'll need to be careful.
There's a lot of animals here.
We don't want to scare them and start a stampede.
Come on!
My dad?
Hevyi kabisa!
Let's go!
If you're smart, you'll stop right now.
(GROWLS)
Nothing now, Dad.
And use the Mashindano for cover.
But Ono saw it coming.
The Lion Guard!
That's how!
Ono, you really don't have to do this.
I told Makuu how your keenest of sight foiled Kiburi's plan.
If you ask me, it's a crocodile way I could get used to!
Too late and too slow!
Oof!
(CHUCKLES) Hey!
The baobab fruit's mine!
Jasiri?
What are you doing in the Pride Lands?
Is it Janja and his hyenas?
In the Outlands?
But there shouldn't be any lions in the Outlands.
Okay.
Well, I'd be happy to talk to them, Jasiri.
Maybe they're lost or something.
Bunga, go back to the Lair.
Let the rest of the Guard know I'm going to the Outlands with Jasiri.
No need.
I should be right back.
These are lions after all.
It's probably just a misunderstanding.
Lead the way, Jasiri.
Why wouldn't I?
We've helped each other before.
They probably don't realize there are good hyenas in the Outlands.
I had that problem at first, too.
Nice to meet you, Madoa.
Hey there, little guys!
Don't be afraid of me.
Well, that's why I'm here.
I don't know why those lions are in the Outlands.
But I'm sure I can clear things up.
Then there's no time to lose.
Let's go, Jasiri!
Lions are pretty reasonable.
Once we get to the watering hole, I'm sure we can work things... Hey!
Back off!
Name's Kion.
Who are you?
A friend of yours?
What are you two lions doing in the Outlands?
Why aren't you in the Pride Lands?
Why wouldn't you be?
I'm sure my dad would welcome you there.
I don't see why not.
Especially if you give Jasiri's family their watering hole back.
You know Kiara?
The name's Kion.
C'mon, Jasiri.
You'll see.
This whole watering hole thing's gotta be a misunderstanding.
But I am.
Now, what are you doing in the Outlands?
And why have you taken over Jasiri's watering hole?
Yeah.
How do you know?
Roar at the cloud?
I don't see how roaring at a cloud is gonna do that.
Well, I guess it won't hurt to try.
(ROARS) Whoa!
I didn't.
Zira.
How did you know the Roar could do that?
I know.
But she knows more about the Roar than I do!
Besides, maybe I can get her to agree to share the watering hole.
Okay, Zira.
Let's talk.
You are?
Stay noble and grand
We must protect the land
Friendships and kindness
Will always find us
Zira.
You and I have different ideas about how lions should act.
Okay, Zira.
We're alone.
Tell me about the Roar.
I'm on the side of the Circle of Life.
And the animals who respect it.
Zira?
What's going on?
Jasiri was right.
She knew not to trust you.
Now tell your lionesses to back down.
You know I have the Roar.
And you know what it can do.
You're talking about Scar!
Scar was never the true King!
Keeping me here doesn't make any sense.
I just want you lions to share the watering hole!
I don't think I want to wait around that long.
Zira?
I do have something to say.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
I... I can't.
That's how Scar lost the Roar.
He used it against lions.
Of course.
You're right!
Oh, I've listened to you, Zira.
Now, you listen to me.
As long as I'm around, you're not welcome in the Pride Lands.
Or the Outlands!
(ROARS)
And now?
Thanks.
Hey, little ones!
I'm not so scary now, huh?
I'm glad you guys get to relax.
That's better.
Right.
Long way to go.
Rani.
You here for Ono's healing, too?
What?
Ullu?
What's going on?
Right.
Let's go.
Ono?
What do you mean?
Smart.
Great insight, Ono.
Ullu!
Go tell Rani.
Granny Ginterbong is just a decoy.
Lion Guard, you’re with me!
Stop right there, Makucha!
Well, here's my idea.
Get out!
Rani's right, Ono.
Even if you're not the keenest of sight, you are the keenest of insight.
And you'll always be part of the Lion Guard, no matter what.
Leave those cubs alone, Chuluun!
Right.
Guys?
(growls) Makucha!
Go ahead, Rani.
Me and the Lion Guard will stay with Varya and her cubs.
Thanks, Fuli.
How is she?
Yes, Queen Janna.
I'm here.
Me, too.
Thank you, Your Majesty, for everything.
I'm so sorry, Rani.
Are you okay?
When I first got the Roar, I didn't think I could be leader of the Lion Guard.
Yeah.
But then I found the strength I needed inside me.
You will too.
My grandfather Mufasa helped me learn that.
(points to his scar) Not since I got this.
It makes me look like Scar, an evil lion who betrayed Mufasa and took over the Pride Lands.
Then you understand why I can't face my grandfather, not until my scar is healed.
Well you see a random hyena I first met sang me a song about it.
I'm glad she did, too.
Yeah, I might.
Thanks, Rani.
Queen Janna isn't the only one to know just what to say.
You're a lot like her.
Grandfather Mufasa?
No, Grandfather.
I didn't forget about you.
It's just... I was afarid to face you.
I've got this scar now.
And I was worried that I might turn evil, like Scar.
Espeically since I ketp losing my temper and losing control of the Roar on our way to the Tree of Life.
Thank you, Grandfather.
That makes me feel better.
I'm sorry I stayed away.
I promise I won't be afarid to talk to you again.
I missed you too.
Long live the Queen!
Everywhere we go.
What's going on around here?
Beshte's right.
It's something about Tuliza.
No more joking around okay, Bunga?
We don't have time for jokes.
We gotta keep going.
Okay.
Yes.
Thanks, Makini.
Okay, now let's go.
You sure you put it on the log?
Maybe.
Anga, see if you can spot porcupines with Makini's staff.
Nothing much, Any sign of the staff theives?
What do you think, Fuli?
Good idea, Beshte.
Let's go ask around.
A gibbon said you could help us.
We're looking for a missing staff.
Great.
Thanks.
Why didn't you just talk to us before?
So how do we find this Mama Binturong.
Why's that?
I think we have to get through these.
(GRUNTS) Careful, these rocks are sharp.
Anga, maybe you can get through fromabove?
That'd be good news if anybody could get to it.
Of course, he can.
Right, Bunga?
Great job, Bunga.
Now let's go find that nect moja kwa mjoa stone.
Hyenas!
I thought I told you to stay out of the Pride Lands!
Lion Guard, calm the herd!
I'll take care of these guys.
That's right!
Back to the Outlands!
Now!
Whoa!
A little wet.
(COUGHS) But I'm okay.
I can see that, Ono.
And it looks like I can take that trail upriver.
Don't worry, Ono.
I'll be fine.
Besides, I don't have much of a choice.
I definitely can't cross the river here.
The water's way too rough.
Lion Guard!
Meet me at Flat Ridge Rock!
I can cross the river there!
Thanks, Bunga!
Ono!
Better go with them.
Make sure Bunga really does know where Flat Ridge Rock is.
Hmm.
No, I... I knew you were
You know me?
So, you're not in Janja's clan?
I'm going to Flat Ridge Rock,so I can get back to the Pride Lands.
If that's okay with you, hyena.
Uh-huh.
Good.
I want out
Still following me?
About going the wrong way?
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?
What?
Whoa... Heyvi kabisa!
Hey, what are you doing?
What?
Why would you help me?
You're a hyena.
All the ones I've met are.
Not all males are foolish.
Thanks... I guess.
Well, yeah!
You could have told me the trail ended before I went over the hill!
Okay, you've had your laugh.
Now I'm lost.
Can you tell me how to get to Flat Ridge Rock?
Thanks.
I'm fine.
Just a little sore from the fall.
I can handle it.
Okay.
I mean, if you want to.
(GRUNTS) Yeah, well, me too.
See that?
That's the Circle of Life for you.
Well, you are a hyena.
I guess I never really thought about it like that.
You're saying we're the same?
No, I don't think so.
I hear what you're saying
Though you've got your spots
Never thought that
Still to me,
What's wrong?
Asante, Jasiri.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, Jasiri!
Jasiri?
I'm here to help.
Yeah, I can tell.
Nice move, Jasiri.
Uh-oh.
Looks like we're cornered.
Jasiri, get behind me!
Now!
Trust me.
I've seen you in action.
You don't need a roar.
Well, not all lions are alike.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy!
She's a friend!
Definitely.
I know.
But not all hyenas are like Janja.
Some of them are good.
She's one of them.
She got me through the Outlands.
You should have seen her take on Cheezi and Chungu.
She was fierce.
(CHUCKLES) If only!
Bye, Jasiri.
Hey, guys!
Wait for me!
Get outta here, Janja!
(ROARS)
Nice work everybody.
Let's go.
C'mon, Lion Guard.
Let's go!
Till the Pride Lands end..
Okay, Janja!
We've got you... Mom!
Get away from my mom!
Of course, Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Hang on!
(STRAINING) Almost... Got you!
Mom, are you okay?
I almost lost you.
It sure was.
(SIGHS) Is everyone okay?
(SIGHS) Hevi kabisa.
The Roar did all this?
Huh?
Yeah.
Ono looks great.
Yeah... Good thing.
Heyvi kabisa!
Right.
We're on it.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Beshte's right, Ono.
Come on, we need you.
Definitely.
Now let's go!
Uh, I have a better idea.
Um... Beshte!
If you move that one big rock, it'll open up the whole thing.
Bunga, we're trying this first.
Beshte?
Everybody stand back.
We don't want any rocks to hit anybody.
Nice work, Beshte.
We'll have to go get him.
No, not the Roar.
Um, I have a better idea.
Beshte!
That dead tree!
We can use that to get to him!
Thanks, Beshte.
I'll go get the klipspringer.
(SCREAMS) Whoa!
Uh-oh!
Go back!
The wood's rotten... Hey, look!
We did it!
No reason.
After what happened with my mom, I'm afraid I might hurt someone else with the Roar like Scar.
I know, Bunga.
But that's the problem.
I couldn't control it!
I don't know if I should ever use the Roar again.
Bunga!
Shh!
Bunga, I... (SIGHS) Zuka Zama.
Sure.
Grandfather Mufasa?
I'm worried about the Roar.
The last time I used it, I was really angry.
And it caused so much destruction!
I know grandpa.
And that's why I'm thinking... (SIGHS) I shouldn't use it again.
I... I'm worried that I might turn into Scar.
Janja and the hyenas.
They were attacking my mom.
I was so mad at them when I used the Roar!
I lost control.
And it almost hurt my mom.
I almost hurt my mom!
Right.
I will.
Thank you, Grandfather.
And then I saw you surrounded by hyenas and it made me so angry.
I know I'm not supposed to use the Roar in anger.
But I did.
And, and then... So, what I need to know is... Can you ever forgive me?
But the Roar created that earthquake.
And you fell in!
I know, but... Seeing you like that... (SIGHS) Ever since, I've been afraid to use the Roar.
But how do you know I won't use it in anger again and hurt someone?
Makuu?
What's he done this... Uh, Ono?
What's on your head?
Makuu!
These Flood Plains aren't yours!
And if you're not willing to share, then it's time for you to leave.
Mom!
(GRUNTING) No.
Not in anger.
(ROARS) The next time when I say go, you leave!
Neither did I.
Guess I just had to have a little faith in myself.
Lion Guard, this way!
Yeah.
I wonder what's going on.
I bet Ono could tell us.
But I don't know where he is.
Let's find out.
Oh, yeah!
Mom?
Dad?
You've heard of Hadithi?
I've seen those prints!
But I've never seen the ceremony.
Dad, over here.
Him!
Him!
Uh... Sure.
Honored.
Of course, you do, Ono.
And while Ono spends time with Hadithi, the rest of us can go get the special leaves.
Right, guys?
(CHUCKLES) But my Dad's heard of him.
Right.
So let's go find that tallest tree.
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to leave Ono behind.
(GROANS) Yep.
Huh.
Lot of animals want to see Hadithi.
Where's Ono?
Till the Pride Lands ends... Lion Guard Defend!
There's Ono!
Back away, Janja!
Not for long.
Now, Beshte!
Go, guys!
Hurry!
Klipspringers!
Run!
I don't know who's more impressive, Ono or Hadithi!
Yeah!
Go, Ono!
Thanks, Ono.
(GASPS) You guys hear that?
I wonder what's got them so upset.
She can't hunt here.
This isn't hawk territory.
Lion Guard, let's go!
What are you doing here, hawk?
The Pride Lands aren't your hunting grounds.
That's right.
The reason there are so many different animals in the Pride Lands is because we all respect the Circle of Life.
I hope you'll do the same, and return to your own territory.
Great job, Ono.
We couldn't have stopped that hawk without you.
You did a great job today, Ono.
But now you should rest.
Okay?
Bye, Ono!
Any idea whose egg it is?
Then there has to be a good reason.
We need to find the mother hamerkop and make sure everything is okay.
(SNIFFS) Yep.
Got it.
We'll be back before you know it.
Let's go!
Uh-oh.
I know that sound... Mudslide!
And those hares are right in its path!
C'mon!
Then we have to get them out.
C'mon.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Is everybody out?
I'll get her.
(PANTING) Sure.
Wouldn't want to do that again, though.
Now, let's go find that hamerkop!
(SNIFFS) We're close.
The scent's getting stronger.
Bunga, wait!
I don't get it.
If you already have such a great nest, why'd you leave your egg with Ono?
Then, let's go!
Uh, Bunga?
I bet Ono will be happy to see you!
Is it gone?
Not your fault.
C'mon!
It's that hawk again!
We'll follow them and see what we can do!
Wish we could, Fuli.
But Ono's the only one of us that can fly.
That's a good idea, Mwoga.
Now get outta here.
Then we better get there first.
I dunno, Beshte.
But we've got to stop him before he really hurts somebody.
Come on!
Kifaru!
Stop shaking that tree!
We'll get you loose, Kifaru.
Then you can tell us what happened.
Beshte, you push the tree that way.
Fuli, Bunga, and I will move Kifaru the other way.
Ono, watch his horn but don't get too close.
Everybody ready?
Now, go!
So what's going on, Kifaru?
Why're you causing so much trouble?
You shook the baboons out of their tree.
It's like he doesn't know it's there.
That's why we need to find Mwenzi and get him to come back.
Wow!
Kifaru really listened to you, Ono.
You are the keenest of sight... You won't be just sitting around, Ono.
By guiding Kifaru to Tamasha, you'll be protecting the Pride Lands.
And protecting the Pride Lands is the Lion Guard's duty.
(SNIFFS) Yeah.
Let's go find Mwenzi.
(SNIFFING)
Hey, I think Mwenzi's been here!
I didn't see it!
I have an idea.
Sorry we tricked you, Mwenzi.
But it was the only way to get you to stop and talk to us.
You have to come back to him.
He said you just flew off for no reason.
(COUGHS)
Doesn't seem like you're doing so great either.
Looked like you were just flying around aimlessly.
Looking after Kifaru, right?
But he was!
Ono, stop!
What about Kifaru?
It's not safe to leave him alone!
You okay, Kifaru?
Know what'll make you feel better?
Sparring with other rhinos at Tamasha!
Come on, Kifaru.
Let's get you to Lake Matope.
Hop down, Bunga.
Hey, look, Kifaru!
We're almost there!
And we better go with him!
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Think again, Makuu!
No chance, Makuu!
Great job, guys.
Looks like they're having a really great time.
Ono!
Is he alright?
Beshte, see if you can move that rock.
Bunga, be ready to pull him free.
I'm coming Bunga!
Grab him, Bunga!
Don't let him fall!
(CHUCKLES)
Ono.
How's the baby gazelle?
Yep.
Come on, Lion Guard.
Let's go calm the zebras down before they hurt somebody.
Then we'll need to stop them before they get there.
Come on!
Heyvi kabisa.
Fuli, forget about stopping them.
Turn them.
(SIGHS) Okay, Lion Guard.
Slow 'em down.
Nice job, everyone.
The hyraxes are safe.
Uh, okay.
So, what caused the herd to stampede?
So you can all go home.
(SIGHS) Ono, make sure the zebras get home safe.
You're right.
I don't believe it.
Then there's no time to waste.
Ono, lead us to the zebras.
And fast.
No time for paintings, Bunga.
We need to stop the hyenas.
There they are.
Ono, lead the zebras away from the hyenas.
Try to calm them down.
You three take care of Cheezi and Chungu.
Leave Janja to me.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Bunga. What are you... Whoa!
Doesn't matter.
I know where you're going.
Bunga, why'd you do that?
No, why'd you knock me out of that tree?
I was trying to take Janja by surprise.
That wasn't exactly the plan.
How'd they get way over there?
Well, however they got there, we've got to help them get back.
Ono, lead the way.
Bunga?
Leave Ushari alone.
Oh, come on, let's find those zebras.
Great.
I'll take a look.
What are you guys doing?
What's going on?
Great.
Show us the way.
Lion Guard.
I found the zebras.
We can cross the river on this big tree branch.
Fuli.
Beshte.
Bunga.
Stop!
What's going on with everybody?
Save me?
From what?
The tree branch?
Bunga.
There's no way Rafiki's paintings tell the future.
Now let's focus on getting these zebras back to their herd.
Zebras, look out!
Hevi kabisa.
I have an idea.
Come on.
I've got to roar from that branch over the waterfall.
I don't care.
It's the only way to save the zebras.
After I roar, make sure the zebras are okay.
I hope this works.
I'm okay!
See for yourself.
Oh right, see you all later.
Nirmala?
I know this'll help me learn to stay calm when I feel annoyed...
But how much longer do I have to let these frogshop on me?
Uh, Nirmala can I please come down now?
Sorry, little guys.
Gotta go.
What's going on, Rani?
Why?
Is he okay?
Great insight, Ono.
So they can meet Beshte all over again.
Got it.
Thanks, Rani.
Yes.
You might know him as Poa... But his name's not really Poa.
It's Beshte.
It's okay.
Beshte's not here yet.
Anga, can you find Pinguino?
And Beshte, too?
Don't worry, Rani.
If anybody can find them, Anga can...
Which one?
Bunga, round up the galagos.
The galagos are safe.
Now let's stop these antelopes.
Turn 'em, Fuli.
Bupu, you can't just stampede for no reason.
You almost stomped on the galagos.
The next time you call for us.
Don't just running and putting others in danger.
They teamed up.
That's it!
The Outlanders have the Pride Landers scared because they're working together.
But we can do that, too.
Unite the Pride Landers.
If we stand together we stand stronger.
And we'll be prepared for any attack that comes.
Except, my dad doesn't want anyone to know Scar's back.
He think it'll scare e'm too much.
I know the Pride Landers will want to protect their home from any threat.
All we have to do is ask e'm.
Right.
Time to unite the Pride Lands.
It was the antelopes who gave me the idea.
But a threat to the Pride Lands anywhere is a threat to the Pride Landers everywhere.
They are Pride Landers.
Besides how much trouble can they be?
Um Laini?
Okay.
Well, one thing I've noticed about the galagos... You're really fast.
So do you think that you could get all the galagos running in the same direction at the same time?
Stay Calm.
 Got that everyone?
I know what you're thinking.
But don't worry.
We'll get them working together.
Eventually.
Okay we're gonna try something different this time.
Remember working together is an important part of being a team.
So whenever there's an emergency, you have to get there together.
What's going on?
We have to.
For the sake of the Pride Lands.
Hmm.
Maybe they need to learn from some other Pride Landers who are used to working together as a team.
Makuu, you've trainned your crocs to be a strong and unified team.
And I think the rest of the Pride Landers could learn a lot from how you train your float.
Okay, everyone, the good news is the crocodiles have agreed to help us.
I know, but he can give us some good tips on how to work together to protect the Pride Lands.
Just give him a chance.
Please?
Makuu is a good leader when he needs to be.
Maybe go keep an eye on him.
Just in case.
Bunga are you alright?
Can't be any worse.
Makuu!
That's not the way to talk to a fellow Pride Lander.
But this is my team.
We have to work together not threaten each other.
Makuu the Pride Lands belong to all of us.
Outlanders don't mess with the Pride Lands.
Lion guard, keep digging!
Faster!
We'll get to them.
Right now we gotta stop this fire before it spreads through the Pride lands.
Reposition!
Surround the flames, but stay back!
Beshte, we'll need a new trench.
Beshte, get outta there!
(SIGHS) Good work, everyone.
Ono?
how bad's the damage?
The zebras!
Ono!
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Zebras, the fire's out!
Can you tell me what you saw when the fire started?
Well there's nothing to worry about now.
You can all go back to grazing.
Uh, your grazing grounds are this way.
Ono?
Better show them home.
Rafiki.
I thought you were training Makini for the painting ceremony tonight.
We'd better find out why they're not with their herds.
I think I understand your problem.
We can take you back to your families.
If that's what you want.
Great work, Ono.
Now I'll need you and Beshte to take Furaha back to his troop.
Bunga, we'll take Chama back to Ma Tembo's herd.
Fuli, you've got Mzaha.
Okay, you three.
Come on.
Let's take you back home.
I know how important family is to you elephants, Ma Tembo.
Maybe just give Chama one more chance?
Great.
See ya, Chama.
Uh, maybe one more chance?
Good.
Ma Tembo took Chama back too.
Heyvi kabisa... Is that what I think it is?
Lion Guard, we've gotta make sure nobody's near where that lightning's gonna hit.
Great idea, Ono.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
We've gotta get you outta here!
Follow me!
We need a way out.
Zito, can you spray us a path out?
Heyvi kabisa!
Are Rafiki and Makini okay?
We need that rock, Beshte!
We've gotta get everyone outta here and go help Rafiki!
Now over here, quick!
Lion Guard!
Get everyone behind me!
(ROARS)
Until we know the lightning's over, stay away from water.
Lion Guard.
We have to save Rafiki's tree!
Rafiki, Makini!
Are you okay?
Right.
Come on.
We've almost got it!
Great job, everyone!
Makes sense to me.
Buffalo!
Slow down!
They won't stop until they get some relief.
Of course!
Ono, find some water!
We'll need enough to hold the herd!
Perfect!
well then lead the way!
Everyone right this way!
Zebras!
Get out of the way!
I said move!
I guess the flies like the water even less than you, Fuli.
They're gone!
Now we know where the flies went.
Let's go!
Beshte... How did you get stuck in there?
We'll take you to a watering hole.
It'll help keep the flies away.
So, if we stick with the zebras, we won't have to deal with the flies?
We'll take you to the nearest watering hole.
Mbeya, too.
Come on!
Where are you going, Ono?
Do not panic and run.
Madoa is our friend.
Just stay calm, stay here, and keep the flies away.
What is it, Madoa?
We'll save them, Madoa.
Just lead the way.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
You guys have a better idea?
We need your help.
The only way we can get where we're going is if you come with us.
Without you, we won't be able to tell which way we're going.
Right.
But I think you should know we're going after some bad hyenas.
Actually, we're all following Madoa.
Hang on, everybody.
you notice something?
No flies.
Yeah, but look around.
I mean, there's no flies anywhere.
They're all gone.
Yeah, we'll be faster on our own.
Thanks for your help.
And I hope you don't mind, but we'll take it from here.
You can head home.
Well... Yeah.
It'll be easy for you to get home.
See Pride Rock?
Just go that way.
You should go too, Madoa.
Make sure the rest of your clan stays safe, while we get Jasiri and the cubs.
Let's go.
How are we doing, Ono?
Great.
Lead the way.
What are you doing here?
Heyvi kabisa!
We gotta move.
Right now.
Think again, Janja.
Oh, yeah?
Watch us.
I'm coming, Jasiri.
Jasiri?
Are you okay?
You've got it.
We have to do something.
The lava's rising fast.
No time to slow down.
We need to stop Zira and her evil lions before they can harm the Pride Lands.
Madoa, do you know where Zira and her lions are?
Yeah.
We need to return to the Pride Lands and see what's happened.
And we'll need as much help as we can get.
Thank you, Mzingo.
Everyone, let's go.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Yeah, I hadn't thought of it like that.
Anga, is Kovu alone?
No, we can't be.
Okay.
I've had enough.
Everyone, get behind me!
Kiara?
Kiara, look out!
Behind you!
Get out of the way, Kiara!
They... They have?
We heard Zira was gonna attack the Pride Lands.
Where is she?
She has?
Okay.
Jasiri.
Asante.
Thanks again.
Leading the Outlands, as you were always meant to.
(LATER) Mom!
Dad!
I'll always have it.
But the venom is gone.
I'm healed.
She decided to stay.
But when we heard Zira was headed for the Pride Lands, we came back as fast as we could.
So, what happened?
We really did miss a lot.
Yeah.
Those four stars helped us find our way to the Tree of Life.
Seeing you with Kovu reminded me of a friend I made there.
Rani.
Queen Rani.
She's smart, brave, but also kind.
A great leader.
You'd like her.
Yeah, I do.
(CHUCKLES) Come on, Lion Guard.
Vitani?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
Vitani, I'm the future queen's brother.
We have the Mark of the Guard, and I have the Roar.
We're the Lion Guard.
We'll all go, then we'll figure this out.
Okay?
Okay, guys, you know what to do.
No thanks to us.
We can't help anyone if we keep arguing.
Okay... Let's do it.
Don't worry, Beshte.
We're just glad you're okay.
Great job, Fuli.
Anyone see them?
It's okay, Anga.
Vitani, you don't stand a chance.
You haven't seen everything the Roar can do.
Even without the Roar?
You're right, Vitani.
Everyone!
By choosing to face me even without the roar, Vitani has proven to be the Pride Lands' fiercest.
Vitani and her team have won.
They are the Pride Lands' new Lion Guard!
Vitani, as leader of the Lion Guard, you'll need the mark of the Guard.
And the Roar.
Askari.
Yes, Askari.
But I'm not leader of the Lion Guard anymore.
Why would I need the Roar?
The Tree of Life.
Everyone, wanna join me helping Queen Rani and the Night Pride?
Watch.
(ROARING LOUDLY)
Queen Rani?
This time, to stay.
We'll rule it together.
We're gonna make a great team.
Yes.
I am.
Careful everyone.
It gets really steep up here.
But going over the mountain should be quicker.
We're the Lion Guard, one mountain isn't going to get in our wway.
Good job, Beshte.
Now, let's try that again.
It'd take too long.
(GRUNTS) I'm the leader of the Lion Guard and I say we go this way.
I'm fine.
I just wantget to the Tree of Life as fast as possible.
I guess.
Just make it fast.
Ono, what's the next landmark?
Stop right there, Janja!
Those melons are for the elephants!
We gotta stop them!
Come on!
Give it up, Janja!
Somebody grab that last melon!
Gotta be.
The patch is really well hidden.
We'll have to keep a close eye on them, in case the hyenas come back.
It's all part of the Circle of Life.
And defending it is our job.
Fuli's right, Bunga.
Janja might come back and we can't risk losing these melons.
Ono?
Can you take another look?
Attacked?
By who?
Then we've gotta stop it!
Ono?
Be sure to keep an eye on the melons, too.
Now let's go.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Lizard!
Stop this attack!
Now!
I don't know who you are, but this is not how we do things in the Pride Lands!
That's right.
Protectors of the Pride Lands!
You asked for it.
What's going on?
Yeah, but... (GRUNTS) My legs won't move!
So that's why our legs won't move?
Ono, get Rafiki.
Maybe he has a remedy that can heal our legs faster.
Yeah!
We've gotta get back on our feet and catch that lizard!
Heyvi kabisa!
The hyenas and the monitor lizard?
They must be working together!
Janja must have asked Kenge to bite us so we couldn't stop them from taking the melons!
Bunga.
Ono.
You've gotta stop Kenge and the hyenas.
(SPUTTERS) Eat them?
The lizard bit you guys, too?
Uh, sure.
What?
Makini, we need you to help Bunga save those melons.
Thanks, Makini.
Ono, what path were the hyenas taking to the Outlands?
Okay, you two.
I have a plan.
So do I.
Time for you to go home, Kenge!
Now let's make sure the melons are safe!
What about the melons?
Bunga, are they okay?
Come on, everyone.
Let's get the melons back to the patch.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Lion Guard, we need to split up.
Fuli, you and Ono take on Goigoi.
Beshte, you and Bunga go after Makuu.
Leave Janja to me.
You three, take us to 'em.
Til the Pride Lands' end... Lion Guard Defend!
Okay, where was Janja?
Okay, stay back.
(GRUNTS) Janja!
Show yourself!
Huh, nobody here.
There's no trace of Janja and his hyenas anywhere around here.
(SNIFFING) Not even their scent!
And believe me, if they were around, you'd smell 'em.
Did you find Makuu?
Or Goigoi?
Strange, Janja wasn't here either.
I'm not so sure.
(SNIFFS) I didn't even find any hyena tracks.
No sign of Janja at all.
Right.
And Janja doesn't usually eat bugs...
are you sure it was Makuu, Goigoi, and Janja you saw?
Wait... Makuu, Goigoi, and Janja all said the same thing?
Something weird is going on.
Ono, scout the Pride Lands.
See if you can find Makuu, Goigoi, and Janja.
You guys wait here.
Time to figure out what's going on.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
(WHISPERING) Shh.
Janja.
Come on.
Well, don't worry Tamaa.
We won't let Janja hurt you.
Thanks Tamaa!
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Not so fast.
Which you've been using to scare animals all over the Pride Lands.
Tamaa, tricking others and taking their food upsets the Circle of Life.
If I had an amazing talent like yours, I'd use it to do good.
Hmmm.
Okay.
And we're here wasting time talking to you!
No more imitating!
I'm going to give you hyenas to the count of three to get out of the Pride Lands.
The faster, the better.
Let's just hope Tamaa keeps his promise so we don't any more false alarms.
Pretty quiet.
Guess Tamaa really is keeping his promise.
I never said that.
Hold on.
You say you heard me, but you didn't see me.
Maybe it was Janja.
And Tamaa.
Maybe he didn't have a choice.
C'mon Lion Guard!
To the Outlands!
Any sign of the hyenas, Ono?
It's Tamaa!
C'mon!
That's what you think!
Get away from the bird, Janja!
Now!
We'll take care of the impalas.
Why don't you find your own way home?
That was a brave thing you did back there, Tamaa.
The fiercest, bravest, fastest, strongest and the keenest of sight.
Yes but nothing about them battling an evil lion from the past who has come back.
Really?
I'm not so sure this painting kinda looks like the mark of evil.
Yes that's what Rafiki called it this painting must be very important.
Or maybe the painting came first.
Before the rock.
Beshte, think you can move this rock?
A secret cave!
Makini, what does that mean?
Then we're going to that chamber.
It may be dangerous, but we're the Pride Lands fiercest, bravest, fastest, strongest and keenest of sight.
If anyone's gonna find the secret to defeating evil, it's us.
Sorry, Makini, but you'll be safer if you stay here.
Look, another painting.
Mmm-mmm.
I'm still worried it might be too dangerous down here.
Beshte!
Thanks, Beshte.
You said it, Ono.
Maybe we're not supposed to.
Look!
The painting said the chamber was deep beneath the lair.
I think it means we're on the right path.
Come on!
We gotta be.
We're still finding paintings.
Who knows, maybe he picked the right one.
Dead end.
Let's head back.
It doesn't make sense.
Why would the paintings lead us down here if there's no way to get through?
Ono, fly up there and see if you can get the lay of the land.
Good work, Ono.
You got us through.
(LAUGHS) Luckily, we had the keenest of sight with us so you didn't have to.
Wait.
What if it's not luck at all?
What if this is all a test?
We needed the strongest and the keenest of sight to get past those first two obstacles.
All these hidden caves and challenges, it's meant to see if we're a worthy Lion Guard.
Worthy of discovering the secret to defeating great evil!
How did you make it through the maze?
Makini?
I'm not sure it's a good idea for you to be down here.
Okay, then just stay close.
Now that we know these are tests,
Hang on, Bunga.
Let's think about this.
There is?
Oh, there is.
This must be another test.
Ono!
Is there anywhere we can get out of the path of this boulder?
Fuli, what are you doing?
Huh, nice work, Fuli.
Okay, guys, this is it.
I hope.
I'm not sure, Bunga.
Is everyone all right?
Everyone stop moving!
(ECHOING) Follow my voice, and get behind me.
Keep coming, that's good.
Everyone here?
Okay, now I think I can find the way out.
Right, and I'm gonna use it to lead us all out of here.
Guys?
I think we made it.
(CHUCKLES) We've come this far.
I think we'll find it, Bunga.
But where is this unstoppable force?
What's the secret?
Okay, you guys, we've come all this way.
Is everyone ready?
Makini, will you do the honors?
There's gotta be more than this.
Heyvi kabisa!
Actually, I think there is, look.
The great force to defeating great evil is here.
It's... Exactly.
Actually, Makini, I think we had to go through those tests.
So we'd know that.
We are the powerful, unstoppable force that will defeat Scar, together.
That’s right.
Til the Pride Lands end.
Oh, that's alright.
Everyone in the Pride Lands has been on edge lately.
Lion Guard!
Somethings in the grass.
Makini?
what's wrong?
Actually it sounds like a chance to lift everyone's spirts!
We should invite everyone to Makini's mpanda mpaya.
If we turn into a big event they will.
Hang on!
It's abou you two putting on a show at Mizimu Grove.
It's for Makini's mpando mpya.
I think if we turn it into a big event, it might cheer everybody up.
Maybe you two can start it off with a song?
Then you'll do it?
It's too bad that Timon and Pumbaa aren't here to sing their song.
Ha, yourself.
Makini, Ono?
What do you think, should we find a way around it?
Through it, it is.
Let's go, and stay alert, there's no telling who or what's in here.
Anga?
Keep a look out.
Anga where's the tuliza?
Bunga are you alright?
What in the Pride Lands?
What do they want with Bunga?
Come on.
The chosen one?
Hi,everyone, my name's Kion, and we're the Lion Guard.
I know you think that Bunga's your Chosen One...
Well, he's actually part of the Lion Guard, and we have to get going.
It's nice to meet you, Domog.
Now, about the Ghost of the Mountain...
Thank you, Domog.
That's a very... Interesting legend.
But if you don't mind, I need to have a talk with the Chosen One.
Thanks.
I think we should help them, too.
I think something's scaring the red pandas from their homes.
And whatever it is, it doesn’t respect the Circle of Life.
Even though we’re not in the Pride Lands,we’re still the Lion Guard, and we defend the Circle of Life.
We're gonna find this ghost, and make it leave the red pandas alone.
Domog, if it's okay with you, the Lion Guard will help the Chosen One find the Ghost of the Mountain.
You okay, Fuli?
Keep close watch, everyone.
I think we just met the Ghost.
Anga?
Anything from up there?
It's not your fault.
Circle up!
Backs together!
It can't sneak up on us if we're watching ever direction.
We're not just looking.
We're listening.
A-ha!
(GRUNTING) (GASPS) Gone again?
Footprints!
Good thinking, Ono.
Fuli?
Let's try to catch the snow leopard's scent while we're looking for footprints.
Anything?
Let's go.
And stay close.
The snow leopard could be anywhere.
Makini, stay back with Ono.
There it is!
Fuli, with me!
Beshte, Bunga, on the left!
That's right!
And we need you to leave the red pandas alone.
This isn't about fun.
This is about forcing them out of their homes.
Let's go.
Even if they see Chuluun, I don't think those red pandas can handle her themselves.
Everyone okay?
You tell me, Chosen One.
Ono, where to next?
Okay, let's go everyone.
Everyone please, stay calm.
You all get water but you need to wait your turn.
I... I don't know.
But don't worry, I'm sure the King has a plan.
I knew my dad would have a plan.
Do you think she'll say yes?
Don't worry, Dad, we won't let you down.
Be alert, guys.
This part of the Back Lands is leopard territory.
Yeah, haven't seen you since we kicked you out of the Pride Lands.
Back off, Makucha.
We don't want any trouble.
We're just passing through.
Come on, Makucha.
Just let us through.
Let's go.
But keep your guard up.
I don't trust that guy.
Come on out, Makucha.
We know you're in there.
Excuse me, zebras?
Sorry to interrupt.
We're looking for a zebra named Dhahabu.
Can you take us to her
Um, will you take us to her?
No idea.
Dhahabu, hello, my name is Kion.
I'm here with the rest of the Lion Guard...
Let me start over.
I'm the leader of the Lion Guard.
And this is Fuli, Beshte, Bunga and Ono.
Beshte's right.
We need to talk to her and make friends.
Just like my dad said.
My dad's a good leader.
Everyone loves him 'cause he tries to keep everyone safe.
It is.
So my dad sent us to ask if we can share your watering hole.
We'd be happy to do something for you in return.
Just name it.
You got it.
One Tamboa plant, coming up.
Sure, whatever you want.
Our pleasure.
Ono, you know what this Tamboa plant looks like?
We'll find a way.
A lot of animals are counting on us.
Ono, take the lead.
Ono, are you sure this is the only way?
Good.
'Cause I think we'll need you at full strength.
Ono, you said it was rare.
You didn't say it was huge.
Great job, Beshte.
Now let's get that plant back to Dhahabu.
Okay, Dhahabu.
One Tamboa plant, as requested.
It wasn't easy.
But we delivered our side of the deal.
So if you could show us the watering hole...
Ono, try to get a look at the watering hole.
Maybe there's reason she doesn't want us to use it.
Why didn't you tell your herd?
A good leader tells her herd the truth, Dhahabu.
Even if it's bad news.
And when there's a problem, a good leader tries to help.
We can do better than that, Bunga.
Lion Guard, let's go take a look.
Any idea why it dried up?
Okay, maybe we can unblock it and let the water flow again.
Lion Guard, let's get to the top of that cliff.
Okay, Dhahabu, come on.
We're not taking it, Makucha.
We just wanna move the rocks so the zebras can have water too.
Dhahabu, take cover.
Beshte, move the rocks.
So if there's a problem, a good leader does something about it.
Right?
Isn't that what a good leader does?
Thanks for sharing, Makucha.
Thanks, Dhahabu.
You really are a good leader.
Huh?
What's that?
Anga, how much to the waterfall?
Right, Anga lead the way!
Then let's get going.
Makucha!
Makucha, listen.
We don't want any trouble.
Hevi kabisa!
Everyone!
Down!
Anga!
Do you see shelter?
(GROANS) Is everyone okay?
Get out of here, Makucha!
(GROWLS)
(GROWLS)
Back off, Makini!
(GROWLS)
Yeah.
Sorry, Makini.
Yeah.
(CHEWING SOUND) Thanks.
(SWALLOWS) Okay.
Let's get going.
Don't worry about it, Ono.
Nothing you could've done to stop it.
Everyone!
Calm down.
None of us wanna be stuck here together, but we're all better off here than out there.
I don't know.
Uh, sure?
I know, but... We do need to get to the Tree of Life as soon as we can.
He might be our best chance.
But, what?
Come on, Fuli.
If it's a trap, you know we can handle 'em.
Lead the way, Makucha.
Everyone!
Head for that canyon!
Hurry!
Whoa.
Thanks, Makucha.
Makucha?
Where is he?
He's supposed to be leading us.
Makucha.
Where'd you go?
Okay.
Lion Guard, let's head out.
Makucha!
These winds are crazy!
I think we should stop!
It's okay, we got through the harmattan all right, Thanks to Ono.
Our team wouldn't be the same without you.
So, Where to next?
Okay everyone, let's go find the Tree of Life.
Get outta the Pride Lands Kiburi now.
And that includes your whole float too.
Oh no you won't.
Is everyone alright?
Where's Bunga?
Well I don't know Bunga it looks like it hurts maybe you should ask Rafiki to have him take a look at your back.
Take it easy Bunga it's only Jasiri.
You wish.
Oh yes of course you don't know anything about Scar.
It's not just a legend Jasiri not anymore Scar's back he appears to Janja and all the others in the volcano.
He's the one behind these attacks sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
If you want I could ask for your clan to stay here in the Pride Lands until we defeat Scar.
Bunga are you sure you're alright?
Madoa is there any news from the hyena resistance?
Okay thanks Madoa.
Hey Ono is there any sign of them yet?
Okay Bunga and Beshte you take the jackals Fuli and Ono you're with me til the Pride Lands end.
Stop right there crocs you keep forgetting where the Pride Lands end Kiburi.
Get out.
Jasiri.
Yes indeed I can't thank you enough.
Thanks for the warning Madoa.
And thank Jasiri too.
Well here we go again.
Come on back to Mizimu Grove.
Ono see what you can see?
We better hurry.
Till the PrideLands End!
That's close enough!
Now back off of Jasiri's clan.
And we have you surrounded.
Now!
You need to leave like right now.
We'll see about that.
We did it.
Kwetu Ni Kwetu?
This is their home.
Jasiri knows it better then anyone.
(SNIFFING) Mmm-hmm.
Gotcha!
Now it's your turn to be it and my turn to hide!
It's not just hide-and-seek.
It's a way to practice our tracking skills.
He laughed when I walked past him.
Oh, yeah, I found him.
I just haven't told him yet.
Okay, Beshte!
You can come out from behind the rocks now!
Okay, Fuli.
Everyone's been it but you.
Close your eyes so we can go hide.
Fuli!
What is it?
You find something?
Heyvi kabisa!
These are leopard tracks!
Well, there's one now.
The question is, where?
Ono?
Lead the way, Ono.
Till the Pride Lands' end... Lion Guard Defend!
(GROWLING) Get out of the Pride Lands, leopard!
Now!
This guy's not gonna be easy to catch.
That's why we've got to get him out of the Pride Lands.
None of the herds know that leopards are hunters.
That's why we gotta find him.
Now let's split up so we can cover more ground.
Fuli, you're with me.
Bunga, you Ono and... Hey, where is Beshte?
Beshte.
Glad they could find you.
There's a leopard in the Pride Lands.
Who's Ajabu?
What's going on?
Guys!
We don't have time to talk about this right now.
And it's up to us to catch him.
Now, let's go!
Till the Pride Lands' end... Lion Guard Defend!
More leopard tracks.
Makucha definitely came this way.
The leopard's headed this way.
(GASPS) Come on!
You sure it was the leopard?
Bunga, you really hurt his feelings.
Why don't you two believe him?
I do.
Beshte doesn't make things up.
Besides, did you hear him say his new friend was chased here by a leopard?
So we have a strange animal who says he was chased here by a leopard.
And we have a leopard!
Good idea.
And if we believe in Beshte's friend, we've got to believe that the leopard's looking for him.
Beshte!
Wait for us!
The leopard!
Come on!
Till the Pride Lands' end... Lion Guard Defend!
Anybody else think it's weird that the leopard didn't go after any of the zebras?
So you think the leopard was after your new pal?
Well, they're in the Pride Lands now.
And the Lion Guard is gonna keep Ajabu safe!
Uh-oh!
So has the leopard!
Lion Guard, let's go!
This is our business.
So it's time for you to say goodbye!
Bunga, let go!
It's what we do.
I think I've got an idea.
Mom, Dad?
Ajabu came to the Pride Lands as a visitor, but he'd really like to stay.
If he has your blessing.
Then we're still on the right path to the Tree of Life.
Just like the dry season back home.
Ono, what's the next landmark?
That's it!
Keep it up, everyone!
We can't let the fire spread!
(PANTING) Nice work, you guys.
The fire would've been a lot worse for Ma Tembo and the elephants.
The Kilio Valley is safe now, Ma Tembo.
You're good to go back.
Okay.
Zito, Zigo, you're with Fuli and Bunga on fire breaks.
Let's go.
Get away from her Kiburi!
It just makes sense.
Giraffes and elephants are both big.
Their home is gone, Bupu.
I understand thank you grandfather.
I'm not losing any more of the Pride Lands.
It's not just a party, Bunga.
(SIGHS) The Outlands.
I wish the Lion Guard defended the Circle of Life out there, too.
Of course.
You're right, Dad!
Lion Guard, let's go!
We're gonna save that pup!
Till the Pride Land's end... Lion Guard Defend!
Not today, Janja!
Making sure you let that pup go!
Uh, okay.
Well, I'm glad we could help.
You're safe now, Dogo.
But I'd stay away from Janja's territory if I were you.
Well, it is Kupatana.
Okay, Dogo.
You can come.
Well, I think we should at least give Dogo a chance.
Well, we've never had a guest from the Outlands on Kupatana before.
But Dogo's just one little jackal.
It might be good for him to learn about Kupatana.
Come on.
Here you go, Dogo.
You can make yourself at home on this hillside.
Welcome to the Pride Lands, Dogo.
Now, let's split up so we can finish our patrol just in time for Kupatana.
Ono, Fuli, you're with me.
We'll meet up back at the lair.
Ono!
What do you see?
Oh, okay, Ono.
Lead the way!
Hevi kabisa!
Where's Dogo?
Who are you?
Enough!
Which one of you is Dogo?
Dogo, I thought you said you didn't have any family.
Okay, yeah.
I can see that.
But... Okay, Reirei.
You and your family have to stay away from the aardvarks' dens.
And food.
Got it?
Lion Guard, follow me!
Hakuna Matata, Mbeya.
It's okay.
We've still got time to hit the watering hole and get cleaned up before the celebration.
Or maybe not.
What about all these other animals?
We do.
It's Kupatana.
We're actually gathering in Mizimu Grove tonight to celebrate Kupatana.
Maybe, but only if you treat everyone in the Pride Lands with respect.
Can you and your family do that?
Okay.
Now we should go.
We need to clean up for the Kupatana celebration.
Oh, no.
It's Reirei and her jackal family!
Sorry, Dad.
This is my fault.
But I know what to do.
Everyone!
Don't be afraid!
We've gotta round up these jackals and send them back to the Outlands where they belong.
Ono?
Come on, where are you, Reirei?
Drop the hyrax.
You lied to me, Reirei.
Save it.
You're going back to the Outlands.
All of you.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Yeah, but you didn't tell me to invite him into the Pride Lands.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.
It's the Circle of Life.
Happy Kupatana, Dad.
How about a lion that's no so sleepy?
Thought you could use some help your majesty.
I can't.
Beshte, don't let Ora pass.
Fuli,go get Chuluun.
Ah, right.
Of course.
How can we help?
Got it.
Lion Guard, let's go.
Sorry, Rani.
We came to help.
But I kind of made things worse.
Am I?
I became leader of the Lion Guard when I got the Roar.
But now, I can't control the Roar.
I've been messing things up like I did just now.
Maybe I shouldn't be leading.
At least until my scar is healed.
Looks like your team could use some rest.
The Lion Guard could patrol during the day while you rest.
Okay, then the Lion Guard will start patrolling right away.
Then the rest of the Lion Guard will start right away.
Ugh!
My scar.
I can't wait till it's healed and gone.
But that's the whole reason I'm here.
To heal my scar.
So I can be my old self again.
What do you mean?
What?
Aren't you gonna stay here and help me?
Looke inside myself?
Well, yeah.
At leat there aren't any tree frogs jumping on me.
It's okay.
I've just been here reflecting, thinking, and I could use a break.
My scar.
Nirmala says it might not ever be totally healed.
But if it never heals, I might not be able to use the Roar again.
And without the Roar, I don't known if I can lead the Lion Guard.
You're saying I should give up the Roar?
Leave it behind?
I don't think so, Bunga.
Yeah, guess I'll get back to reflecting.
Bunga, guys.
I thought you were on patrol.
Race you to the watering hole.
Guess Beshte's a rotten egg.
No time to tell my dad.
We gotta stop that hyena ourselves.
Come on.
Oh, yeah?
Well, there's four of us.
Give us that egg, hyena.
I don't care who you are.
You hyenas aren't allowed to steal that egg.
We are.
Beshte, get Cheezi.
Fuli, take Chungu.
Bunga, go for the egg.
Leave that Janja to me.
Get out of the Pride Lands.
Now!
Hevi kabisa!
It's not just cracked, it's hatching!
I remember that day.
Maybe you're right.
Back then I didn't even know about the Lion Guard or the Roar.
Actually, it's almost time for the Night Pride to take over.
Thanks, Ullu.
Alert the Night Pride.
Lion Guard, follow me.
Then we need to hurry.
Come on.
That's gotta be Mama Binturong's plan.
Attacking when we're tired.
Surak, Baliyo, attack Ora from both sides at once.
Anga, can you take care of Mama Binturong?
Nirmala, with me and Fuli.
It's over.
Get out.
Good job, everyone.
Yeah, but I had forgotten it.
Guess it took a little reflection.
I'm not sure about the Roar.
Guess i need to reflect about that too.
(YAWNS) But tomorrow.
I'm tired.
Grandfather Mufass?
Grandfather, for the first time since I got my scar, I finally feel like myself again.
Maybe.
I know now that my scar doesn't make me me.
And maybe the Roar doesn't either.
Queen Janna said that Roar was supposed to return to the Tree of Life.
Maybe she meant I neeeded to give it back.
You were a great leader and you didn't have the Roar.
I think I can be a great leader without it too.
I'm ready to give it back.
Uh, hello?
Askari.
You were leader of the first Lion Guard.
I am.
And I always thought the Roar was what made me leader of the Lion Guard.
I've always beem a leader.
Even before the Roar.
It's who I am.
But I'm not sure if I can control the Roar anymore.
So, I've come to give it back.
I don't need it.
I see 'em!
Makuu!
Incoming!
Hey, Beshte.
You okay?
Kiburi.
Why are you back in the Pride Lands?
Kiburi!
That's enough!
Careful, Bunga...
Then we better check it out.
Till the Pride Lands' end... Lion Guard Defend!
Sounds like we're close.
Well, whatever they are, they need to leave those pangolins alone!
Hey!
You two!
Put down the pangolins!
Sure.
If you promise to stop messing with the pangolins.
So, who are you?
And what are you doing in the Pride Lands?
Hafifu!
Why'd you do that?
Ushari's not a stick!
You just heard him say so!
That won't be necessary.
Look.
I'll take you to my dad so you can give him your message.
Now come on.
Walk this way.
Yes.
You know them?
So... Majinuni and Hafifu really do have an important message for you?
(SIGHS) They're coming.
Can't you just send them back and get the message again?
Got it.
Where's their home?
Wow!
That's a long way off.
Majinuni, Hafifu.
Can you tell us where your dad is?
You guys really don't know how to get home from here?
Ono?
Where to next?
Great.
Then we'll go that way.
Guys?
Any of this look familiar?
(SIGHS EXASPERATEDLY) I was talking to you!
You're the gorillas!
(SIGHS) Yeah...
So which way do we go from here?
No, wait!
Come back!
Ono?
Please follow them.
Where are you?
You smell 'em?
(SNIFFS) Yeah, me neither.
Stay still!
When I call your names, shout back.
We'll follow your voices and find you!
Fine.
Right.
Let's go!
This game isn't working!
Chase them?
Okay.
Thanks, Ono!
Let's go!
Majinuni!
Hafifu!
You think the gorillas split up?
The forest hog!
It's after them!
(GROWLS) Back off of the gorillas!
You can't get to them without going through me.
And you're not getting through me.
Hafifu?
Majinuni?
You okay?
I knew something was going on!
You couldn't be that silly.
Okay.
So tell me.
Why don't you want to see your father?
I get it.
I never want to let down my dad either.
It's the whole reason I'm here.
I'm really sorry.
I wish I could do something to make it easier.
Trust me.
If you act like a prince, sooner or later, you'll start to feel like a prince.
Oh, it's on.
Kuishi ni kucheka!
Whoa!
Guys?
Guys!
Whoa!
So far!
But I can't hang on long!
Not helping, Ono!
You saved me.
Thanks.
Oh no!
It was more than that.
It was brave.
Doing something like that is what you makes you prince material.
Totally.
Um, speaking of your message for my dad?
We do need to give it to him.
Is that's a problem?
And, so... Here we are.
Uh, yeah... It's just... Are you sure?
Okay... Kuishi ni kucheka!
Come on.
I want toget outta here before night fall.
Don't you worry Fuli, we'll be on the other side soon.
Right Anga?
Get ready, everyone.
Here it comes.
Hey!
Stop!
Let's talk for a second.
Fuli!
Look out!
Right.
Thanks, Fuli.
But why were they so mad?
Ono,What do you think?
Ono?
Where are they?
Okay.
Then we'll have to track them another way.
Fuli?
Hmm.
We don't have time for this.
We need to find Makini and Ono, so we can get out of this marsh and find the next moja kwa moja stone!
Let's make a break for it.
Everyone, follow Fuli!
Good work, Fuli.
Anga, can you get a better view here?
These tracks only lead to more tracks.
That doesn't make anysense.
Why would Makini run in circles?
Look out for clues.
Makini and Ono have to be close.
That's enough.
Why do you keep attacking us?
Snails?
Listen, I amreally sorry.
We had no idea the snails belonged to you.
We are not leaving until we find our friends.
Makini?
Makini, where's Ono?
Yeah.
What happened to you, guys?
The zebras and the gazelles are in trouble?
If the zebras and gazelles really are fighting, we better check it out.
Till the Pride Lands end... Lion Guard Defend!
Something's not right.
Ono!
Can you see Muhimu and Swala?
Then that's where we're going!
Come on!
Muhimu!
Swala!
Stop!
Hey... Enough!
What's going on?
Swala, Muhimu.
I thought you two were friends!
Beshte's right.
These grazing grounds are for everyone.
There's plenty of grass for zebras and gazelles.
There's no other grass at all?
Well, then we just need to find a place with enough grass for all of you.
I don't know... But I know who will!
Isn't there somewhere with enough grass for the herds to share?
Mbali Fields?
But that's at the very edge of the Pride Lands.
You think they can make it?
You want me to lead a migration?
Thanks, Dad.
I won't let you down.
Great.
Did you scout us the best route?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Listen up, everybody!
It's a long way to Mbali Fields.
But I'll do my best to get you all there safe and sound!
Uh, thanks.
Well, let's move out!
Ono, point the way!
How's it look from above, Ono?
I'd better give 'em some encouragement.
Hey, everyone!
I know you're tired and I know you're hungry but... It's not much farther, I promise.
We'll get to Mbali Fields soon!
We will get to Mbali Fields soon, right?
We're almost there, everyone!
See the patch of green at the end of the canyon?
Everyone!
Slow down!
The slope is too steep.
Lion Guard, we gotta stop them!
I'm on it!
Everyone, stop!
Back!
Run back, now!
(SIGHING) Guess we're not as close as we thought.
Well, the herds can't go over it.
And we can't go through it.
So we've got to go around it.
Ono.
Scout out another route to the grazing grounds.
Any luck?
I promised my dad we'd get these herds to their new home.
And if we have to go through the Outlands to get there, then that's what we're going to do.
(GROANS)
Flash flood!
Higher ground, everyone!
Move!
No animal gets lost!
Let's go!
Ono, keep these animals
Don't panic, Swala!
I'll get you!
Here we go!
I don't know.
Keep an eye on the herds.
I'll be back.
Grandfather, I don't know what to do.
Dad trusted me to lead the herds.
But everything went wrong.
And now they all think I'm a bad leader.
And I think they might be right.
I really do want them to trust me.
Thank you, Grandfather.
Hey, guys!
We're not there yet.
It's taking longer than we thought.
But I know we'll make it.
Trust me.
Thanks, Muhimu.
There's a whole new life for you at Mbali Fields.
Now we have to cut through the Outlands.
I won't lie.
There are predators there.
But you're with the Lion Guard, and we'll keep you safe.
That's a promise!
We will keep you safe!
So, who's ready?
This way, everyone!
Remember, everybody.
We're in the Outlands now.
Be as quiet as you can.
Got it?
You're having a baby?
Right now?
What do we do?
Fuli's right.
There's a lot of predators out here.
If we want to keep everyone safe, we need to split up.
You three take the herds to the new grazing grounds.
I'll stay here with Bunga and Muhimu.
What I need is to protect the Circle of Life.
That means taking care of this baby and the herds.
Fuli.
You know it's the right thing to do.
Wouldn't expect you to.
That's just what they want!
We have to stick together!
Circle around Muhimu and the baby!
Now!
Thanks.
Now circle up!
Forget it, Janja.
We're not making it easy for you.
You'll have to deal with all of us.
(GROWLING) Beat it, Janja!
Nothing went the way we thought it would, but we still got everyone here safe.
Wait.
Instead of pulling Bupu out of the tree, why don't we just break off the branch that's stuck?
Why don't you just see if you can break off a piece, Bunga.
Nyuni, would you mind if you had to find a new nest?
Oh, hey, Zazu.
Wait.
I think I know how you can both be happy.
And you get to see even more of the Pride Lands this way.
Thanks, Zazu.
It's his job, Fuli.
Even us.
Remember that time he was after you to slow down when we were little?
Fuli, he was in Makuu's mouth.
Not everyone can be that brave.
Zazu missed the Morning Report?
Zazu?
That doesn't sound like him.
We just saw him a little while ago.
Maybe he's just late?
Don't worry, Dad.
We'll find him and make sure he's okay.
And I know just where to start.
How about you, Nyuni?
Seen anything from up there?
Ah, right.
Of course.
Ono, scan the skies.
Fuli, see if you can track him by scent.
Definitely not.
And I bet it has something to do with these hyena tracks.
I'm not waiting to find out.
Follow me.
Janja!
Let Zazu go!
No, I came to rescue my friend!
This better work.
Zazu?
You okay?
Come on, Zazu.
Let's get you back to Pride Rock.
Not me.
We're even.
Maybe you forgot that you saved me from the crocs when I was a little cub.
But I never did.
Okay, Lion Guard.
Let's just make sure the path is clear and nobody in the crowd gets hurt.
Yeah Dhahabu's watering hole is helping everyone in the Pride Lands get through the dry season.
Well you're majesty.
It's good to see you too.
Just think of it as going on patrol, with a speical guest.
Ono, what's wrong?
Heyvi Kabisa!
The Queen!
Fuli, Get the Queen to safety!
Bunga!
Beshte!
Fire Break!
Let's keep it buring towards the cliffs!
We need to put out the hot spots!
You too, Ono!
The fire's out is everyoneokay?
That's really nice of you, Your Majesty.
But Fuli's already a member of the Lion Guard.
I'm sure Fuli would be pleased to act as your personal guard for your visit.
Remember?
Sharing her water?
Do what she asks?
It's okay.
She's got Fuli.
I'll have Ono keep an eye on them too.
And we'll go on patrol.
Lion Guard let's go!
Don't worry.
We can find her for you.
Let's go!
But we can!
Way to go Fuli!
I got an idea that will give everyone what they want.
But I'm going to need a little time.
Raha?
Starehe?
I was what you did to protect Dhahabu.
Why would'nt you let me tell her about it?
I think Raha and Starehe would make a great queen's guards!
She might think differently.
If she saw you two in action.
Are you going tomiss being Queen Dhahabu's guard?
Ugh!
I don't need help.
I'm fine.
Let's just keep walking.
What?
I said I'm fine!
WHAT!
(growls) Bunga!
Sorry, everyone.
Sorry, Bunga.
Yeah.
Come on.
Let's keep going.
Guess we better go after him.
Well, if we can't drink the water, we should move on.
I need Tuliza.
Okay.
I'll give it a try.
(EXHALES) You know what?
You're right.
I do feel better Mmm.
Uh, you guys?
Something's happening.
Woah!
Check it out!
I'm floating!
Yeah.
But this is the best I've felt in days.
So peaceful.
You guys?
What's going on here?
What's going on?
Okay, but.
Happy lion thoughts?
Hey!
Get away!
Leave me alone!
(GROWLS) That's enough!
I'm warning you flamingos.
Take off now, or I'll send you flying!
(GROWLS)
(MOANS) (SIGHS) Thanks, Makini.
(EXHALES) A lot better.
Sorry, flamingos, I didn't mean to scare you.
We should get back on the path to the Tree of Life.
Leave these flamingos in peace.
Whatta we got, Ono?
Hyenas?
Ono, report!
Bunga, the Lion Guard's duty is to defend the Circle of Life.
Even if it means helping a hyrax out of a thorn bush.
Listen.
We don't need my Roar to clear the thorn bushes.
We can just pull 'em aside.
Thanks, Fuli.
Nice work, Bunga.
Everything okay, Beshte?
Aw, come on.
That's just how Bunga smells.
He's always been a bit, uh, fragrant.
Heyvi kabisa.
I don't like thismashindano thing.
Why should a fight determine who the crocodile leader is?
That was different.
I think Makuu's just looking to pick a fight.
I guess.
Good question, Ono.
Come on, Pua.
Get him.
What?
You mean Makuu wins?
I just hope Makuu's big win isn't a big loss for the Pride Lands.
We're on it!
Lion Guard, let's go!
Heyvi kabisa!
Isn't anyone in the Pride Lands in their usual habitat?
Lion Guard!
Let's go talk with Makuu and get this sorted out.
Guys, fighting isn't the answer to everything.
I'm not afraid!
Let's go.
If I start using the Roar when I'm angry, I'll be as bad as Scar.
Besides, the Roar might destroy whatever fish are left in the lake.
There's gotta be another way to get the crocs to leave Big Springs.
Wait!
I've got an idea...
I was thinking.
If you called for anothermashindano, you might be able to beat Makuu.
Then you could lead the crocodiles again!
But that doesn't make him a better leader than you!
Of course not!
The Circle of Life depends on us.
I don't know yet.
Maybe my dad has some ideas.
Hey, Kiara!
Is Dad back?
Oh, no...
We're working on it, Kiara.
But Makuu won't listen to reason!
(SNIFFS) How are mint leaves gonna get Makuu to leave Big Springs?
I... I don't know yet.
You guys head back to the Lair.
I need some time to think.
Grandfather, I don't know if you can hear me.
But, I'm not sure what to do.
The new crocodile leader, Makuu, he's messed things up for animals all over the Pride Lands.
And all he wants to do is fight!
I think Makuu's a bully.
But Pua, the old crocodile leader, says I should just back down.
But fighting can't be the solution to every problem!
I think I understand.
I hope we still can, Ono.
Perfect!
Bunga, Fuli, Ono, go make sure the grove is clear of animals.
'Cause nobody's where they usually are today.
Beshte, you're with me!
Makuu, you and your crocs need to leave Big Springs now.
Or the Lion Guard will force you out.
You better believe it.
Okay, Makuu.
If you want a fight, the Lion Guard can bring it.
Just be careful what you ask for.
Because of this.
Looks like the Circle of Life's back in balance.
What we have another emergency?
Yeah, I guess so.
C'mon everyone, let's go!
Well, I've seen enough!
It's way too crazy down there.
If I use the Roar, I might hurt the elephants too and even worse I'll be as bad as Scar.
Bunga.
You, me, and Ono will chase the hyenas out of the herd.
Fuli, you round'em up.
Beshte?
You send'em flying.
(ROARS) Janja!
Beshte!
Now!
Get outta here, Janja!
Is everyone all right?
Maybe if they respected the Circle of Life they'd still have food to eat.
I know exactly what you mean (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS)
Ono, keep an eye on the elephants in case the hyenas come back.
I'll meet up with you there.
I need to talk to someone first.
Yes, Grandpa.
The dry season has just started and the Guard's been busier than ever.
It seems like everyone needs the Lion Guard's help What did they do before we were here?
Can't they at least take care of themselves?
Yeah.
I guess.
I know.
There's less food and water, And the heat slows everyone down.
They don't always make the best decisions.
The dry season's even got me feeling kinda snippy.
I know.
I'll be careful not to lose control of the Roar.
Or I'll turn into Scar.
Thank you, Grandpa.
What?
How did you... Who are you?
Rafiki's new apprentice?
Oh, well that explains...
I kinda believe it.
Makini, shh!
Rafiki doesn't talk about being able to hear the Lions of the Past.
If everyone knew the things Rafiki can do, nobody in the Pride Lands would leave him alone!
Even I only talk to Mufasa when I really need advice.
What?
Don't tell me they're after the elephants again.
Okay.
Go tell the rest of the Guard.
Then let's go!
Nice meeting you, Makini!
Good luck training with Rafiki!
Lion Guard!
Regroup!
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
Not this time, Beshte.
Ono, have Ma Tembo lead the elephants to the base of that cliff wall.
You three, make sure the baboons keep following the elephants.
That's exactly what I want the hyenas to think.
I'm going to the top of that cliff.
I've had just about enough of you and your hyenas!
Right.
Baboons!
What's going on with you guys?
Well, if you're okay with it.
Good luck, Ma Tembo.
Me too, Beshte.
But this is Ma Tembo's role.
Just like defending the Pride Lands is ours.
Still, I should probably mention what's going on to my dad.
I know.
I just wish I could help.
I know what it's like to be a new leader with new responsibilities.
This role of leadership
Sometimes I stumble and trip
Get stronger from the fall
I have to find it within me
It's more than I expected
I try to do my best
I never thought I'd be a hero
And yet we've both embraced our roles
I guess life is full of responsibilities.
And we all have our own to take care of.
Thanks, Dad.
Hi again, Makini.
Sure, Rafiki.
I'll make sure we're all there.
Unofficially, yeah.
She's, uh, very talkative.
According to Ono's.
last report, she's still searching.
I'm not sure there's anything you can do to help, Kiara.
Rafiki is supposed to introduce Makini.
Good luck, Kiara.
Makini?
What's wrong?
Ono!
See if you can spot Janja and his clan!
Right.
What matters now is that we rescue Kiara!
C'mon!
Ono!
What do you see?
The only reason he'd hold Kiara prisoner is because he wants something from me or my Dad.
I have an idea.
The hyenas will be expecting me to come to the rescue.
But if they think I'm the only one here, I might be able to lure them away from Kiara.
Okay.
I'll go this way and try to distract Janja and the others.
Asante,Fuli.
Thanks.
You know why I'm here, Janja.
Just let Kiara go.
Or there's gonna be trouble.
We both know I don't need the Guard for back up.
But you might need your hyenas.
Only if I have to.
Stop playing games, Janja.
What do you want, Janja?
What?
You dragged my sister to the Outlands.
You're holding her prisoner.
And you're doing all of this, because you want me to leave you alone?
Janja, that's a terrible plan!
Even for you!
We win again, Janja.
Don't threaten my family, Janja!
Oh, yes, there is!
(ROARING)
Oh,Heyvi kabisa.
Nice work, everybody.
I let Janja get to me.
I got really angry.
And I kinda lost control of the Roar.
Yeah, I guess it was.
I guess that's what really counts.
I'm just glad nothing else bad happened.
Still no luck, Ma Tembo?
Nice job, Ma Tembo.
Even though it was frustrating, you never gave up.
Yes.
Yes it is.
Heyvi kabisa.
Thank you, You're Majesty.
My Friend Ono and I have come to be healed.
Uh, yeah.
You know about the Roar?
Yes.
Ono's eyes are hurt.
And my scar... I can't control the Roar.
Then I'd like to start right away.
Thank you, You're Majesty.
And this is where you'll heal my scar.
So I can control the Roar?
How long's it gonna take?
I'll be right back.
Wouldn't it be faster just to swim across the river?
Then climb the ridge to get to the flower.
Where have I heard that before?
(SIGHS) Okay.
I'll try it your way.
So where are the logs?
Yeah, but how long is that gonna take?
It could be days!
(SIGHS LOUDLY) Fine.
I could have waited for logs back in the Pride Lands.
What?
He did?
Finally!
(GRUNTS) Woah!
(SIGHS) And we're waiting.
Again.
Do you want me too?
I'm waiting for a log.
It's really not.
They might.
Come on!
Hevi Kabisa!
We came to help?
Makucha?
We know Makucha.
And probably the other two.
They must have followed us here.
I'm really sorry.
This is all our fault.
I wouldn't call three an army.
I am sorry.
Your Majesty.
I had no idea they were following us.
(SIGHS) Yes, Your Majesty.
Still no log.
(SIGHS) Nirmala, if you'd let me do it my way, I'd have the flower and be by now!
Argh... Yes!
Forget it!
This time I'm doing it my way!
Woah.
This current is stronger than it looked.
Straight up the slope looks faster to me.
Whoa.
It's going just... Fine!
(GROANS) Where's the flower?
Why didn't you get it while you were up there?
Yeah?
What's gonna happen tomorrow?
(SIGHS) Try again, Try again. That's all Nirmala ever says!
Ugh!
But how is falling into a river suppossed to heal me?
Okay.
I'll try again tomorrow.
I'm ready to try again.
Patience.
Patience.
Try again.
I'll come with you.
They followed me here.
Let me help kick them out!
(SIGHS) Stay focused... Finish the task.
Made it.
Now where's that flower?
Heyvi kabisa!
The Night Pride.
And Baliyo's down.
Nirmala said to finish the task.
No matter what.
But now I can help!
Let Nirmala guide me...
(PANTING) I hope I get there in time..
Surprise, Makucha!
Nirmala?
I did get the flower.
But it got trampled in the battle.
I don't think so.
There's more I have to do, isn't there?
Guess I just need patience.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, thanks, Beshte.
Just be careful on that ledge.
Pretty good, Mtoto.
They must be on their way to the Savannah Summit!
Dad says getting different animals to agree helps the Circle of Life.
Especially with the dry season approaching.
Crocodile?
I bet he's trying to spoil the summit!
He's never cared about the Circle of Life.
Come on!
Dad!
Look out!
(GROWLS) You won't ruin the Savannah Summit today, Makuu!
You were?
Uh, Dad?
Can I talk to you?
Alone?
Dad, you know we've had a lot of trouble with Makuu.
I don't trust him.
Yeah, but to invite him to the Savannah Summit?
With all these other peaceful animals?
Maybe that worked with Pua, the old crocodile leader.
But Makuu?
He's got more enemies than friends.
Okay, Dad.
Sure.
I don't know.
Makuu might say all the right things to my dad.
But I still don't trust him.
We need to keep an eye on him.
What?
Where did he go?
This is exactly what I was worried about!
Come on!
That's enough, Makuu!
Beshte.
Makuu!
I'm warning you.
I won't let anyone ruin the Savannah Summit.
Especially you.
Yeah.
Thanks, Mtoto.
Hey, Mtoto.
You think you could keep your ears open for the rest of the summit?
Let us know if you hear anything suspicious?
I'm pretty sure Makuu's up to something.
So we need to be ready for any sign of trouble.
All of us.
Wait!
What exactly did Twiga say about Makuu?
And ruin the summit.
I bet that's what Makuu's been planning all along!
Back off, Makuu!
Where is he?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Hmm.
What if he threatened them, and they're to afraid to tell us?
That's how much he must've scared them.
Just having Makuu here is hurting the summit.
This way.
Where's Zazu?
Is he in trouble?
Uh, Rafiki?
(SIGHS) Will someone just tell me what happened?
Let's go!
Gotcha!
(GROANS)
Dad?
I know, Dad.
But there's something going on!
But he just wants to ruin it!
I... I'm sorry, Dad.
I'll say.
No, I didn't.
Apparently, Bupu didn't need saving.
I... I don't know.
I need some time to think.
Grandfather Mufasa?
My Dad is really upset with me.
And I'm worried that I ruined his summit.
I didn't mean to.
It's just... I was so sure Makuu wanted to ruin it.
Well, he... He... Nothing really.
But I've got this feeling that something bad's going to happen.
And that means stopping Makuu.
Right?
Leap to conclusions, and you leap to confusions.
Without jumping to conclusions.
Right.
Thank you, Grandfather.
I'll do my best.
What?
Makuu's attacking?
Mtoto?
Easy, Bunga.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Mtoto, can you listen again?
Okay.
But so far, Makuu hasn't done anything wrong.
You're right, Fuli.
Makuu does have a lot of enemies here.
But he seems like he wants to change that.
But even if he's ready to change, that doesn't mean everyone else is.
Which means... What?
Of course!
Makuu's not the one planning something.
He's the target.
Lion Guard, we've gotta find Makuu and save him!
No Makuu, listen!
You're in danger!
Everyone, now!
You're welcome, Makuu.
I'm not sure.
But I have an idea how we can find out.
Animals of the Savannah Summit, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I don't know how to say this, but... It's about Makuu.
Earlier this evening, he fell into a pit.
It was a serious fall.
He tried his best to get out.
He struggled bravely, like a true crocodile.
But...(SIGHS) I'm sorry to say that Makuu has completed his journey through the Circle of Life.
Yeah.
After I almost ruined it.
Great!
Let's go and get it!
It looks like your trap failed, Scar.
We have the ash.
And now we're taking it back to my dad.
Good work, Ono.
We've gotta warn the buffalo!
The herd!
We've gotta stop them before they trample everything in their path!
She can't do it alone.
C'mon!
Wow!
Maybe she can
Great work, Fuli.
Now why don't you take a break?
Ono, take a look.
Ono, what do ya got?
We'd better get moving.
Good thing you didn't need any backup.
You left us in the dust.
Bunga, wait!
Where are you going?
What is up today?
Sounds like somebody else is in trouble.
Thanks, Ono!
Fuli?
Fuli.
Why didn't you wait for us?
Yeah, but we're a team.
And our team's not as good if you get hurt or worn out from going solo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I think you need to rest.
If anything else happens, we'll need you at full strength.
I mean it, Fuli.
You need to take it easy for a while.
I want you to stay here.
Wouldn't expect you to.
So, Bunga.
These utamu grubs.
Do you know where to find them?
Okay, Bunga, which way do we go?
Really?
Why's that?
Pretty cool that you knew that.
Really?
I never knew that.
Don't worry, Bunga.
We'll help you get that utamu.
Right, guys?
Yeah.
But it's good that she's getting some rest.
Careful, Bunga!
That tree looks pretty dead!
Bunga, that branch is rotten!
I don't think it'll hold you!
He's gonna need our help.
Ono, steady the end of that branch.
Beshte, hold the trunk.
That's never good.
We need to check it out.
Ono, Beshte, Bunga, let's go!
Incoming, Beshte!
Sorry, Bunga.
But we gotta go see what Mzingo and his vultures are up to.
Ono, keep an eye out for Fuli.
We'll need her if there's trouble.
No sign of Fuli, Ono?
We sure could use her on this one.
Heyvi kabisa!
Vultures!
Get away from her!
(GROWLS) Mzingo!
When you and your vultures take on one member of the Guard... You take on us all!
You okay?
You shouldn't.
We're always there for each other.
We're a team!
How'd you find me?
Or pretty lucky!
Only because I let you.
Where's Udugu?
I've never heard of it.
You will?
Uh, sure.
I know Bunga will love it.
Don't get too used to him.
See you when I'm back from Udugu.
What do you think's waiting for us in Udugu?
Little brother?
 I'm leader of the Lion Guard!
If they'd wanna meet anyone, it's me.
You're gonna lose.
I run with Fuli every day.
I'll get to Udugu first!
Mom, how much longer will it take to get to Udugu?
We'll see about that!
You really think you can find Udugu before me?
Thanks, mom.
Is this really the trail to Udugu?
Yeah!
I can crawl under the branches to get through the thorns.
(GRUNTS) Ouch!
What's wrong, Kiara?
Isn't your... (GRUNTING) ... plan working?
This is definitely... (GRUNTS)... the right way, Kiara.
I'm almost through!
We'll find her.
We just have
I know, I just... I can't find her either.
If we knew where this Udugu place was, maybe we could meet her there.
Kiara, look!
Paw prints.
They look fresh.
We must be getting close.
Hevi kabisa!
Where did Mom go?
This can't be right.
Mom couldn't just disappear.
Maybe it doesn't.
One, two, three!
If Mom could get up there, we can too.
I've got it!
I'll give you a boost, then you can keep tracking her.
One of us has to boost the other, and the truth is... You're the better tracker.
So we make a good team.
And that's how we'll find Mom, by working together.
Now up you go.
Whoa!
I gotcha!
Hang on.
How's that?
We did it!
Kiara, what's going on?
(CHUCKLES) Mom!
Mom, why did you disappear?
I thought you were gonna show us the way to Udugu.
Is it that big rock?
We did?
What's going on over there?
I don't know.
If there was, you'd think they'd come to us.
Ma Tembo?
What's going on?
Why are you running?
Ono?
See if you can see why.
They must be running to something!
Let's find out what!
Come on!
Ono, check it out!
Yeah, they're pretty impressive.
Who are these guys?
I know!
Since they're visitors in the Pride Lands, I think it's my duty to say hello.
Don't you?
Welcome to the Pride Lands.
I'm Kion, I really enjoyed the show.
You should come to Pride Rock and perform for my mom and dad!
Yeah, sure.
We have to finish our patrol, anyway.
See you!
Come on, everyone.
Let's go.
Nope.
It was pretty amazing.
Sounds like Ma Tembo!
Come on!
What is it, Ma Tembo?
What's wrong?
Hevyi kabisa!
It's more than not fair, Beshte!
It goes against the Circle of Life.
Don't worry, Ma Tembo.
The Lion Guard will figure out who did this and make sure it doesn't happen again!
I doubt it.
An elephant could, maybe, with his trunk.
Bunga, a zebra couldn't reach the high leaves and flowers.
Okay, so what does this all mean?
(CHUCKLING) We know that, Bunga.
Hey!
What if this isn't just one animal?
What if it's a group of animals who like to eat different things, all working together?
I'd like to, but we need to figure out who took all the food.
Hmm.
Well... Sorry, Ono.
I think Bunga has a point.
Maybe we should check out the audience.
I don't see why not.
I guess we'd better follow them.
See you there, Ono
You sure?
Suit yourself.
You know where to find us if you see anything.
Where's Bunga?
Well?
Who is it?
Beshte, go shake that tree.
Lion Guard!
After them!
We'll need to pull 'em out!
Forget the baboons!
Come on.
Beshte!
Bunga!
You know what to do!
Fuli, you're with me!
At least we got them out of the Pride Lands.
Not our problem anymore.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
Don't worry about it, Ono.
It's not like we'll ever see them again!
The Outlands isn't our territory Ono.
Yeah.
You're right, Ono.
Lion Guard!
We gotta save 'em.
Wouldn't expect you to, Fuli.
Now let's go!
Thanks, Ono!
Lead the way!
Stop right there, Janja!
Step away from the baboons!
Lion Guard.
Time to save those baboons.
Now!
Had enough, Janja?
Fine.
Then beat it!
I've got an idea.
Thanks, Beshte.
I think she agrees with you, Bunga!
What about you, Ono?
Changed your mind about the baboons?
Go, Ono!
I know about time.
Anga how long will it take to go around the lake?
Well then let’s get going.
I think Bunga's right.
That looks like the fastest way to go now come on.
Everyone run for it.
Anga can you reach her?
Well then it's up to us Fuli.
Don't worry Makini we'll save you.
Yeah now let's get off this ice.
Uh Makini I think I want some tuliza.
So we don't have any tuliza?
It's alright at least now we're close to the last Moja Kwa Moja Stone.
Right Anga?
But you remember Rafiki's map don't you Ono?
If this is the last Moja Kwa Moja Stone then the Tree of Life must be nearby.
Hey thanks Ono.
Anga do you see a pass in the mountain?
Alright everyone let's head for that mountain pass.
Fuli I am not going to get any better just waiting here now come on let's go.
Come on everyone let's keep moving.
No Bunga don't.
Oh no Bunga look out.
Uh oh it's a rock slide everyone scatter.
Heyvi Kabisa now the whole mountain pass is blocked off.
Bunga why didn't you just listen to me the first time?
Bunga where are you?
And we're so close.
Alright?
We've just blocked the only way to the Tree of Life.
Everyone we have to clear these rocks now.
Come on.
Let's keep going and once we clear these rocks nothing will stop us from getting to the Tree of Life.
I don't know who you are but we've come too far to let you stop us now.
This is my Roar.
Fuli?
Yes I guess I was.
What who are you?
The Night Pride?
Thanks, Rani my names Kion.
My friends and I have been on a very long journey.
We need to get to the Tree of Life to get help.
I need help.
But I need help.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it my friends and I came all this way.
We've been through so many challenges many of them being myself at times.
But we got through it all and when we finally arrived at our destination I ruined it and I showed myself as a threat to the Night Pride.
Oh what's the use?
I blew it.
I'm never going to get healed.
I'm glad you're out Bunga but I don't think we can go to the Tree of Life.
Because I lost control of the Roar again.
Maybe the leader of the Night Pride is right maybe it's not safe to let me go the Tree of Life.
I'm sorry I took you on this journey you stuck with me through it all and then we finally get here, I ruined everything.
You know what Ono?
You're right we won't give up because my scar isn't the only thing that needs healing.
Yes.
And I need to apologize to you all.
I'm sorry for using my Roar.
And I understand precisely if you won't allow me to enter.
But could you let my friend Ono complete the journey to the Tree of Life?
He wasn't part of the earlier fight.
And his eyes need healing.
Please?
Oh, thank you.
I won't.
I promise.
That's why we're here.
Besthe you take Ora.
Fuli you take Chuluun.
Anga and Ono you know what to do.
That leaves just you and me Makucha.
Oh Bunga.
No we've agreed to help patrol the Tree of Life during the day.
So right now that's what we'll do.
No not yet.
Fuli I want you to take charge today.
There's something I gotta do.
Askari I'm back.
I'd like to continue my training.
I understand and I'm willing to let the Roar go.
I know I don't need to lead the Lion Guard.
Thank you.
I've had some help learning to stay calm, and I want to learn more.
Hi, Bunga.
Hard to explain.
(CHUCKLES) How can you tell?
Anga?
What's up?
Go on.
I'll be right behind you.
Thank you, Askari.
I'm ready.
I can handle this.
If that's okay.
Stay calm.
Focus.
Bunga.
Get ready.
Beshte.
This one's for you.
Oh right.
Me neither.
Everything okay, Fuli?
Yeah.
I think I'm okay.
I'd like to convince them to never attack the Tree of Life.
Far, far away.
It was the least I can do.
After all, I was the one who lead them here.
What's next, Bunga?
(SIGHS) Of course we'll help you.
Stay here.
We'll go get the leopard out of your tree.
Sounds good?
You and the other galagos will be safe here.
A lot safer than if you're with us, when we take on the leopard.
Now what?
Ono!
Come on!
Lion Guard, let's go!
And we will.
Right after we help the giraffe.
Then we'll come back here for you.
Don't worry, Shingo.
We're on it.
Bunga, you'll need to climb up there and help pull Shingo free.
Laini?
I told you to wait at Hakuna Matata Falls!
What happened?
Beshte's right, Laini.
You and the galagos should go back to the falls.
It's safer there.
Okay, galagos.
We'll be right over there at your tree.
Stay here.
Don't worry, so am I.
(WHISPERING) Surround the tree.
When he wakes up, we want to be ready.
Ono!
Now!
They're the animals who live here.
You took their home.
They're a little scared of you.
What about your home?
You're a leopard.
Don't you have your own territory?
The galagos are right, Badili.
You need to go back home.
Badili, is there a reason you don't want to go home?
And you did.
But now it's time to go back where you belong.
Right.
Laini, we're taking Badili home now.
The grove is all yours.
Time to go.
Badili, what's goin' on?
You keep making excuses like you don't want to go home.
Wait, Bunga.
Something's not right.
Come on.
Not yet.
Maybe he needs someone to stick up for him.
I've got a better idea!
You get out!
This isn't your turf.
He is a leopard.
And this is his turf.
That means you have to go back where you came from!
You don't have to thank us at all, Badili.
This is what we do.
It's okay to be scared.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
And he's gone for good.
He knows the Lion Guard has your back.
Our pleasure, Badili.
Maybe we'll see you again sometime.
Thanks, Ono.
Looks like we'll finish our patrol early today.
Hmm.
You know, I think we made a big mistake.
We never should have gotten rid of Mapigano.
We're not helping Badili by scaring that other leopard away for him.
We need to teach you how to stand up for yourself.
What do you think, Badili?
Ready to face Mapigano?
And how do you know he's not scary?
Better believe it.
Now go take back your turf.
Wouldn't miss it for the whole savannah.
I believe in Badili.
He can do this himself.
You believed in yourself.
That's what really counts.
And now that you have your turf back, we can let the galagos know it's safe to go home.
Ukumbusho.
It's a performance that celebrates the friendship between the elephants and the lions of the Pride Lands.
Looking good, Ma Tembo.
Absolutely.
Right, you guys?
(DEEPLY) Can't elephants and lions live together in peace?
Can't elephants and lions live together in peace?
I know it seems kinda rough now...
Think of what, Ma Tembo?
I already look like a lion.
I've definitely never seen anything like it.
You know what?
You all look terrific.
Good work, Makini.
I know you're all gonna do great at the Ukumbusho tonight.
Ugh!
That's one impressive roar.
Are you new to the Pride Lands, lion?
What's going on?
Do you really need a sunburst?
Hey, we're going to figure this out.
We won't let some yellow paint ruin the Ukumbusho.
What if she made more yellow paint?
Okay.
Good.
In the meantime... Mtoto's mom, you go rehearse with Bunga.
Don't worry, Ma Tembo.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Good going, Makini.
No, it doesn't.
The whole performance is about peace.
Everybody ready?
Let's do it.
So many paths to peace
Many dry seasons ago,Askari, leader of the first Lion Guard, made peace with the elephants.
Working together, the lions and elephants made the Pride Lands a safe home for everyone who respects the Circle of Life.
It is this peace that we celebrate tonight.
Told you it will all work out.
Greetings, wise elephants!
My name is Askari.
I am first leader of the Pride Lands Lion Guard.
You have nothing to fear from us.
(BUZZING) What is that?
I am not sure what's going on.
But elephants on a rampage could hurt someone!
Or themselves!
C'mon.
We gotta stop 'em.
Elephants!
Calm down!
So the bees stopped chasing you... But they're still after the other elephants.
And they're wearing the yellow paint that Makini made from flowers.
We have to wash that pollen off the elephants!
Fuli, go warn the buffalo!
We'll stay on the elephants.
May be it didn't work on the bees, but it might work on the paint.
All right.
Now we just gotta take care of the others.
Actually, that might not be a bad thing.
It was the pollen in the paint.
And once Mtoto blew it off, the bees weren't attracted to you any more.
Beshte!
Ma Tembo!
Mtoto!
You did it!
Don't worry, Mtoto.
We'll help her.
There she is!
Mtoto!
Stop!
All those trees she knocked down were holding the hill in place.
That sounds awful.
Actually, I know it's not tradition, but maybe we should consider finishing the Ukumbusho without any paint?
Greetings, wise elephants!
My name is Askari.
I am first leader of the Pride Lands Lion Guard.
You have nothing to fear from us.
Uh ohit's sound like's they're in trouble.
Hey Ono do you see anything?
Let's check it out come on.
Tiifu Zuri what's wrong?
Do you hear that?
I think we should go.
Something's not right, Bunga.
We have to get out of here.
Come on.
Move away!
Get back.
Hurry!
Bunga.
Fire break.
Kiara, Tiifu, Zuri.
Take cover in the mud.
Okay.
But Tiifu and Zuri, the mud pots.
Let's go.
Muhangus' burrow.
Quick.
Everyone into the aardvark hole.
Move!
Now!
Is everyone okay?
We got lucky.
We can stay right here and wait out the fire.
I don't know.
All day, maybe.
Tiifu, stop!
You can't go back up there.
The fire's still burning.
Kiara!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kiara?
Tiifu?
Are you okay?
It's okay to be afraid, Tiifu.
We understand.
Don't worry.
We'll find another way out.
We just need to figure out which one of these tunnels to try.
But we'll be right there with you.
And we won't let anything happen to you.
Okay?
Let's try this one.
I don't know.
Come on, stop.
(LAUGHS) That tickles.
But I thought these were all aardvark tunnels.
So those vibrations you feel.
Is that how you'll get us out of here?
Thanks, Kuchimba.
Kuchimba.
Wait!
Kuchimba!
Kuchimba!
We have a problem.
I don't know.
Hoof steps.
Maybe we're getting close to the surface.
How'd you get here?
Does that tunnel lead to the surface?
Come on.
We'll help you get back to the Pride Lands too.
Any chance you remember which one of those tunnels you came down?
Of course.
Muhangus.
We came in through his den.
He's got to be down here somewhere.
If we can find him, he can lead us out.
Ready for some tracking?
I smell it too.
It's faint, but it's there.
Let's go.
And Muhangus is somewhere on the other side.
We just have to dig our way to him.
Tiifu.
I promise that won't happen.
We'll be back.
Muhangus?
Muhangus?
Not at all.
We're sorry.
It's just, we got lost down here with our friends.
We were hoping you could help.
Yep.
And he's gonna help us get out of here.
Then I think you'll like what's up ahead.
Look.
It's okay.
You don't have to... You don't have to panic.
Definitely.
You saved the day.
We're fine.
It's kind of a long story.
Not yet.
It could make another bridge.
Wow!
Nice one, Beshte!
This way, elands!
This way!
Right.
We need
Come on we've got another dust devil.
Come on hurry.
They don't last long but they sure make a mess.
Well something tells me that we're going to be chasing these things all day.
That's right Ono keep an eye out.
I know what you're thinking but we should at least check it out.
Is there a problem with that?
Oh I wish we could be nobody knows when a dust devils going to happen or where it's going to go.
Well we gotta go now thank you for your advise.
Alright Lion Guard let's move.
What's going on you two?
Stop it!
Yeah.
I wonder what they were really up to.
Lion Guard, let's go.
Heyvi kabisa!
What happened to you guys?
Don't worry.
Goigoi?
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.
Just doing our job.
Okay, everybody, time for a break.
What do you want?
(EXCLAIMS) What in the Pride Lands?
That's why you're trying to rub out tummies?
That's it!
All those crazy attacks.
Scar's got to be up to something.
But what?
'Cause those guys don't do anything unless somebody smarter tells them to do so.
Maybe he's up to something really big, and he's just trying to keep us distracted.
Did you recognize the zebra?
I know what you're thinking, Fuli.
But its good advice.
You asked for it.
Like how flowers make us sneeze?
Come on, let's go home.
We heard you shouting.
Good thing we were close by.
Okay.
Well, time for one more patrol before Christmas.
Bunga, you coming?
Well, maybe we can.
We're the Lion Guard.
We do the impossible all the time.
Okay.
Bunga, what do we need for The Twelve Ways of Christmas?
Maybe you should start from the beginning.
Sounds like a big job, but if we split up, I think we can do it.
We'll divide up the things and animals we have to gather, and meet back at Hakuna Matata Falls.
Oh, come on, Dad, please?
It's for Timon and Pumbaa.
Thanks, Dad.
Actually, we need all of you.
And Tiifu and Zuri, too.
Thanks, everybody.
Now I gotta go.
You won't believe all the things we need for this song!
And Merry Christmas!
Hey, you made it.
Uh, not exactly.
Come on!
That was great.
Thanks, everyone.
Bunga, we've been practicing all night long.
Wait.
Everybody, stop!
We can't just give up like this.
What's wrong, Bunga?
Well... Who's that?
Sure, Bunga.
We came as soon as we could.
I know one thing that'll scare them away from the aardvarks' den for good.
Lion Guard, follow me!
I see 'em...
Everyone, stay behind me.
Hey!
I told you before, and I meant it.
Get.
Out.
The Pride Lands!
(ROARS)
And stay out.
No kidding.
Here, Bunga.
All yours.
What is it, Ono?
A tree falling apart?
That's not really an emergency.
You were right to get us, Ono.
Come on, everybody.
What's the fastest way, Ono?
Got it!
Heyvi kabisa!
Whatever it was, we can talk about it later.
We still have to help the Mekundu bats!
Come on!
Whoa!
The whole thing's coming down!
We gotta wake up the bats!
I don't hear anything.
Uh-oh!
Look out!
You're right.
There's a lot of them.
Maybe they ate through the tree bridge, too.
I bet that's why it collapsed!
We have to tell my dad.
Um, yeah.
The thing is, we don't know why there are so many termites.
Yeah.
We better talk to the aardwolves and make sure they're okay.
Where do they live?
Uh, Dad?
What exactly do aardwolves look like?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Dad, I... I think I kicked the aardwolves out of the Pride Lands.
It was a mistake.
I thought they were hyenas.
Thanks, guys.
But I'm the one who used the Roar on them.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
We're gonna make things right.
I promise!
Lion Guard, we're gonna find those aardwolves, and bring them back to the Pride Lands!
(SIGHS) Don't rub it in.
I'm just glad we got their scent from the aardvark dens so we can track them.
(SNIFFS) It's the aardwolves' scent.
And it's getting stronger.
(SNIFFS)
I don't know, Beshte.
All I know is that we've gotta convince 'em to come back to the Pride Lands!
Now come on!
Aardwolves!
Wow.
They're pretty fast.
You okay?
Wait.
They're afraid of us.
Well, I did use the Roar on them.
Maybe they think we're out to get them.
Yeah, but they don't know that.
So we've gotta convince them we're the good guys.
Of course, we've gotta find them again first.
We want you to come back to the Pride Lands!
Look, I'm really sorry.
That was a mistake.
I Roared at you because we thought you were hyenas.
We still need to find the rest of your pack.
So we can take you all home.
Uh, hey!
Wait for us!
Okay.
This time, we need a good plan.
Mjomba, will you go into that cave?
Tell the other aardwolves we're not a threat?
Just pop your head out when you know they won't run.
Then we can all go back to the Pride Lands.
Something's not right.
Why'd they do that?
I promised we'd make things right.
Come on!
Ono.
Can you see through the crack?
Get away from the aardwolf, Reirei!
I'll bet you do, Rairai.
Anybody got Goigoi?
All right, Rairai.
Time for you to go home!
Okay, Bunga!
Best idea I've heard all day.
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
Is there any sign of Ono?
What'd you see, Ono?
It's okay, Ono.
I'm just glad you made it back in one piece.
We need to stay alert.
Scar could make his next move any time now.
There's only one way to find out.
Come on!
Everyone, Slow down.
Is everyone calmer now?
The rock.
Okay.
Let's go check it out.
The rock talked?
Twiga?
What's wrong?
You don't have to... Okay.
Everyone just stay calm.
Please.
We'll go check it out.
Unless she really did.
No, but... I think Twiga heard something.
Where'd you come from?
I think we just found our talking rock.
 Where'd she go?
Hey, wait up!
We just want to talk!
What's your name, chameleon?
And why did you run from us?
Sorry if we scared you, Kinyonga.
We just wanted to know why you were spooking Twiga and the zebras.
It's nice to meet you, Kinyonga.
But please be careful when you're camouflaged.
Thank you.
We've got enough to deal with trying to figure out what the Outlanders are gonna do next.
It's okay, Ono.
I know it's not easy to slip into the Outlands without being seen.
I don't think so.
You know about Scar?
Scar's inside the volcano.
There are bad guys all over the place.
What if one of them spots you?
We really do need to know what Scar's up to.
You promise to be careful?
And be back before sunset!
I know.
Ono, take a look?
Heyvi kabisa!
Easy, Bunga.
We need to save Kinyonga, not start a battle.
But I think I know how to get into the Outlands without being seen.
Hey you leave the chameleon alone, skinks.
Are you okay?
Then we've got no time to lose.
Let's go.
They just met a talking rock.
Can't you see?
I'm the one who's about to kick your tail.
Keep going, Janja!
Thanks, Kinyonga.
Huh!
I wonder where she went.
I hope she shows up.
I want to thank her again for all the help she gave us last night.
Kinyonga!
Where'd you go last night?
Not your fault.
Lion Guard, let's round 'em up.
Again.
