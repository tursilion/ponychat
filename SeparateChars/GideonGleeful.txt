Hello America!
My name is Li'l Gideon.
Why, Stanford.
I'm just a humble tomato farmer, selling his wares.
Whoops, I dropped one.
Whoops, I dropped another one.
Why, hello Stanford.
Who's cute as a button, and always your friend?
Lil' G-I-D to the E-O-N!
Wink!
I have a big announcement to make today, and I'd like to cordially invite all the good people of Gravity Falls to join me.
Free admission to anyone who wears their Gideon pins!
It's my face!
Minor setback?
Minor setback!
You listen daddy and you'll listen good.
Prison is a nightmare!
I eat the same slop everyday!
They have no hair products in here!
I can't sleep 'cause my cellmate took my pillow for a wife!
You think I've been having fun in here?
Ladies and gentlemen, it is such a gift to have you here tonight! 
...Such a gift.
I have a vision.
I predict that you will soon all say, aww.
Hit it, Dad!
Oh, I can see, what others can't see
Keep it going!
I sense that you've been here before.
I'll read your mind if I'm able
So welcome all ye... to the Tent of Telepathy
Oh... oh my goodness.
Thank you!
You people are the real miracles!
Yeah, my song's quite catchy.
Now, I know we haven't formally met, but after yesterday's performance, I just couldn't get your laugh out of my head.
Oh, what a delight!
Now, when I saw you in the audience, I said to myself, Now there's a kindred spirit!
Someone who appreciates the sparkly things in life.
Enchanting.
Utterly enchanting.
I appreciate your discretion.
Now, Stan's no fan of mine.
I don't know how a lemon so sour could be related to a peach so sweet.
What do you say we step away from here, and chat a bit more.
Perhaps in my dressing room?
Ya see something you like?
'Cause I do.
Mabel, when I'm up here lookin' down on all those little ol' people, I feel like I'm king of all I survey.
I guess that makes you my queen!
I can't quit it.
I am speaking from the heart.
Mabel, I've never felt this close with anyone.
So, so close.
At least just give me a chance.
Mabel, will you do me the honor of going on a date with me?
Mmnn.
It'll just be one li'l ol' date, I swear on my lucky bolo tie.
Mabel Pines, you have made me the happiest boy in the world!
A night of enchantment awaits, m'lady!
Well, people have a hard time saying no to me.
Jean Luc, what did we discuss about eye contact?
Parlez vous francais?
...And so I said Autograph your own head shot lady.
Mabel, tonight's date was a complete success.
And tomorrow's date promises to top this one in every way!
Hark!
What a surprise!
A red crested South American rainbow macaw!
...two three four...
They're expectin' us.
Please say you'll go.
Don't you want this evenin' to last, my sweet?
How about soul mate?
Dipper Pines, how are you?
You look good, you look good.
So what you're sayin' is... you've... come between us.
Of course not.
These things happen.
Bygones, you know.
Thumbs up indeed, my friend.
Dipper Pines, you don't know what you've done!
You've just made the biggest mistake of your life!
I CAN BUY AND SELL YOU, OLD MAN!
Hello friend.
Dipper Pines.
How long have been livin' in this town?
A week, two?
You like it here?
Enjoy the scenery?
Listen carefully, boy.
This town has secrets you couldn't begin to comprehend!
LIAR!
YOU turned her against me!
She was my peach dumplin'!
Readin' minds isn't all I can do.
Oh tell me, Dipper: is this fake?
Your sister will be mine!
Who's a cute little guy?
You are!
That's a lie.
And I'm gonna make sure you never lie to me again, friend.
M-Mabel.
My marshmalla.
What are you doin' here?
I-I don't understand.
Really?
My tie!
Give it back!
Screams and charges at Dipper, making him drop the amulet and breaking through the window.
MY POWERS!
Oh this isn't over.
This isn't the last you'll see of wittle...
ol' me!
Stanford Pines, I rebuke thee!
I rebuke thee!
The entire Pines' family have invoked my fury!
You will all pay recompense for your transgressions!
SILENCE!
Gideon, I still love you.
If only my family weren't in the way.
Look at me.
I'm old, and I'm smelly.
Hey, what are you gonna do without your precious amulet?
Oh you'll see boy... You'll see...
Stanford, you fool!
You just signed over the Mystery Shack to lil' ol' me!
The shack is hereby signed over to...
SUCK A LEMON LITTLE MAN?
How dare you!
I am not a threat to be taken lightly!
Come here hon', I need your arms.
I'll get you, Stanford Pines!
I'LL GET YOU ALL!
Oh, howdy Stanford!
Listen closely.
Inside this jar I have 1000 Cursed Egyptian super termites.
Hand over the deed to your property or I'll smash this jar with a bat, and they'll devour this shack with you inside!
Oh, no!
Aaaah!
Get it off!
Awww!
Y'all may have won this battle, but mark my words, Stanford!
Your family has a weak spot, and I'm gonna find it!
My hair!
Curse the Pines family!
Curse Stan!
Curse Dipper!
My, my, what delightful manner of a dohickery is this?
Flick, boop, woo hoo hoo.
Gwa ha ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee, woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
That's my widdle secret!
Mouth-breathin' fools...
You two!
Why Mabel, I wouldn't hurt a hair on your itty-bitty head... if you agree to be my queen!
Maybe you'll change your mind after THIS!
As for you, boy... Tell me.
How exactly did you come upon this magic item?
Hmm?
Did somebody tell you about it?
Did you... READ about it somewhere?
Well don't mind if I... AAAAAAAH!
Grrrrr!
I COULD SQUASH YOU RIGHT NOW!
Steel yourself, Gideon.
You can use them.
You can use them...
Stanford Pines, listen to me very closely.
I have your niece and nephew.
Hand over the deed to the Mystery Shack right now, or great harm will befall them!
This is Gideon, by the way.
I have them in my possession!
You don't believe me?
I will text you a photo!
Hello?
Hello?
Arrgh!
Coming!
Guard them, Cheekums.
I'm coming!
Clean me!
Father, could you give widdle old me a ride to the Mystery Shack?
No, no, NO, DON'T TICKLE MEEEE!
Never tickle me!
What have I told you?
What have I told — look at me — what have I told you?
There we go.
I'll just take the BUS!
I'm gonna annihilate my archenemy's entire family.
I'm comin' for ya, Stanford!
Ugh!
One of those infernal Gummy Koalas has gotten into my perfect hair.
I can't defeat Stan looking like this.
Woowee!
Little Dipper.
I dare say you would have defeated me, if it wasn't for your sibling bickering!
The Shack is mine, Stanford Pines!
Well, well, Stanford it appears I finally got the best of... Tell me where Stan is!
Oh Stanford, I'm coming for ya!
You come back here!
Termites!
NOW!
Oh contraire.
It will be you who pays!
Finally after all these years, after every humiliation!
Your business, your family, everything will finally be mine!
You have no one to protect you now!
Prepare for the wrath of Gideon Glee- Gideon glee- oh oh oh ah oh oh ah Uh ey ey ey!
stop it!
Ha, ha, ha!
My light!
Nooo!
It's not just about revenge.
I want that shack, the physical Buildin'.
Because it holds a secret you couldn't possibly imagine.
Did you pick out all the nuts?
A little more.
Ahahahah.
Uhm, that's good.
Oh my, was this your chair.
I had no idea.
Yes I did, Stan, I knew.
First come, first serve!
Ooh!
My cheeks are baby soft.
Deal with it.
Stanford!
Well, guess you've won.
Put 'er there.
Unless perhaps I predicted your plan, and coated the entire chair with glue last night!
Enjoy your chair... forever.
Oh, heavens to Betsy!
Well, well, Stanford, my arch-nemesis.
We seem to have entered a dangerous game of cat and mouse.
But the question remains, who is the cat, and who is the-
Oh no, not the broom!
You mark my words, Stanford, one day I'm gonna get that combination.
And once I steal that deed, you'll never see the Mystery Shack again!
Your brain isn't as safe as you might think, Stanford Pines!
This is the last straw!
It's time to unlock the journal's greatest secret...
You think that combination's safe in your mind, Stanford?
We'll see what my new minion has to say about that!
Triangulum, entangulum.
Vene foris dominus mentium.
Vene foris videntis omnium!
Egassem sdrawkcab.
egassem sdrawkcab.
Egassem sdrawkcab!
Egassem sdrawkcab!
Egassem sdrawkcab!
W-what are you?
H-how do you know my name?
You're insane!
Listen to me, demon!
I have a job for you.
I need you to enter the mind of Stanford Pines and steal the code to his safe.
It worked!
Bill!
Did you find the memory with the combination yet?
Ha ha ha!
Perfect.
now give it to me and we'll finish our bargain.
The deal's off!
I'm switchin' to plan B!
Oh, I'm sorry, Pines family.
Did I wake you?
Bill failed me!
So I switched to plan B: dynamite!
Spoiler alert, Stanford!
I've got the deed!
The Mystery Shack belongs to me!
So get out of my property!
Daddy?
Bring it around the front.
Hello, Gravity Falls!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Today I am delighted to announce my plans for the former Mystery Shack.
I give you... Gideonland!
We're gonna turn this dirty ol' shack into three square miles of Gideon-tertainment.
And introducin' our new mascot, Lil' Gideon Jr.
Boom, he's a pig!
Such accusations!
Pines, I recall you gave the property to me.
Look, here's the deed right here!
Now get off my property, old man!
Thanks for visiting Gideonland, friends!
Don't come back, I don't care for y'all.
You!
Back to your corner!
Father, have I ever told you the true nature of this book?
Codes and maps had led me to believe that the other book is buried somewhere on this very property, and I intend to find it!
That's right, father, it's time to begin the search for the other journal!
Am I supposed to say, Or else what?
Very well.
What do you know!
Works on gnomes too!
I am not a girl!
Subdue them!
Could it be?
Is it?
Of course!
It all makes sense!
The one place I'd never think to look!
You had it the whole time!
And to think I actually considered you a threat!
Every victory you had was because of your precious book!
Or you'll what, boy?
You'll what?
Huh?
Huh?
No muscles.
No brains.
Face it!
You're nothin' without this!
Bye bye forever, y'all!
I've got it!
I finally got it!
Get out!
It's finally mine!
At last, I have journal number three?
There are THREE of them?
But where is journal number one?
I must have all three for the power to be unlocked!
But where could I— Dipper!
He must know where it is!
He gave me the third one and kept the first for himself!
I can't let him leave Gravity Falls!
You there!
Is it ready?
Halt!
I command you to halt!
I got you in my sight!
Tell me!
Where is Journal #1?
Don't play games with me, boy!
Ha ha ha, you still think you're some kind of hero?
Once I find the final journal I'll rule this town!
With you as my queen!
Never!
I finally won this time!
It was the Pines twins!
They tried to attack me and blow up my statue with dynamites!
Arrest 'em!
Please, I... It's not what it looks like...
What are you gonna do with me?
Wha... no!
Let go of me!
Watch the hair!
You can't do this to me!
Y'all are sheep!
You need me!
I'll be back!
You'll hear from my lawyers!
I have finger painting at the same time!
Whew!
The mayor dying is my one ticket out of here.
Which is why you're gonna win this election, pardon me out of prison and we're not gonna let the Pines, get in my way again!
Hmm, magic, you say?
Well, maybe it's time to fight fire with fire!
I've been saving this for a long time!
I've been waiting for the right moment.
Well daddy, maybe you just need to have more... of an open mind.
Lleps live ykoops, lleps live ykoops, live ykoops... Wittle ol' me.
Aha!
Hello there, long time no see!
Except in my revenge fantasies where I see you on an hourly basis.
And it seems you've been controlling Stanford!
I figured it the both of y'all.
You've got much eviller since I last saw you.
Daddy!
Behold, your grand view of the debate!
Once I win this election, I'll finally rule this backwoods town!
Oh, I'd be happy to spare you Mabel.
If you agree to be mine.
I even made you this wedding dress in crafts class!
Don't ask what it's made of.
Fine!
Have it your way.
Once I win, they'll hit the plunger for the fireworks display, finishing the mountain's construction, trapping y'all inside.
I've been trapped behind concrete all summer, now see how you like it!
Say hello to the next mayor of Gravity Falls, kids!
Muwahahahahahaha!
Thanks, Ghost-Eyes.
I'm just not in the mood.
This poster is the only thing keeping me going.
I'm finally ready to make a deal.
Oh, Ghost-Eyes, you're making me blush!
Oh my.
Bill came through.
Oh, but that's where you're wrong!
Hands where I can see 'em.
Y'all fellers ain't goin' nowhere.
That's Sheriff Gideon!
Under the authority of Bill Cipher, I place you two under arrest!
Oh, hi, Wendy!
Have we formally met?
Wooooo-we!
Look what the apocalypse dragged in!
Y'all are in a twelve-piece bucket of deep fried trouble now!
Ghost-Eyes!
Spitoon!
Ma' old pal Bill figured you might try to rescue Mabel.
So he appointed me, master of these wastelands, and keeper of the bubble!
My sweet precious Mabel's trapped inside and I HAVE THE ONLY KEY!
Wrapped around my... well I wouldn't call it a neck exactly, wrapped around this little pocket of fat under ma' head?
Bill explained it to me nice and simple: she was always destined to be mine!
And now that I have her in a cage she'll learn to love me!
I have an eternity to wait!
Ghost-Eyes!
Ready to escort our friends to Bill's dungeon?
And why's that?
Oho, and what makes you think you can do all that?
Ghost-Eyes!
My hench-angel!
You'll never get away with this, ya hear me?
After them!
Yes, please.
We are not letting 'em get Mabel!
Discount Auto-mart Warriors, rollout!
Swerve swerve!
I can't let 'em free Mabel!
SHE LOVES ME!
She just doesn't know it yet.
Now quit the philosophy.
Weirdness bubbles blockin' the path!
WOOOOWEE we got 'em now.
Wooowee.
I dare say y'all almost had the jump on me there for a second.
But this ain't your Gravity Falls anymore!
Out here, I win.
Bill's henchbats will be here any minute to retrieve y'all.
MABEL'S MINE NOW!
Hahahaha!
Well, yeah.
I have her trapped, ergo, Mabel is MINE!
Oh, I'm worthy o' lovin'!
These prisoners love me!
That's crazy!
You know what Bill would do to me if that happens?
No, I ju... it's a complicated situation.
Dipper. Will you tell her what I did?
I hope you're right about this.
Guys, new plan!
Bill's minions are gonna be on us in seconds.
But I'm not gonna let that dumb triangle be the warden o' me!
Y'all ready for a good old fashioned prison brawl?
Lets do this!
Henchmen, rollout!
I know!
Bill captured me.
He's been forcing me to do cute dances in this cage for all eternity.
I'm so tired of being cute!
Mayor Tyler.
He's the load-bearing human.
Pull him out, and the whole thing goes down.
No more SAILOR SUIT!
Whoo!
An excuse to stand next to Mabel.
Oh, I won't!
I will.
Dang it, old man!
Now's not the time!
You've gone too far, Cipher!
Thanks to y'all savin' us, I'm gonna learn to open my heart to kindness.
No more evil-doin'.
From now on, I'm gonna try to be Li'l Gideon, regular ol' kid.
Wa--oh!
Woo!
I'm bustin' a move on this skatin' board.
Face it kid, you're nothing without that journal.
How are you gonna fight then?
No muscles.
No brains.
What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do!
It was written many years ago by a brilliant unknown author who learned secrets too powerful for one man.
Because he knew that if the journals were ever bought together, they would unleash a gateway to unimaginable power.
