I am just a simple author telling it like it is.
Who should I make it out to?
I'm afraid that's all we have time for today.
[chuckles]
But please take a free copy of my book on your way out.
Get away with what?
I am merely telling my side of the story.
You think everything in A.
Yearling's books are true?
In Daring Do and the Quetzal's Quest, she states that the Fangthorn Flowers are red when in fact they are blue!
Still, if that is wrong, is it not possible that other, bigger things are, too?
Take a look.
It's in my book.
[sighs dramatically]
It is terrible being misunderstood.
It is true in the past I have not been as nice to Daring Do as I should.
But I have my reasons!
My team and I were only ever interested in researching artifacts and taking them to our museum where...
[narrating]
...other ponies could study them.
But Daring Do always seemed to get there first with her own plans.
I offered to team up with her, but she refused.
She had her own ideas of where the treasures belonged.
Only because I had to.
[narrating]
Since Daring Do kept taking our artifacts, our museum closed.
We were desperate for money to keep it open.
And I felt it was my duty to tell the world.
Thank you for listening and understanding, Miss...
