I haven't forgotten what you've promised me.
I will bring you my sister, Emperor Belos.
Kikimora!
Rest assured, Kiki.
I have everything under control.
Today, we capture Eda, once and for all.
Good.
That infernal house demon is asleep.
Surround the house!
Thank you, students.
Good luck with puberty.
I am at your service, Emperor Belos.
I... I understand.
I will not fail.
Lilith, think!
You've given your entire life to this coven, you can't lose it.
What's Eda's weakness?
She has no attachment, no friends.
Think!
Why, if it isn't Eda's human pet.
How perfect.
Aren't I lucky to find you here.
That's the plan.
Now, that doesn't belong to you.
Huh.
These decrepit relics are useless.
If you wanna see your friend again, deliver this to Edalyn.
Come on, Edalyn.
You would be late when I need you most.
Sister!
I see that you got my invitation to a Witch's Duel!
Easy now.
The human is safe.
You can have her back, provided you do as I say.
Renounce your wild ways and join the Emperor's Coven.
He can help heal your curse!
Then I will take you in by force.
It's sad to see you slowing down sister.
Tell me, is it the curse?
Maybe you are stronger than me, but that made me work smarter!
I became smart, crafty!
You always thought you were better than me, that I could never beat you in anything.
Then why were you so easy to curse?
A-And I have the power to remove it, if you would just let me explain.
Human.
That orb was for your protection.
Come along, sister.
Now we can let the healing begin.
Leave, human!
Edalyn is finally with her family.
Her real family.
Go back to your world.
This one is ours.
Thank you, all.
It wasn't easy for me to rise to the top.
I also started from humble beginnings.
Now I have the highest honor of enforcing the Emperor's will.
So be more!
The Emperor's Coven awaits you!
Sister?
It's been so long since I've seen you last!
What are you wearing?
You look like some sort of trash collector.
Oh, right.
You are.
That... That's all for today.
You shouldn't even be here.
You're a wanted criminal!
Unless... I don't believe it!
You are here to join the Emperor's Coven!
You think being covenless makes you so much smarter than everyone else.
But while you run from the law like a degenerate, I'm mentoring the next generation of powerful witch students into the world.
Is that a challenge?
Mmm, it seems your student has met my strongest protégé.
And look at those ears!
Is she human?
Where did you even find one of these?
Okay, Edalyn.
For one day, you won't have to hide from the law, because I want to see how good a teacher you really are.
Beloved citizens, the Emperor's Coven proudly presents an impromptu demonstration of the sort of witch we seek every year.
Introducing Amity Blight.
Versus... some human girl.
Oh, Eda.
I do believe this means you lose!
I only did that because I knew you would cheat!
Knock it off.
You're making a scene!
Stop acting like a child!
Rhyme one more thing.
I dare you!
That's it!
Ow, ow, ow-ow-ow. Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
Enough of this.
I'll admit I was surprised when I first saw you today.
You make it so hard to want to help you, Edalyn.
I will capture her, ma'am.
You have my word.
Your days are numbered, Edalyn.
Word reached me that you captured my sister.
I'll take it from here.
The orders have changed.
Hello, Edalyn.
Your show of affection is touching.
Do you know why you're here?
Sister, the charges against you are long and many.
Operating a stand without a permit, owning a hocus without a pocus...
These charges are serious.
There's no more running away, Edalyn.
But we can.
You getting caught was clearly a cry for help.
Join the Emperor's Coven, like we dreamed about when we were girls.
Don't be afraid, sister.
Soon, you won't be a danger to those around you.
Bring out the branding glove.
After her!
There she is.
Sister.
Time and again I've offered you my help, yet you foolishly run back to your worthless life.
I'm tired of trying, Edalyn.
Your days of running are over!
Eda, you rotten sister!
Switch me back!
Why are you in your old uniform?
Edalyn Clawthorne, you are hereby under arrest by the order of the Emperor of the Boiling Isles.
Come on!
I have to bring you in.
It’s time for you to join the coven.
The Emperor has big plans for the Isles, and he wants you to be a part of it all.
What are you even looking at?
Grudgby pictures?
Feeling sentimental?
Oh, Edalyn.
Not only is the curse affecting your hair, but your memory as well.
Really?
Hmm... Game on.
Remember, dear sister, you may have been star player, but I was team captain for a reason.
Taking your time.
Nervous?
I can’t go back to the Emperor empty-handed.
I will be back for you.
And next time, I won’t be alone.
Eda, stop that this instant!
Don't look at me like that.
This is for your own good.
Emperor Belos will heal you, and we'll be in his coven together.
Isn't that wonderful?
I will not fall prey to your childish games.
Eda, no!
My Lord, I apologize for my sister's rash behavior.
She is still in her cursed form.
Once you've healed her, as promised, I am sure she will become a useful asset to the coven!
Ah, taking her to the healing ceremony?
But, you, promised me.
Of course... worry not, Kikimora.
I shall capture the human.
Drat!
I'm too late, at least I found you, human.
I just wanna talk!
Ah, stop!
What is wrong with you?
Please, just listen to me!
You're right.
I deserve to be in Edalyn's place.
When Edalyn and I were younger, we were, the best of friends.
Being in the Emperor's Coven was my dream.
I wanted to work alongside the most powerful witch on the Isles and make the world a better place.
Eda wanted to be with me, but there was a problem.
I knew Edalyn would beat me.
She was younger, but worked twice as hard.
She met me at my level.
Emperor Belos always said, To be great, you have to make sacrifices.
What would he do in my situation?
I found a spell that would take away her powers.
I thought it would just be for a day.
I made my sacrifice for the emperor, and it was time to receive my reward.
I've been pursuing Edalyn because if she joined the Emperor's coven, Emperor Belos told me he would heal her curse.
But he lied to me.
I know how to rescue Edalyn, but I can't do it alone.
Thank you.
Now, lets head back.
You can take this up to the stage where they're holding Edalyn.
I will stay in the Emperor's coven, but I will make sure nothing like this ever happen again.
Hello, Edalyn.
If I knew something like this would happen, Edalyn, I... Edalyn!
The spell wasn't completed!
Maybe I can help her fight it!
No, human.
No amount of elixir can heal her now.
Oh, sister.
I should have done this a long time ago.
With this spell declared, let the pain be shared.
I feel that I've been weakened as well.
