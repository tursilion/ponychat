Ah, summer break.
A time for leisure, recreation, and taking 'er easy.
Unless you're me.
My name is Dipper.
The girl about to puke is my sister Mabel.
You may be wondering what we're doing in a golf cart, fleeing from a creature of unimaginable horror.
Rest assured, there's a perfectly logical explanation.
Let's rewind.
It all began when our parents decided we could use some fresh air.
They shipped us up north to a sleepy town called Gravity Falls, Oregon, to stay at our great-uncle's place in the woods.
And there's a goat on my bed.
My sister tended to look on the bright side of things.
But I was having a hard time getting used to our new surroundings.
And then there was our Great Uncle Stan.
This guy.
Our uncle had transformed his house into a tourist trap he called The Mystery Shack.
The real mystery was why anyone came.
And guess who had to work there.
It looked like it was gonna be the same, boring routine all summer.
Until one fateful day...
Mabel, I know you're going through your whole Boy Crazy phase, but I think you're kind of overdoing it with the crazy part.
Yeah, but do you need to flirt with every guy you meet?
Ha ha ha!
Not it!
Aw, what?
Grunkle Stan, whenever I'm in those woods, I feel like I'm being watched.
I'm telling you, something weird is going on in this town.
Just today, my mosquito bites spelled out BEWARE.
Ugh, Grunkle Stan.
Nobody ever believes anything I say.
What the?
It's hard to believe it's been six years since I began studying the strange and wondrous secrets of Gravity Falls, Oregon.
What is all this?
Unfortunately, my suspicions have been confirmed.
I'm being watched.
I must hide this book before he finds it.
Remember: in Gravity Falls there is no one you can trust.
No one you can trust...
Uh, uh, it’s nothing!
Uhhh, Let's go somewhere private.
It's amazing!
Grunkle Stan said I was being paranoid, but according to this book, Gravity Falls has this secret dark side.
And get this!
After a certain point, the pages just... stop, like the guy who was writing it, mysteriously disappeared.
Who's that?
Let me get this straight: in the half hour I was gone, you already found a boyfriend?
I was just catching up on, uh, Gold Chains For Old Men Magazine?
So, what's your name?
Are you bleeding, Norman?
There was something about Norman that wasn't right.
I decided to consult the journal.
Known for their pale skin and bad attitudes these creatures are often mistaken for, teenagers?
Beware Gravity Falls's nefarious, ZOMBIE!
Oh, no!
Mabel!
No, no, Mabel, watch out!
AHHHHH!
Is my sister really dating a zombie, or am I just going nuts?
Soos, you've seen Mabel's boyfriend.
He's gotta be a zombie, right?
As always, Soos, you’re right.
My sister could be in trouble.
It was time to get some evidence.
I'd seen enough.
Mabel.
We've gotta talk about Norman.
No, Mabel, listen!
I’m trying to tell you that Norman is not what he seems!
Guess again, sister.
SHA-BAM!
Oh, wait.
I'm-I'm sorry...
Sha-bam!
I’m not joking!
It all adds up: the bleeding, the limp.
He never blinks!
Have you noticed that?
Mabel, remember what the book said about Gravity Falls?
Trust no one!
Mabel, he's gonna eat your brain!
Bu-bu-but What am I gonna do?
Soos was right.
I don’t have any real evidence.
I guess I can be kind of paranoid sometimes and— Wait, WHAT?
I was right!
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!
Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan!
Over here!
Grunkle Stan!
Errrgh!
Stan!
Stan!
Wendy!
Wendy!
Wendy!
I need to borrow the golf cart so I can save my sister from a zombie!
Thanks.
Uh, Thanks?
Don't worry, Mabel!
I'll save you from that zombie!
Hold on!
What the heck is going on here?
Gnomes?
Huh, I was way off.
Gnomes: little men of the Gravity Falls Forest.
Weaknesses: unknown.
Hey, HEY!
Let go of my sister!
Give her back right now, or else!
Seatbelt.
I wouldn't worry about it.
See their little legs?
Those suckers are tiny!
Thanks, Mabel...
Stay back, man!
Uh, where's Grunkle Stan?
There's gotta be a way out of this!
What?
Mabel, don't do this!
Are you crazy?
On three!
Anyone else want some?
Oh, don't be like that.
You saved our butts back there.
Look on the bright side.
Maybe the next one will be a vampire!
Awkward sibling hug?
What's the catch?
Hmm.
That oughta do the trick!
This journal told me there was no one in Gravity Falls I could trust.
But when you battle a hundred gnomes side-by-side with someone, you realize that they've probably always got your back.
Hey, Mabel, could you get the light?
Our uncle told us there was nothing strange about this town.
But who knows what other secrets are waiting to be unlocked.
I'm always ready!
Go, Mountie Man!
Ho ho, no way!
Hey Mabel, check this out.
No, no, Mabel.
This.
We see weirder stuff than that every day!
We didn't get any photos of those gnomes, did we?
Why did you save that?
Um, Happy anniversary?
Grunkle Stan, is this gonna be anything like our last family bonding day?
Wait, what?
Whoa whoa!
Blindfolds never lead to anything good.
Whoa!
Grunkle Stan, are you wearing a blindfold?
What're you playin' at, old man?
Grunkle Stan, why do you wanna bond with us all of a sudden?
Ten hours?
Mabel, did you hear what that old dude said?
The other thing.
About the monster.
If we can snag a photo of it, we can split the prize fifty-fifty.
Imagine what you could do with five. Hundred. Dollars!
Mabel!
Mabel?
Grunkle Stan!
Change of plans: we're taking that boat to Scuttlebutt Island, and we're gonna find that Gobblewonker!
Hoist the anchor!
Raise the flag!
We're gonna win that photo contest!
We're gonna, go get sunscreen!
Alright. If we wanna win this contest, we've gotta do it right!
Think. What's the number one problem with most monster hunts?
No, no, no.
Camera trouble!
Say Bigfoot shows up.
Soos, be Bigfoot?
There he is!
Bigfoot!
Uh-oh, no camera!
Oh, wait, here's one!
Aw, no film!
You see?
You see what I'm, doing here?
That's why I bought seventeen disposable cameras!
Two on my ankle, three in my jacket, four for each of you, three extras in this bag, and one...
under my hat!
There's no way we're gonna miss this.
Okay everybody, let's test our cameras out!
You see?
This is exactly why you need backup cameras.
We still have sixteen!
Fifteen!
Okay, guys, I repeat; don't lose your cameras!
Thirteen!
All right!
We still have thirteen camera, Twelve.
We have twelve cameras.
Okay.
You'll be lookout, Soos can work the steering wheel, and I'll be captain.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
There's no such thing as co-captain.
Okay, fine!
You can be co-captain.
Well, as first co-captain, our number one order of business is to lure the monster out with this.
Granted.
Oh, Soos...
Mabel, leave that thing alone.
Aren't you supposed to be doing lookout?
Pssh!
Yeah, right!
I'm not, Hey!
Quit, Stop!
Mabel!
Our lantern!
Aww!
I can't see anything!
Not worth it?
Guys, imagine what would happen if we got that picture!
Well, I run away from nothing.
Nothing, except for when I ran away from my annoying Grunkle Stan, who I ditched in order to pursue that lake monster.
I'm in!
Guys, guys, guys!
You hear something?
This is it!
This is it!
Everyone: Get your cameras ready!
Ready?
But, but what was that noise, then?
I heard a monster noise!
Maybe that old guy was crazy after all.
What're we gonna say to Grunkle Stan?
We ditched him over nothing.
Hey, guys, do you feel that?
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
This is it!
Come on!
This is our chance!
What's wrong with you guys?
It's not that hard, all right?
All you gotta do is point, and shoot.
Like this!
The picture!
WHY WOULD THAT MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?
All right!
This is it!
Cracked lens?
Soos!
Get a photo!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Go, go, go, go, go!
SOOS!
BEAVERS!
Um, uh, GO INTO THE FALLS!
I think there might be a cave behind there!
Ha ha!
Yeah!
Wait, It's stuck?
THEY'RE ALL GOOD ONES!
What the...
I've got this!
Hold on!
Hey, guys!
Come check this out!
Wha- Yo- You?
You made this?
W-w-why?
I still don't understand.
Well, so much for the photo contest.
Whaddaya wanna do with it?
Hey!
Over here!
Well, we spent all day trying to find a legendary dinosaur.
So, I guess there isn't room in that boat for three more?
Five bucks says you can't do it!
All right, everybody get together.
Say fishing!
What was that?
Not me.
I don't care!
Ugh, boo.
Bad joke.
Bad pelican joke.
Eh, it's easier to find clues when you're that close to the ground.
Mabel, I have very keen powers of observation.
For example, just by smelling your breath, I can tell that you have been eating ...
an entire tube of toothpaste?
Buried treasure!
Whoa!
It's a secret wax museum!
Except for that one.
Is anyone else getting the creeps here?
maybe you should carve something from real life.
Y-okay, Or, you know, something else.
Like, like someone in your family.
I can't believe this many people showed up.
He bribed me.
Who would do something like this?
You're kidding, right?
There must be evidence, motives.
You know, I could help if you want.
All signs pointed to the goat.
Adorable?
That's it!
Mabel, you and me are going to find the jerk who did this, and get back that head.
Then we'll see who's adorable.
Wax Stan has lost his head and its up to us to find it.
There were a lot of unhappy customers at the unveiling.
The murderer could have been anyone.
In this town, anything is possible.
Ghosts, zombies, it could be months before we find our first clue.
Footprints in the shag carpet!
And they're leading to...
So, what do you think?
He was furious when he didn't get that free pizza.
Don't call us that.
Sorry, Grunkle Stan, but we have got a big break in the case!
We're heading to the town right now to interrogate the murderer.
This is the place.
Got the fake IDs?
Here goes nothing.
Alright, let's just try to blend in, ok?
Manly Dan, just the guy I wanted to see.
Where were you last night?
You were at work.
10 o'clock, the time of the murder.
So, I guess you've never seen this before?
Hey, actually I'm a...
Left handed...
Mabel, big break in the case!
It's a left handed ax.
These are all our suspects.
Manly Dan is right handed, that means all we have to do is find our left handed suspect and we've got our killer.
Let's find that murderer.
Mabel, there's only one person left on this list.
The evidence is irrefutable.
On 3! 1, 2, ...
Toby Determined, you're under arrest for murder of the wax body of Grunkle Stan.
Then allow me to explain.
You were hoping that Grunkle Stan's new attraction would be the story that saved your failing newspaper.
But when the show was a flop, you decided to go out and make your own headline.
But you were sloppy, and all the clues pointed to a shabby shoed reporter who was caught left handed.
I knew it!
Wait, what did you say?
Nothing?
You say nothing?
But, but it has to be him!
Check the ax for fingerprints!
No prints?
Those cops are right about me.
But I considered everything: the weapon, the motive, the clues Wax Stan's shoe has a hole in it...
Wait a minute, what has a hole on its shoe and no fingerprints?
Mabel!
The murderers are, Wax Sherlock Holmes! Wax Shakespeare! Wax Coolio?
But, how is this possible?
You're made of wax!
So, you're trying to murder Grunkle Stan for real?
I don't know!
I-I don't really know.
I'm not-I'm not really sure.
Interview this, Larry King!
Jokes on you, Groucho!
Ha, Genghis Khan!
You fell harder than the, uh, I don't know, uh, Jin Dynasty?
Heh. Yeah. Alright.
Don't count on it!
Um, you got any sunscreen?
You know, letting me lead you outside?
Probably not you sharpest decision.
Case closed!
I couldn't have done it without my sidekick.
What?
Says who?
Have people been saying that?
Have you heard that?
I decapitated Larry King.
On the bright side, though, look what we found.
Oh I'm not so sure about that.
Is there any other alternative...
Actually, the answer is yes.
So, did you get rid of all the wax figures?
Good enough for me!
Gideon?
I think we should go and find out.
Do tents have roofs?
Whoa, this is like a bizarro version of the Mystery Shack.
They even have their own Soos.
Let's see what this monster looks like.
That's Stan's mortal enemy?
What?
I'm not impressed.
Wha—?
How did he—?
Come on.
Man, that kid's an even bigger fraud than Stan!
No wonder our uncle's jealous.
You're too easily impressed.
Is that permanent?
Whoa, where have you been?
And what's going on with those fingernails, you look like a wolverine.
Mabel, I don't trust anyone whose hair is bigger than their head.
What do you mean?
Mabel, guys don't work that way.
He's gonna fall in love with you.
Okay, we agree on something here.
I didn't know!
I didn't hear about it and plus, I told her not to.
Hey.
How'd it go?
Well, at least it's over and you'll never have to go out with him again.
Mabel?
It's over, right?
Mabel?
Like this: no.
What in the heck happened on that date?
Mabel, come on.
It's not like you're gonna have to marry Gideon.
Oh no.
Mabel, Are you gonna come out of sweater town?
Alright, enough is enough.
If you can't break up with Gideon, I'll do it for you.
Alright.
Thanks, you uh...
Look, Gideon.
We've got to talk.
Mabel isn't joining you tonight, she uh, she doesn't want to see you anymore.
She's uh. She's kinda weirded out by you, no offense.
You're not gonna like, freak out or anything, are ya?
Okay.
Cool.
Then again, sorry man, but uh, hey, thumbs up.
Huh?
Don't worry, Mabel, he's just a kid.
He doesn't have any powers.
Your turn.
Aw, man...
Hello?
Oh hey man.
Sorry for accusing you of murder last week.
Oh, finally!
I thought nobody would ever ask!
I have notes and theories!
Uh huh, uh huh.
412 Gopher Road.
Tonight?
Got it.
Ughh, Gideon.
What do you want from me, man?
Is this about Mabel?
I told you, she's not into you!
Uh, you okay, man?
But-but you're a fake.
Grunkle Stan was right about you, you ARE a monster!
She's never gonna date you, man!
Uh, Mabel!
This probably isn't the best time to be brutally honest with him!
Not so powerful without this, are you?
Gideon.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, how's he gonna destroy us now, huh?
Try to guess what number we're thinking of?
Mabel, do you believe in ghosts?
Can we actually go up there?
Cool!
Did you put all this stuff up here?
Later Wendy!
Heh heh heh!
Good times!
Yeah, right!
I just think Wendy's cool, okay?
It's not like I lie awake at night thinking about her!
I am pretending to write something down.
Uh what, yes?
I don't really dance.
Now is not the time to talk about the Lamby Dance.
Well uh, uh, Wait!
Why don't I-or we come with you?
We're thirteen!
So, technically a teen.
Come on, Mabel.
This is our chance to hang out with, you know, the cool kids.
And Wendy and whatever.
Oh hey, what's that?
She's not much for first impressions.
Unlike this guy!
...this guy...
Oh, you mean the big muffin!
Mabel, please!
Did you just lick my hand?
Why'd they shut it down, was it like a health code violation, or-
Wha, Are you guys serious?
Okay Okay!
Just gotta get a foothold...
Let me take a crack at it!
So, what are we going to do now?
Maybe they had a good reason.
Really?
Yes, yes I am.
I'm on it!
Uh, no.
I'm cool.
Everything's cool.
That's uh, um uh, hey look!
Dancy Pants Revolution!
The game that tricks people into exercising!
Heh heh, yeah lets all- let's go play that.
Heh heh, yeah.
That's, that's great.
I'll be right back.
Come on, Grunkle Stan, pick up!
Ugh, what is he doing!
Mabel, I need your advice.
We're hanging out in a haunted convenience store, I can't get a hold of Grunkle Stan, and if I try to say anything about it to any of these guys they'll just think I'm a scared little kid or something!
Mabel!
How many of these did you eat!
Oh man.
Oh man, oh man, oh man.
Wait!
Maybe let's not do that.
All I'm saying is, why tempt the fates?
I mean... What if this place really is, haunted?
I thought I was Dr. Funtimes.
I'm not a 9-year-old!
I'm 13! Technically a teen!
Status update: AAAAUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHH!
Can you hear us!
Everybody, wait!
Whatever's doing this has to have some kind of reason!
Maybe if we can figure out what it is, they'll let us out of here!
They got Mabel!
Yeah!
Can we just go now and leave forever?
Revenge, I guess?
Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here.
Why was each person taken?
Tambry was texting, Thompson was playing a video game, Lee was being sarcastic; it doesn't make any sense!
Wendy, say that last part again.
Of course!
Stay here until I get back!
Hey ghost!
I've got something to tell you!
I'm not a teenager!
I'm, I'm twelve, technically not a teen.
But they're my friends, isn't there anything I can do to, help them?
Uh, is there anything else I can do?
OKAY OKAY OKAY!
Um, Well, I do know, the Lamby Lamby Dance.
Bu-but I can't really do it, without a lamb costume!
Oh, well, there it is.
Don't don't don't you forget about the babies!
Well I don't think you have to worry about us coming back, so, Hey!
There's still some left!
Yeah, that was pretty crazy.
Next time?
Yah!
Let's, let's hang out at the Shack!
Yeah, Next time...
Grunkle Stan?
Huuuuungry.
Don't worry guys, pancakes are on me.
I'm gonna win some by beating that manliness tester.
What?
What's so funny?
Hey, I am too Manly...
Manny or whatever it is you said. 
Disco girl, coming through, that girl is you...
DON'T COME IN!
DON'T COME IN!
Heh heh, I wasn't.
It's not important.
Look, come on guys, I'm plenty masculine.
You see this chest hair?
Aw man...
Fine, family of little faith.
Get ready to eat your words.
And a plate a delicious pancakes.
Alright, Dipper.
Time to manhandle this, man handle...
And a one and a two...
Oh, what?
This thing must be broken.
It's totally broken, guys.
It's like a million years old, probably ran out of steam power or-
It's rickety man, you shouldn't even-
I need to get some chest hair and fast.
I'm fine!
Heh heh!
Everything's fine!
Not manly enough, stupid diner, stupid lumberjack...
Oh what?
Are you saying I'm not a male man?
Is that what you're trying to say?
I'm not male?
I'm not a man?
Is that-is that what you're getting at?
No chest hair yet.
Is it physical, is it mental, what's the secret?
You said it brother.
I need help.
Wait, sorry.
Please don't eat me!
I haven't showered!
In like a week!
And, I'm all elbows!
Elbows, and gristle!
No.
I can't believe it, part animal, part human.
Are you some kind of Minotaur?
So did I, like, summon you or-?
I have problems, Manotaur.
Man-related problems.
Well, my own uncle called me a wimp, And I kind of flunked this manliness video game thing...
Hey, you know, you seem pretty manly.
Maybe you could give me some pointers?
Uh, okay.
Dude, watch out!
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!
Whoa, This place is amazing!
S'up.
My name's Dipper, The, uh, Destructor?
I need your help!
Look at this guys!
Look at this!
I like these guys.
Denied?
Ok, fine.
That's ok with me.
Obviously you guys think it would be too hard to train me.
Maybe, you're not man enough to try.
Seems to me you're too scared to teach me how to be a man.
Hey, do you guys hear that?
It sounds like... Bock-bock. Bock.
Oh, that's weird-Bocock, bocAW!
Is that? BACAWK!
That sounds like-BACAW!
Yeah, a bunch of chickens!
Great!
Thanks guys, whatever it is, I will not let you down.
The what..
Are you sure this is really necessary?
AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
Guys, I just wanna say that these last few hours have been, I-I feel like there's really been some growth.
Glurk, you are hilarious today!
It's just you guys took me under your wing, and have just been so supportive.
No, you know what?
You really have been.
I think I feel like I'm finally becoming a man here.
I've survived forty-nine other trials.
Whatever it is, bring it on!
Is he like the oldest, or wisest, or...
HUUUAAARRRRGGHHH!
The Multi-Bear?
Is that some sort of bear..
Conquer?
I don't know, man.
Oh no!
Ha ha, I don't know whose that is, just borrowing it, friend's, not mine.
Uh...
Hmph.
I SHALL CONQUER THE MULTI-BEAR!
I'm okay!
I'm comin' for you, multi-bear.
What is a Multi-bear?
Oh, that's a multi-bear.
Multi-bear!
I seek your head!
Or, one of them, anyway?
There's like-what?
Six heads?
A real man shows no mercy!
Uh... Okay.
You listen to Icelandic pop group BABBA?
I-I love BABBA.
Oh, you mean Disco girl...
This is crazy!
Finally someone who-who understands... uh... oh yeah.
I guess I'm suppose to kill you?
Or I'll never be a man?
Really?
I'm not gonna do it.
Listen, Leaderaur, alright?
You too, Tesosteraur, Pubertaur, and... I don't know, whatever you're name is. B-Beardy.
You keep telling me that being a man means doing all these tasks, and being aggro all the time, but I'm starting to think that stuff's malarkey.
You heard me, malarkey.
So maybe I don't have muscles, or hair in certain places, and... sure, when a girly pop song comes on the radio, sometimes, I leave it on!
'Cause dang it, top 40 hits are in the top 40 for a reason!
They're catchy!
I'm saying the Multi-bear is a really nice guy.
And you're bunch of jerks if you want me to cut off his head!
Then I guess I'll never be a man.
I don't want to talk about it.
It's just these half man half bull humanoids were hanging out with me, But then they wanted me to do this really tough, horrible thing but it just wasn't right.
So I said no.
You're right!
I do!
Ha ha, this is amazing!
I really do!
Take that, man tester!
Take that, Pituitor!
This guy has chest hair!
OH, GROSS!
Seriously, that's disgusting.
Oh no, Mabel.
I-I don't feel so good.
I-BBBBLLLAAAA!
BBBBLLLAAAA!
BBBBLLLAAA!
Maybe comments like that are why kids don't go to the Mystery Shack.
Does it even work?
Stay back!
Oh my gosh!
Mabel, I think this copier can copy human beings!
I, I could work with Wendy.
I promise.
What?
Yeah, yeah.
Laugh all you want, but I devised a plan to make sure my night with Wendy goes perfect.
Psh.
Over complicated?
Let me just, alright, fold that there, kay.
Step 1: Getting to know each with playful banter.
Banter is like talking but smarter.
Yeah, see?
This isn't banter.
This is what I want to avoid with Wendy.
The final step is to ask her to dance.
If I follow steps 1 through 11, nothing can get in my way!
Step 9, sister!
Step 1: Casual banter.
SO HERE'S A CASUAL QUESTION!
What's your favorite type of snack food?
NO way!
Mine too!
Uhh, I mean, I mean, New topic!
New topic!
Umm, well I, um I'll be back shortly!
Sure Stan won't mind if I'm gone for a few minutes.
I promise.
If only I could be two places at once.
I wonder if this is a good idea.
Whoa! ...I have a really big head.
I will call you: Number 2.
Definitely not.
You know a name I've always wanted?
Okay, Tyrone.
Let's get down to business.
I'm thinking you cover me at the ticket stand, while I ask Wendy to dance.
Hey, we're not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we?
Great news, Wendy!
I got someone to cover the concessions for me!
We got to get rid of Robbie if I ever want to dance with Wendy!
Oh no!
They're sitting on the couch!
We gotta think of something quick!
I got an idea!
And that's where you come in number three!
But what if Robbie catches me?
I'll be all alone!
Okay, one more.
Good point.
Four Dippers.
This is a four Dipper plan.
C'mon, you're not gonna make me partner up with him, are you?
Okay.
Just one more clone.
Oh, tough break.
I wonder who those guys are who aren't me because I'm right here.
Ok, ok.
I-uh, Uh, I'll be right back!
The dance floor is a minefield, a MINEFIELD, Tyrone!
Stan might get in the way.
There's too many variables.
We need help.
Alright, Dippers!
Gather round!
Now's the time!
You all clear on want to do?
Hey, Soos, look!
A glowing dot!
I don't need luck.
I have a plan.
W-What are you doing here?
I mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor, uh, in like exactly 42 seconds?
Um, uh, okay.
Small talk, small talk, small talk!
I, uh, Ha, ha, ha.
I'd probably go for Stretch over there, uh, because tall people can reach coconuts?
Ha, you were a freak!
You know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before I started hiding it all the time.
Uh, no!
It's nothing!
I-I was-I wa–why did I say that?
Of course.
You won't believe it guys!
I bumped into Wendy accidentally and things are actually going great!
Oh man, you guys sound crazy.
Look, maybe we don't need the plan anymore, you know?
Maybe I could just go talk to her like a normal person.
You bite your tongue!
If you're not gonna stick to the plan, maybe you shouldn't be the Dipper to dance with Wendy.
Guys, c'mon.
We said we weren't gonna turn on each other.
No, no, hey, hey!
AAAAAH!
No, wait!
Ahh, I can't breath in here!
Omnomnom...
Fair point, fair point.
Counterpoint, maybe I should get to dance with Wendy because I've been around her the least.
That makes, like, zero sense.
YOU MAKE ZERO SENSE!
Watch it!
Don't shove people!
Break out.
Hold on guys, think about it.
We're exact equals mentally and physically.
If we start fighting, it'll just go on for infinity.
CLONE FIGHT!
Quit hitting myself, quit hitting myself!
Hey!
Classic Dipper's getting away!
No friends, it's me, Number 7.
That's not me guys, that's not me!
Get him!
Stay back, stay back!
Huh, how 'bout that.
You think we even have a chance with Wendy?
I mean she's 15, we're 12.
I know.
Mabel was right, I do get in my own way.
Tyrone!
Uh-uh, of course.
Tyrone!
You were the only one who understood.
Grunkle Stan, what's going on?
Man.
Look at the town.
Whoa, gold panning!
Oh yeah.
I remember this.
In Gravity Falls it used to be legal to marry woodpeckers.
There's a carpetbagger in the turnip cellar!
I don't know, Mabel.
Isn't that girl kinda like your arch-enemy?
Excuse me.
Hey, you okay?
Uh, nnnoooo?
C'mon, Mabel, you love that sweater!
Pacifica!
Why does she think that being related to the town founder means she can treat everyone like garbage.
Someone needs to take her down a peg.
Wait a minute!
I feel like I read something about Pacifica's great-great grandfather before.
Journal 3 Of course!
Oh, this is perfect.
In my investigations, Should- should I do the voice?
I'll just read, normal.
In my investigations I recently made a discovery.
Nathaniel Northwest may not be the true founder of Gravity Falls!
I believe this secret is emburied somewhere on the enclosed document.
If only I could crack the code.
Oh, man!
If this cover-up is true, it means Pacifica's whole family is a fraud.
This could be a major conspiracy!
I got to investigate this!
Oh yeah, definitely.
Yeah!
Mystery twins?
I'm starting to accept it.
Alright, Mabel, if we can prove Nathaniel Northwest wasn't the real founder of Gravity Falls, it will finally put Pacifica in her place.
We just need to crack this code.
Let me see, it's not Egyptian, it's not numerology, it's not, wait-of course!
The triangle is the alchemist symbol for flame.
Lighting the parchment on fire will reveal the secret message!
Alright, let's just light this sucker up and, Mabel!
Wait, Mabel.
You folded it into a map!
And I was gonna burn it, 
Maybe we should take this elsewhere...
You realize what this means, Mabel.
We're gonna have to break in.
We're in.
Ewww, no.
According to the map, the next clue about the real town founder should be right, here!
We've gotta figure this one out quick, I have a feeling those cops weren't at the library to check out books...
So what is it anyway?
Huh?
Wait!
It's not abstract, it's upside-down!
Let's go!
Quick!
Head rush.
Ah, The statue must be pointing to the next clue.
Mabel, look!
Okay, look out for booby traps.
Tranquilizer darts!
Hey, jackpot!
Now we'll find out who the real town founder was.
Let it be here recorded that Nathaniel Northwest, fabled founder of Gravity Falls, was, in fact, a fraud...
as well as a waste-shoveling village idiot?
Oh, bad news for Pacifica.
Wait'll the papers hear about this!
The true founder of Gravity Falls was sir lord, Quentin Trembley, III, Esquire.
What do you mean, national security?
Shh!
Mabel.
Whoa!
Is that, like, amber or something?
Does that mean...?
Hey!
Let us out!
You're alive!
But how?
He's right!
Making maps into hats, hanging upside-down; Your silliness solved the code that serious cops couldn't crack in a hundred years!
I, don't think that's gonna work.
I think I know who can help you.
I'm not sure this is working.
We gotta get out of here!
Give me that!
Sheriff Blubs, do you really want to lock us all up in a government facility somewhere?
Wait!
Quentin, did you ever sign an official resignation?
Then, technically you're still legally the President of the United States, right?
You've gotta answer to this guy now!
Uh- actually- uh-
Aren't you gonna tell her about her ate-gray ampa-gray?
Well, I haven't learned anything!
Hey, Pacifica!
Nathaniel Northwest didn't found Gravity Falls, and your whole family is a sham.
Deal with it!
Man, revenge is underrated.
That felt awesome!
Whoa.
This is worthless.
I'm gonna say, off a cliff.
It works!
I think the sky tram is broken.
Also, most of my bones.
How do they get them into this shape?
It's unnatural.
I'll be right here!
Haha!
I love you!
Eh, it's no big deal.
Okay, you're right, it is!
Isn't this amazing?
I just dove in!
I said, Hey!
You wanna hang out at the fair?
And you know what she said?
Yeah, I guess so!
It totally worked!
All your advice about just going for it, it's finally paying off!
Who wants to know?
Yeah!
You know, I think I saw her in the Bottomless Pit.
You should really go jump in there.
Yeah, but he's a jerk with tight pants and a guitar.
I need to keep him away from Wendy at all costs.
My uncle taught me the secret to these games.
You aim for the carnie's head, and take the prize when he's unconscious.
One ball, please.
And a-one and a-two and a-three!
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!
Wendy!
Are you okay?
Everything's gonna be fine!
Don't worry!
I'll-I'll go get some ice!
Where is she, where is she?
Hey, watch where you're going, man!
Everything is different now.
Uhhhhhhhh... Mabel, do you ever wish you could go back and undo just one mistake?
I mean Wendy only went out with Robbie because he was there with the ice, and she needed the ice because of the baseball, and I would've had the ice if it wasn't for, that guy!
Hey, you!
Toolbelt!
You ruined my life!
So wait a minute, if you're from the future, do you have like a time machine, or something?
Can I borrow it?
Come on, can I use your time machine just once?
It looks like a tape measure.
This making any sense to you?
You know, you sound like you could use a break.
Here it is, Mabel.
Our ticket to any moment in history.
We gotta be smart about this.
All that paradox talk kinda freaked me out.
All I'm gonna do is go back and fix my one mistake.
If I don't miss that base ball throw, I won't hit Wendy in the eye, and Robbie won't comfort her, and they won't start going out.
See you later.
Do-over?
Hey, Wendy!
Uh, nothing.
Hey, look!
What's that?
One ball, please.
That's what you think...
One panda-duck, comin' right up!
Okay, Dipper, second chance, don't mess this up.
Yes!
That's so weird...
The exact same thing happened twice; it was spooky.
It is possible that the forces of time naturally conspire to undo any new outcomes?
No, I just need to try again.
Third time's the charm!
Wendy, how badly do you want that stuffed animal thing?
Ahkay, I just thought the wind speed... factoring cotton candy, Like there's one variable missing, That's it!
I've figured out to win the toss, not hit Wendy, and stop Wendy and Robbie from going out!
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't leave, I need you for my plan!
It'll just take a few minutes, let's go!
And a-one and a-two and a-uh!
Mabel, what's
I'll just wait until you're done.
Okay, what is wrong?
Oh, Mabel, I'm sorry.
Mabel!
Wait.
Look.
I did the math.
In any other timeline, Wendy ends up going out with Robbie.
I can't mess up this day again!
When are we?
Yeah, I already
It's the same thing.
Do you hear that?
You sent us back 150 years, genius, it's pioneer times!
Mabel, we can't start messing with the past!
Give me that!
I'm gonna set the timeline right!
WHAT DID YOU DO?
There's nothing but inky blackness for miles!
Mabel, don't you see?
We've transported to the end of time!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
But which present?
Look, Mabel, it's over!
Okay?
Give it up!
I've worked too hard to lose this!
You said that about a ball of yarn once!
Do you really want Wendy to date Robbie?
You're not guilt-tripping me, Mabel.
Not this time.
Come on, Mabel, I know you.
You're gonna forget about this in a day!
Here!
Hey!
I'll prove it!
See?
Okay, maybe you'll forget in a week...
A month!
She'll better in a month!
Uh, grrrr!
Wendy, I just wanted to say that, well I just wanted say that people makes mistakes, and when they do, you should forgive them.
And also that tight pants are overrated.
I know, One ball, please.
And a-one and a-two and a-huh!
It is done.
I couldn't break your heart, Mabel.
Besides, there's no way Wendy can date Robbie all summer, right?
Well, we're still here.
Wait, Mabel; I think it was us.
Oh, geez, I gotta deal with this all summer?
That'll do pig, That'll do.
Watch out!
Wow!
Ooh, cutscene!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
YOU TAKE THAT BAAACK!
Let's gang up on him.
Are you wearing mascara?
But we just started this round.
Ugh, sounds like Robbie.
I'll handle it.
You realize she's not here, right?
She's out camping with her family today.
And if you listened to her for once you'd know that.
I- just said she's not here.
What?
C'mon, man!
Hey!
Look-!
Don't!
You don't have to-!
I-I'll buy you a new one!
What was I thinking?
I can't fight!
I've never been in a fight before!
Look at these noodle arms!
Maybe he'll just forget about it.
Maybe it'll all blow over.
R-Really?
I can't stay here!
What if Robbie comes back!
I gotta hide!
C'mon Soos, Robbie's twice my size.
I mean, what will getting myself killed accomplish?
I just need to hide here until 3 o'clock passes.
Uggggh, this day will never end!
Stupid Robbie.
Such a jerk!
That's easy for you to say, you have more than one life.
Ugh, I wish one of these guys would fight Robbie for me.
To unleash ultimate power?
 I do like things that are ultimate.
Back, back, hold, forward, back, forward, down, hold, quarter circle, forward, triple punch!
I guess it didn't work.
Uhhh Soos?
Uhhh, Rumble McSkirmish?
Whoa!
You're real?
Your pixels are really sharp!
Ugh!
Cooool!
With Rumble around, Robbie will be so scared, I won't even need to fight him.
I've got the world's greatest fighter to be my bodyguard!
This is so amazing!
I gotta show Soos!
Soos?
Well, we don't have any traditional power ups: turkey legs, pizza boxes, or gold rings.
How about, half a taco?
I wish I could do that!
That's gonna be tough, for a number of reasons.
But I do know a fighter here in Gravity Falls.
His name is Robbie and he's kinda like my arch enemy.
Well he's dating the girl I like and he posts a really annoying amount of status updates.
Uh, sure.
Anyway, I was hoping you could, y'know, scare him off for me so I don't have to fight the guy.
So you'll protect me from Robbie?
Uh oh, I think I hear my uncle.
Stay perfectly still!
I said stay still.
Hey Mabel.
Have you met Rumble yet?
He's my new bodyguard.
Mabel, he's not a toy, he's a fighting machine.
I'm gonna get him to defend me from Robbie.
I guess so.
Well, I'll see you after the fight.
Don't worry.
As soon as he sees you, he's gonna wet his pants.
Whoa!
Where'd that came from?
Trust me, you won't need that.
Just give him a good scare.
This street has really dangerous litter.
Look dude, I don't think you want to fight me.
Let's just call this thing off before someone gets hurt.
Okay, dude!
You asked for it!
This happens to be the greatest warrior that ever lived!
I'm giving you one last chance, back down, or this guy's gonna go nuts.
You asked for it.
Rumble?
I didn't wanna have to do this, man, but you gave me no choice.
Maybe now, if you, Whoa!
Rumble!
You can stop!
I think Robbie's had enough, STOP!
I SAID STOP!
What the heck was that?
You were only supposed to scare him, you almost killed him!
This isn't good.
Something told me this would be his first stop.
Please, Rumble!
You gotta stop!
Rumble, wait!
You don't have to do this!
At least pace yourself...
You might get a cramp, Ah!
Soos!
Where you been?
Yeah, I kinda sorta brought him to life to be my bodyguard.
But now I have to stop him before he kills Robbie!
You know I do.
Rumble!
This has to stop!
Please!
Listen to me!
RUMBLE!
Rumble!
I have something to tell you!
Robbie, Robbie didn't kill my father.
What?
No one.
I-I lied to you.
I guess I kinda am...
I have to.
I started all this and I've got to at least try to stop it.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Urr!
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Yes!
Oh no.
So, what should I do, roll him up and put him on my wall?
You, sir, truly are the champion of champions.
I wouldn't be too sure about that, man.
Game over, old friend.
I don't know, man.
So I guess you and I have to fight now, huh?
Go ahead, man.
Do your worse.
I just want to get this over with.
You're back!
Fighting?
Yeah, we actually fell over trying to stop two other guys from fighting each other.
Did you hear that?
She called me one of her two boys!
Look, Robbie, if we're stay at each other's throats, we're both gonna lose Wendy.
We need to make a cold war pact.
We need to learn to hate each other, in silence.
Yeah, exactly!
What girls do.
I'm Dipper.
I have shorts and determination!
We're rich!
I'm gonna get a butler!
Yeah, OK.
It's a pawn, that's not your color, and stop stealing the tiny horses!
And, checkmate!
O-oh! Dipper wins again!
I got it.
What?
No she's not.
We're the same height.
We've always been.
C'mon, guys, nobody even uses millimeters.
It only makes you taller than me in Canada.
By ONE millimeter.
Ugh!
Stupid Mabel!
I'm not short!
Oh, come on.
There's gotta be some way to get taller.
Let's see...
Legends of miniature buffalo and giant squirrels have led me to believe there are height altering properties hidden deep within the forest.
Hmm, Ooh!
Agh!
Aagh.
Whoa.
Huh?
Is that mountain lion tiny or just far away in perspective?
PERSPECTIVE!
PERSPECTIVE!
AAAAAAH!
It still hurts, but less!
Whoa.
What the heck?
Smaller.
Bigger.
TOO BIG!
Hey guys, notice anything different about me?
What can I say, sis?
Growth spurt.
What?
But we're the same height now.
Oh yeah?
Something tells me I've got another growth spurt comin' on right now.
Y'know, puberty and stuff.
What?
Fine!
Open it!
It's not a wizard!
I grew myself using this magic flashlight!
It's okay it can shrink things too.
Oh Ah ah!
Hey, give it back!
Really?
Lean closer and I'll tell you!
We've gotta get out of here and save Stan!
Okay, how are we going to do this.
Gideon's got magic and, like, a zillion inches on us.
On the bright side, at least we're finally the same height again.
You're still taller?
Arrgh!
How did this happen?
Just another reason we've gotta get that flashlight back.
I have a plan.
Come on!
We need to get higher.
Mabel!
up there.
He's heading to shrink Stan!
Maybe it can.
Down there!
We're just in time, but how are we going to stop him?
Ah shoo ah ha ah!
It's for the greater good.
Okay.
Wait, you're gonna grow us back to equal height right?
Well if it doesn't matter, why don't you just do it?
Oh, I'm acting weird?
You're the one who keeps calling me names and stuff.
Don't say it!
It's not your fault, Soos, I'm the guy who put together that shrinking device.
I guess it's just you kept teasing me Mabel, like all day.
What was that all about?
Oh man, now I feel like a big jerk.
Alright I walked into that one.
Are we cool?
Let's get back that flashlight before Gideon gets Stan.
There it is!
Don't look directly at it!
Not completely doomed!
To his armpit!
Just! Come on!
After you.
You earned it.
Stop it.
Seems like the smart thing to do.
Lots of glue.
Wait, Summer-what?
Do you always carry that calendar in your pocket?
We're gonna have the best costumes, get the most candy...
Well, you don't have to worry about us.
We've got spirit to go around.
Ugh!
What is this stuff?
I've never even heard of these brands.
Sand Pop?
Gummy chairs?
Adequate-Bar?
Your cape is caught in your fly, Soos.
Goodbye loser candy!
Happy Summerw-AHH!
Wendy!
Ha ha!
Ow, Wha-what's up, guys?
Well actually I, uh
Uh, yeah.
Trick-or-treating is for babies.
I guess.
Hey guys, wait!
Maybe I'll see you at the party.
How am I gonna tell Mabel?
Look, I can't go trick-or-treating.
I'm, uh, really sick.
Must have been that bad candy.
Go on without me.
Dude, really?
You're a little old for this, man.
Sorry.
I told you, Mabel, I'm just not feeling it tonight.
I'm not trick-or-treating!
Look man, just go to another house!
I'm not getting that.
Five hundred treats in one night?
That's impossible!
Oh my gosh Mabel, do you realize what this means?
Soos, a monster is making us trick-or-treat or else he's gonna eat us!
How are we gonna get that much candy in one night?
There's no way!
All night?
But-but I'm sick, remember?
I don't understand why we can't just buy our candy and be done with it.
I'm trying to take the DIE out of trick-or-treat-or-die.
Uh, actually, I'm not dressed up as anything.
We're, we're kinda in a hurry, here.
Four pieces of candy?
This is gonna take forever!
I told you, I'm not up to it, Mabel!
Hey!
Erase that!
Let's just get this over with, okay?
Do you really think this will make a difference?
Let's get that candy, guys!
C'mon, c'mon!
And it's only 8:30.
Perfect timing!
The perfect time to go to Wendy's party, and no one needs to know I was trick-or-treating.
Oh hey, Wendy.
What's up?
Oh, um.
Haha, I'm on my way.
I like watching the trick-or-treaters.
Reminds me of when I was a kid.
Definitely, definitely.
Later, guys.
Well, hey, I
Relax, relax.
I left it right here.
Behind this bush.
Oh no.
Well, I-pch I-!
Just don't blow out that candle!
Don't blow out that candle!
Phew, that was close.
I swear, we had all 500 pieces.
Look, it's down there somewhere.
We can still get it.
Go, go, go, go!
Thanks, Soos.
Phew.
I'm just glad it's over, right?
Hey, are you okay?
There's probably some bandages back at the Shack.
Breaks!
Breaks!
Breaks!
We have to hide!
It's blocking the only exit.
Everyone, stay quiet!
Mabel, you know that's not true.
I just felt like I was getting a little to old to go trick-or-treating.
This way!
Almost there!
Soos!
Hey monster!
What are you—?
Wait, it is.
Hey, Stan!
Uh... I-uh... I was trick-o-treating.
With my sister.
Eesh, Grunkle Stan.
It's like when you see tourists, all you see are wallets with legs.
Grunkle Stan, this is demeaning.
Grunkle Stan, why do I have to wear this wolf costume?
I think I'm getting hookworm.
You've got all these dumb, fake exhibits in the Shack.
Meanwhile, I've seen actual, amazing things in the forest every day!
What if you hunted down a real attraction instead of lying to people for a living?
Okay, is it just me, or is having Grunkle Stan as a boss seriously the worst?
Yeah, totally!
Did you just make a bet with a professional con man?
You broke the jar.
I guess I shouldn't be too worried.
I mean, how much money could Stan even make on vacation?
Are those, shoulder pads?
Why does your mug say #2?
Finally!
It's time to show Stan how a REAL mystery hunter does it!
Dipper out!
Mabel!
I captured something!
This is gonna blow those tourists away!
Ha ha!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
My name's Honest Dipper, and unlike my cheating uncle, I have something to show you that isn't a hoax!
It nearly killed me getting him into that cage, behold, part gremlin, part goblin, the Gremloblin!
What!
Those aren't strings, that's body hair!
No, everything else here is fake.
This is a real paranormal beast.
Hey, fun fact about this little guy, if you look into his eyes, you can see your worst nightmare.
Amazing, right?
I work for tips.
Thanks again for visiting!
Well, I just made two people go insane.
How about you?
Well, maybe you need to start being a little bit tougher around here.
What?
How did he get out of his locked cage!
YOU GAVE HIM A BREAK?
We've got to round him up.
Where's Soos?
Uh, got it!
When fighting a gremloblin, use water, only as a last resort as water will make him much much scarier!
Who writes sentences like that!
Don't worry, he's gotta leave eventually!
Mabel, wait!
Don't look into his evil eye; you'll see your worst nightmare!
Wait.
Hey, monster!
Take a look at this!
Well at least he didn't do that much damage.
Oh boy.
What you had to, Mabel.
What you had to.
But what do I show them?
Real magic just freaks people out.
Ladies and gentle-tourists!
This shack is filled with wonders, NEVER before seen by human eyes!
Behold, the horrible giant question baby!
Have your picture taken with it for a buck.
Uh, ten bucks.
A hundred bucks!
We put the fun in no refunds!
How'd we do?
Minus the money to replace all the furniture.
And supplies to fix the shack, that leaves us...
So, wait.
If you lost everything, then that means...
Mabel!
You won!
Mabel, didn't your agreement say something about Stan having to do some kind of apology dance if he lost?
Grunkle Stan, why are we here again?
What are you doing?
Grunkle Stan, do I really have to be the one to point out that a bottomless pit is, by definition, impossible?
Quick!
Everyone back to the shack!
Where are we?
We're gonna land on something eventually.
It could be any second now.
I've got a story.
It's called the time Grunkle Stan got us all thrown into a bottomless pit where we spent the rest of our NATURAL LIVES!
Fine.
I'll tell you a story.
A story I'd like to call Voice Over.
Guys!
I think I just got bit by a snake!
I need you to get me to a hospital quick!
What?
What's so funny?
My what?
Are you saying my voice cracks?
My voice doesn't crack!
Do I really sound like that?
Give me that!
Even my sigh sounds weird.
Why do you spit on your hand?
Hey, I remember you!
Your robot almost killed me!
This will really fix my voice?
Thanks!
Good morning Dipper.
I did it!
I diiid it!
Now I have a neeew voice!
Ha ha ha!
Morning Mabel.
Who's my favorite Mabel?
Mabel, it's me.
This is my voice now.
I sound awesome.
Soouund aaawesome.
But Mabel, this is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
And just think of the prank calls.
Hello, this is the President of the United States of America.
I am calling to tell you...
Magnificent!
How are you diddly-doing, Soos?
What gives, man?
You guys all made fun of my old voice.
I thought you'd like the new one.
I'll find Stan.
He'll like my new voice.
You'll see.
I'll be right back after these messages!
I mean, goodbye.
Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan!
Where are you, Grunkle Stan?
No I'm not.
I'm a 12 year old boy.
Wait!
Escaaape!
McGucket!
Your invention was a catastrophe!
My own sister didn't recognize me.
I scared away crowds.
I even sound ridiculous when I cry.
Good!
Hurry up!
It was ridiculous, wasn't it?
Hey guys.
I guess I realized that even though my voice may not be perfect, it's still mine, and I wouldn't change it for anything, not even for whatever was in this new vial.
I dumped it in Stan's coffee.
Woooaah!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Have you ever tried maybe tilting the machine?
Uh, guys, there's an awful lot of green lightning coming out of that game.
Soos!
We're inside the game!
Crazy!
Awesome!
Multi-Ball!
Over there!
How are we gonna get out of here?
Think, guys.
Alright, let's go, Soos.
Soos?
Soos, pssssst.
What's going on?
Just press the switch already!
What?
If you don't hurry up, we could die in here!
Soos, are you out of your...!
Turn it off!
Hey man, I'm sorry you had to lose your high score.
So, let me get this straight.
Your plan is to teach a bear to ride a bicycle?
Hey, have any of you seen my plate of spaghetti?
This is a dark day.
Thanks, Grunkle Stan.
You what?
That seems like a horrible idea!
Stan, what do you do in secret everyday during your lunch break?
Well, that was disturbing.
Uh, Grunkle Stan, why did you write this?
You might wanna, tuck that one away there.
I can't take it anymore, Mabel!
We need to take those teeth out of his mouth.
Could it possibly be any worse than this?
No, it's not true.
Right, Mabel?
Hey, you alright?
Mabel, it was for the greater good.
Mabel, we already know that story!
We just lived through it.
Guys, do you see that?
And I don't think any time has passed.
It must be some kind of wormhole.
All in favor of doing nothing all day say ugh.
Why would a sun need to wear sunglasses?
It's the hottest day of the year, Mabel.
Besides, can't you go for one week without having a new crush on some random guy?
Eh, Mabel's all talk.
You wanna know a secret?
She's never even kissed a guy before.
She always messes it up somehow.
Wow.
You work here?
Yeah, you do!
I've been laughing for too long, Soos!
Shh!
So, hey, you wanna go chuck more water balloons at Grunkle Stan?
Hey, hey.
What if I was the assistant lifeguard?
Your boss?
And that is why I think I'd make a good lifeguard assistant.
I think I can handle it.
Sure.
I guess.
Well, thanks, I, Yep.
Oh, this is happening.
Hey, Wendy, I got the job!
But what if Poolcheck catches us?
He seems emotionally unstable.
Poolcheck!
One hundred points!
All summer?
Poolcheck?
Are you crying?
I won't let you down!
Alright, Dipper, here's the plan.
Catch the trespasser, protect the supplies, keep job at pool, and eventually marry Wendy.
Freeze!
Grunkle Stan?
You!
You're the one destroying pool supplies!
Hey!
Who's there!
Mabel?
Is there anyone not breaking into the pool tonight?
What, is Soos here too?
Go home, Soos.
So, why are you here?
Did that cooler just clear its throat?
Mabel, I don't have time for your games.
If you don't give me those supplies, I'll lose the coolest job ever!
Really?
At night?
Hand over the pool supplies in the name of pool law!
Alright, the jig is up!
Hand over that cooler!
Why not?
Why do you even need it?
Whoa!
Way to bury the lead, Mabel.
Mermen don't breathe air!
I hate this!
I hate this!
Mabel, those are pool supplies.
I'll get fired!
Give Mermando the megaphone.
I don't remember the vampires.
Whoa!
Okay, that's gross.
Ugh.
Please don't involve me in this.
Yeah, yeah.
It's my fault, sir.
I'm sorry.
I got in too deep.
What?
Really?
How many?
Of course!
Alright, let a pro on the field, or floor.
Whatever.
Yes!
Stan shot.
Is that legal?
You're out of bounds!
Aw, again?
You can't leave mid-game.
Wait, what?
Oh no.
No no no.
Sleeping bags?
Rom-coms?
Calling All Boys: Preteen Edition?
You're not having a
Arrrrgh!
Mabel!
Do you think you can do this somewhere else?
You're laughing at frequencies only dogs should hear!
Hey, Soos, can I sleep in your break room tonight?
I think I'll sleep somewhere else...
Ah, sleeping under the stars, not bad.
Aaah!
Get off!
Aah!
Get away!
This is still better.
Mabel, last night an owl tried to eat my tongue.
No, it's not great!
This is impossible to live with!
Mabel, I've had it with the fun stick!
You've totally wrecked our room.
And, oh no!
Our mini-golf course!
Mabel, we need to lay down some ground rules if we're gonna be living in this room together.
First of all, no sleepovers.
How does reading keep you up?
Ooh, heh heh heh, interesting, but who stole the capers?
Well, at least my braces don't whistle when I breathe.
Washing clothes is a waste of time, I'm a busy guy!
Alright if you meow one more time
Okay, that's it!
That's the final straw!
Maybe we shouldn't share a room anymore.
Fine by me!
Then we need to talk to Grunkle Stan about moving rooms.
Grunkle Stan, we want different rooms.
Come on, Grunkle Stan.
Can't we work something out?
Whoa-hoh!
Experiment 78?
Grunkle Stan, what is this place?
Problem solved, I'll move in here!
Grunkle Stan, we're not gonna suck-up to you just to get the new room.
I mean—uh—yeah we are!
All these chores will be worth it when I get this room.
Shag carpeting?
Come on!
I say I'm gonna win this room somehow, and when I do I'll finally have my own space, and we'll never have to share anything ever again!
Am I in your body?
Aaah!
Aaah!
This isn't happening, this isn't happening, this isn't happening...
Great!
Just what we need, more Gravity Falls weirdness.
Ugh, braces are horrible.
It's like my mouth hates me.
And what are these things?
Hey look.
Experiment 78.
Electron Carpet.
Atoms can swap electrons.
This carpet must build up a static charge so powerful it can swap minds!
It was the static electricity!
Maybe we can use it to switch back!
And if I was you, which I am, I could sabotage myself!
Then Mabel would lose all her points and the room would go to Dipper!
Oh Stan!
I've always hated you!
Ha ha, see who he gives the room to now!
Grunkle Stan!
That's right.
It's me, Mabel.
If ya like that omelet you'll love this!
A sandwich made out of rocks!
Regular rocks.
Ha ha!
I mean, darn.
Mabel's gone bananas!
Zing!
Zow!
Ballow!
Wait!
Are you gonna dock Mabel points?
Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan, come back!
I have more terrible things to do!
You're toast, Mabel!
That room's as good as mine!
What!
No no no!
Look guys, I'm not really in a sleepover mood right now.
One of my, irrational girl mood swings, you know.
Right?
Don't we have those?
Uh, really.
I should probably, uh
NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Gotta win the room.
Stan!
It's me, Mabel!
I'm doing things you hate!
Ha ha!
Yes!
Alright!
Well, let's switch bodies then and I can start moving in.
Hey, come back!
Come on!
Arrgh!
Open the door, Dipper!
I mean, Mabel.
How am I ever gonna get in there?
Hmm, Hey girls, who wants to give my brother a makeover?
Good job ladies.
Now let me just add one, final, touch...
Ah my body.
I'm a genius, ha ha!
Ugh.
Alright, Mabel.
The room is mine!
Aw, come on!
Oh no!
Then again, I like having muscles for once.
Well, I guess I'm a pig now, so, that's a thing Om nom nom.
Give me that key, Mabel!
Mabel, are you you?
Well I've got the key!
Mabel, the room is mine!
Give it to me!
Me either!
I—I never wanted to move out.
Everything was fine until you started bringing your friends around every night.
I mean, hanging out with you this summer's been fun.
But, now you're always with Candy and Grenda, and I'm, like, just, left behind.
It's okay.
I've just been having a hard time, you wouldn't understand what I'm going through.
Yeah.
How'd you know?
Thanks.
Okay, pal, that's enough of that, move it along.
Ah, there.
That's right.
Finally.
Get rid of it.
Finally, my own room.
Good night Mabel.
Hey, um.
Do you want to have a sleepover?
I gave it to Soos to replace that horrible break room he has.
Hey, do you know what the deal was with that lady?
Do you have this T-shirt in my size?
I could play this game forever.
Coughing!
I was coughing!
Those weren't words!
Mabel?
How long have you been standing there?
Oh, no!
She got into the Smile Dip again!
Ugh.
Sev'ral Timez?
Aren't they that boy band that came a decade too late?
Mabel, you know all those boy bands are fake, right?
There's probably a machine that mass-produces them.
Yeah, pods, totally!
Ugh.
Girls.
Hey, is this the fingerless glove store?
I like things that are dumb.
I'm Robbie.
I'll just be, over here...
Alright Robbie, I saw that weird CD.
What the heck are you up to?
Guys, the weirdest thing just happened.
I think Robbie might be hypnotizing Wendy with his music.
We're the same age!
Um, I dunno...
You wouldn't understand.
This is gonna sound weird, but I think Robbie might be brainwashing Wendy with music.
Really?
So, wait, you actually believe my theory?
Oh, right.
Hey, guys.
How was the concert, and what's in the bag?
Alright, it took all day but I converted it to a record.
And now we can slow it down to see if the mind control message theory is correct.
Prepare to have your mind blown.
What?
Is that it?
Ugh!
This was so stupid!
Course there's no hidden mind control messages!
Mabel was right.
Wendy just likes the song.
She just likes Robbie.
Wait a minute.
Stan, rewind!
Ha ha!
I knew it!
It's mind control after all!
Oh no, I've got to save Wendy!
We gotta warn Wendy about the song before she get's brainwashed!
Wendy!
Stop!
Robbie's been lying to you!
Look, Wendy, you've got to hear this.
Uh, There's a message in there.
I swear!
Wait, wait!
Here.
I couldn't have done it without you, Grunkle Stan.
Um, hey!
Uh, now that your night is free, me and Grunkle Stan are thinking, maybe bowling, or something?
No, it's my fault.
I shouldn't have meddled in Wendy's personal life.
She probably hates me now.
You think she'll ever forgive me?
Thanks, Grunkle Stan.
Today's the day, Soos.
Thanks for coming along on this mission.
There's something hiding in these woods.
Something big enough to rip the roof off a car.
If we get a photo of this thing we'll be heroes!
Ha ha, shut up, man.
Here, give me a boost.
If everything goes according to plan, the creature will grab that steak, cross through the string, and set off cameras A, B, and C.
This was poorly planned...
We did it!
It tripped the wire!
Somewhere in one of these cameras is a photo of that creature!
I'll go develop the film.
C'mon, c'mon!
Hmm, That's a wing!
If camera B got the wing, then the one that should have gotten the rest is, camera C!
The creature!
I can't believe you, man!
Soos, no offense, but you gotta be more careful sometimes.
I mean, what are the odds we'll get another picture of...
How is it possible that a dinosaur survived 65 million years?
Took what?
Then, what happened?
You punched the pterodactyl in the face?
I thought you didn't even believe in the supernatural.
That's it.
No pterodactyl is gonna messes with MY sister.
We're gonna go out there, catch him, and save your pig!
For Mabel, guys!
It's pterodactyl.
Mabel.
We've got to talk.
This is a really high-stakes mission and I'm a little worried about Soos coming along on this one.
I love the guy, but sometimes he messes stuff up.
Soos, look.
I, uh, I've gotta tell you something.
Uh, p-terodactyl here we come!
Uh, ha ha...
What are YOU doing out here?
These plants look all Jurrasic-y.
They're trapped inside the tree sap!
That's how they survived for 65 million years!
Whoa.
The summer heat must be melting them loose!
Maybe, we should keep moving.
Arghhh!
Soos, you lost the trail!
Ugh!
That is it!
See, this is why I didn't want to bring you along!
I MEAN, this is really important to Mabel, and you keep screwing everything up!
You ruined our photograph, and now you got us hopelessly lost!
It's pronounced pterodactyl!
And these shirts are useless, they're gigantic!
Oh, so it's my fault?
Guys, we need a plan to get out of here.
Yeah, Mabel, we have to work together here.
Mabel, come back here!
Uh, Mabel?
Mabel, quick!
We gotta, now we gotta get out of here!
Look out!
McGucket, do you have an invention that can distract the pterodactyl?
What do we do, what do we do!
Soos, you've been wrong about stuff all day.
How can we...
Soos, you did it!
He's punching him in the face!
Quick!
The geyser could shoot us back up!
C'mon...
Go, go!
Check it out!
That thing destroyed my vest!
Soos, look!
Not as awesome as you saving us back there.
Pterodactyl bros?
Think we need to worry about the rest of those dinosaurs?
Yeesh.
Who actually buys these informercial stuff?
I'm gonna say...
I don't think you're playing this right.
Ugh, Gideon!
Uh, should we be worried about that?
What?
Why can't Mabel do it?
No way, Grunkle Stan!
You always make me do dumb chores.
I'm putting my foot down this time!
Okay, I'll do it!
Stupid chores...
Ow, ow!
Why does Grunkle Stan always pick on me?
Think about it!
The more painful or difficult the chore is, the more likely it is I'll have to do it.
Why doesn't he pick on you guys?
Sometimes I feel like Stan hates me.
What is going on in that guy's head?
Wait, what?
Triangle guy?
I feel like I've seen something like this before in the journal...
Beware Bill, the most powerful and dangerous creature I've ever encountered.
Whatever you do, never let him enter your mind.
Ugh, this is just great.
I spend all day cleaning sinks and fighting bats for Stan and now I have to save him from some crazy brain demon?
Fine.
Get ready, guys.
We're about to journey into the most horrifying, disturbing place any of us have ever been: our uncle's mind.
Okay, guys, in order to save our uncle, we're gonna have to follow that...
dream demon into his mind.
Soos!
This is serious!
Let's do this.
Videntus omnium.
Magister mentium.
Magnesium ad hominem.
Magnum opus.
Habeas corpus!
Inceptus Nolanus overratus!
Magister mentium!
Magister mentium!
MAGISTER MENTIUM!
Mabel!
What do you want with our uncle's mind anyway?
We're goin' in!
Mabel, can we leave those guys out here?
Looking at them, hurts my eyes...
Great.
Sure there's plenty of memories of Stan bossing me around, can't wait to see more of that.
Look, guys!
Memories about me!
I just wanna know what the old guy really thinks of me.
Okay.
Just a quick peek.
What's the point?
Why should I save him, huh?
I work for Stan day and night and all he does in return is say he wants to get rid of me.
I saw it with my own eyes in one of his memories, Mabel!
He always picked on me and now I know why.
Stan hates me!
You know what?
Not this time.
For once this is one of Stan's problems I'm not gonna fix.
Ugh!
How do I get out of this place?
Exit?
Hello?
Aw, this again?
I-I did it!
Ha ha!
Yes!
Wh-what the, How did you do that?
Well how about that?
Oh my gosh, what am I doing?
I gotta stop Bill!
Hey!
Bill!
Nice bow tie!
Guys!
I just learned that you can conjure whatever you can conceive in Grunkle Stan's mindscape!
Just think of cool fighting stuff and it will happen.
Like this!
And now to imagine your worst nightmare!
A portal out of Stan's mind!
Mabel!
Everyone, together!
He's gone!
we did it!
Stan must be waking up.
Grunkle Stan!
You're okay!
Nope!
It's a choke hold.
Hey, do you guys feel...
But... we defeated Bill!
Don't worry, guys!
It's just part of the dream!
We're gonna wake up any second now!
Right?
Right?
I just had a horrible dream that Gideon stole the deed to the Mystery Shack, and kicked us out, and, we all had to move in with Soos' grandma?
Uh, sorry, Abuelita.
I just can't believe Gideon beat us.
Normally I'm able to save the day.
This is all my fault.
Mabel, no offense, but that grappling hook has literally never helped us once.
We're in.
Don't worry, guys.
We'll get the shack back somehow.
What?
You're leaving town?
But we need you here!
What's Stan gonna tell Mom and Dad?
This would be a lot more fun with batteries.
But Grunkle Stan, you can't give up!
Mabel, that's enough.
If Stan won't get our home back from Gideon, then we'll have to do it ourselves.
The journal!
Alright, the bus to take us out of Gravity Falls comes at sundown.
If we wanna stay in town we've got to get past those guards, make it through the fence, and get Gideon to hand over that deed.
Now will you admit the grappling hook is useless?
Okay.
What can we use to defeat Gideon?
Let's see, Barf fairy?
Nope.
Butternut Squash with a Human Face and Emotions?
I stared at this page for hours.
It seems like a blueprint to build some kind of strange futuristic super-weapon, Wait a minute!
An army!
Mabel, that's it!
The gnomes!
I think this is their hiding spot.
Her name's Gideon, and she has lovely white hair.
Give us the deed to the shack, Gideon, or else.
Let go!
Oh no!
Give it back!
Give it back or I'll, NOOOOOO!
Well, that's it.
Guess the bus should be here soon.
The journal always has a plan!
Think about it, Mabel, Gideon was right.
The only courageous or cool things I've ever done have been because of that journal.
Without it, I can't help you, or Stan, or anyone.
What can we do?
Can't believe this is happening.
I'm not in the mood.
Giant robot!
He already won!
What does he want from us?
Soos, cliff!
I don't know what you're talking about!
You took the only journal I ever had!
What do you even want with these journals anyway?
Let go of her!
Let go of my sister!
Mabel, that was amazing!
Hey!
My journal!
Officers, he's lying!
Hey, Grunkle Stan, me and Mabel have been talking, And I think there's something we should finally tell you.
This is a journal I found in the woods.
It talks about all the crazy stuff that goes on in Gravity Falls.
Gideon nearly destroyed the whole town trying to find it.
I don't know what it means, or who wrote it.
But, after all we've been through, maybe you should finally know about it.
But it's all real!
Wait, no!
Grunkle Stan!
Stan, I need it!
Whoa.
Thanks, Mabel.
I still want it back though.
I don't know about that.
Hey, Grunkle Stan.
Now that we have a moment.
I've been meaning to ask you for my journal back.
Wait, you're just gonna give it to me?
Just like that?
I, I gotta go!
Mabel, we've gotta talk.
Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer, and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls.
Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal.
But why?
Who wrote it?
Where are all the other journals?
What was Bill talking about when he said everything was going to change?
There's something HUGE going on right under our noses.
And it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it.
I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.
I don't know why I tell you things, do you hear that?
Yeah, you never shut down the gift shop.
Wait!
Wait, did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?
Are you kidding me?
I'm investigating the exact same thing!
I found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers.
If we work together, we could crack the case!
We could talk right now!
Please please.
C-Come in!
I have so much to show you!
Wait!
No, wait!
We got so much to talk about!
But Grunkle Stan!
You don't understand!
Ugh!
That could've been my big break!
I'm not gonna raise the dead.
I just need a chance to show those agents my book!
It's not fair.
Finally I meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town, and Stan confiscates their card.
Ugh, if I go into Stan's room I could get in so much trouble.
Alright, Grunkle Stan.
Where did you hide that card?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Pretending I never saw that.
Wait a minute, Haha, yes!
I got it!
Hi, this is Dipper.
Th-The kid from the Mystery Shack.
The one with the, um, sweating problem.
 I have that journal I wanted to show you!
I'm a hundred percent positive.
Yes, there is!
After everything that's happened you have to know that by now.
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.
Working together we can crack all of the big questions of Gravity Falls!
Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for.
I'm thinking full scale investigation.
Forensics, researchers.
Do you guys have a helicopter?
I'm sorry, helicopters.
No, no, no!
It's real, I swear!
You should send it to the lab.
Am I saying that right?
WAIT!
This book is real.
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!
LISTEN!
Uh, uh, Corpus Levitus!
Diablo Dominus!
MONDO VICIUM!
Ha, a zombie!
A real, actual, zombie.
See?
Spooky journal, 100% real.
Now can we work together?
It's just one zombie, trust me I see stuff like this all the time
Whew.
Oh, good thing it was just that one.
Oh my gosh!
You guys can help right?
OH, MY GOSH, WHAT HAVE I DONE?
Raise the dead.
Raise the dead.
ZOMBIES!
Quick!
The golf cart!
Aw, come on!
Stay back!
How's he supposed to help?
He doesn't even believe in the supernatural!
Quick!
We need to board up all the windows!
Okay, maybe that'll hold 'em.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT WEAKNESSES!
This can't be happening.
I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger.
Now we're toast, it's all my fault, and no one can save us!
Ah, NO!
MABEL, I'M SORRY!
Grunkle, Grunkle Stan?
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
Are you alright!
Heh heh, well, at least you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?
Wait, what are you talking about?
Well, normally the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies!
It's hopeless!
What?
All this time I thought I knew all the journal's secrets, but they're written in some kind of invisible ink!
This is it!
Zombies have a weakness!
Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony.
Three part harmony, how can we create that?
I have a naturally high-pitched scream...
I never agreed to that name.
Friday night, and we're gonna party 'til dawn.
Don't worry, Daddy, I've got my favorite dress on?
Mabel, this is stupid!
Takin' over tooniiiiight!
I'm sorry about this, guys.
I totally ruined everything.
Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.
Wait!
There's a page in here about curing zombification.
It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
Come on Soos, let's fix you up.
I can't believe it!
All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight!
A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore...
Man, these movies are a lot less scary when you actually fought real zombies.
How much you want to bet that guy dies first?
Oh, yeah!
Robbie.
How's, uh, how's all that going?
And you're not, not like, seeing any other guys or, Right, right.
So, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to maybe if, you know, you and me, whatever.
I mean if maybe you wanted to join me and Mabel on this mystery hunt?
Tomorrow?
Conspiracy stuff and all that?
Yeah, that's what we are.
That's all we'll ever be.
Friends.
Thank you all for coming.
We're here to solve the number one mystery in Gravity Falls; who wrote this journal?
Thirty years ago the author vanished without a trace.
But according to this new clue, we may have found his secret hiding place.
We find that author, we learn the answers to everything.
We just need to figure out a way to get down there.
Oh, hey!
You came.
Of course, anytime you wanna... I, we're always...
No, look I've thought this through and I'm over Wendy.
I've looked at it from every angle, and that thing was going nowhere.
I know what matters to me now, and it's finding the author of this journal.
I've moved on, Mabel.
You should too.
Huh, yeah.
But how do we get up there, It seems we'd need like a ladder, or like, ladder shoes, Yeah, ladder shoes.
I'll get Soos to draw up a prototype.
Alright guys, this is it.
Remember, whatever happens down there, we tell no one.
Now, who wants to go first?
It's like a fallout shelter or something.
It must've belonged to the author.
This is incredible!
It's like he was preparing for a disaster.
But what kinda disaster would need supplies for over sixty years?
Wait guys, I think this can was opened recently.
Oh, come on!
Find these four symbols!
Quick!
Everybody step on one!
Haha, thanks.
What did you, Give me that!
No, I changed my mind; it's a bad idea.
I'd embarrass myself and then I'd be another guy she hates, like Robbie.
Look, Mabel, I can't tell her no matter how much I want to, so just drop it OK?
Coming!
This never happened.
What the...? MABEL!
Let us out!
Nothing!
Mabel's just been eating raw sugar packets again.
Let me out RIGHT NOW!
Whoa!
A hidden lab!
Maybe the author did experiments down here.
Lets hope we don't find out.
Mabel, open up, for real!
There's a monster in here!
Wendy, I— I— I'm gonna find another way out!
I don't know!
It's, it's you!
You don't understand, you're the guy I've been looking for!
Wendy, he's the guy!
I've got like a gillion questions!
Why did you write the journals?
Who was after you?
Why did you build this bunker?
Dude!
I found one of them!
That's how I tracked you down here.
Wendy!
Isn't it amazing we're actually meeting the real author?
Uhh, you know what?
We should probably get going.
Can I have my journal back?
You!
What did you do to the real author?
We've gotta get that journal back!
RUN!
RUN!
RUN!
Wait!
How do we know they're not the shape shifter?
It's definitely them.
Oh my gosh, Wendy, you're bleeding!
Imagine if he escapes to the town!
He can transform into anything!
We could never trust anyone ever again!
Guys, he's coming!
He's coming!
NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!
HEY, LET GO!
WENDY!
Wendy!
No, no, no-no-no!
Can you hear me?
Oh, please be okay, please be okay!
Oh no, oh no!
This is all my fault!
If I had told you when we were in the closet we wouldn't be in this mess.
But I was too scared and now you could be hurt or worse, and I never even got to tell you I'm, like—In love with you, Wendy!
Huh—wha—Wendy?
W-wait, then who's, LOOK OUT!
Uh, uh, I don't know who's who!
Give me a sign!
Push him in!
Look, Wendy, about earlier.
In the heat of the moment, I might have said some dumb things, and can't we pretend none of that ever happened?
Please?
Wait, you did?
Oh man!
Mabel said confessing would make me feel better.
Anxious.
Scared.
Kinda itchy.
So things won't be too, awkward, now?
Friends?
Wha—what did you hear?
Mabel, how can everything be so amazing and so terrible all at the same time?
Thanks Mabel.
Whoa!
Soos, that's not a briefcase, it's a laptop!
This could be our next clue!
Is it just me or does Gravity Falls TV only have the worst movies?
You want to never watch this channel again?
Looks like someone bought their way to the front page.
Aw, cheer up Mabel!
I mean, no one even reads newspapers anymore.
Hey, Mabel!
You love mini-golf!
She's been amazing at it since we were kids!
What do you say, Mabel?
We've had a stressful couple of days.
How 'bout we take a break, huh?
Come on, Mabel!
Victory!
The grass is fake, but the fun is real!
There's something here for everyone!
Focus!
Focus!
And, eh, I'll take what I can get.
Grunkle Stan, you ain't seen nothing yet!
Guys, this is amazing!
If Mabel gets a hole in one here, she'll beat her all-time high score!
I got this!
Hey, Pacifica!
How's that whole your family being a frauds thing working out for you?
Yeah!
If you beat her at this, she can never rag on you again.
Imagine it!
Ugh, I don't get it!
What is wrong with this hole?
Did you hear that?
Grab your club.
What is this?
And so needlessly complicated!
Eh, we're good.
These guys are a riot!
Pst!
Mabel!
This is perfect!
These guys control the course!
Just tell them you'll give the sticker to whichever group does a better job of helping us win!
Pacifica's rich, Mabel.
She's cheating at life.
Thanks, man.
Ha, ha!
Miner hole.
I wonder what cute, silly things are going on down there.
Hey, little hi-fives everyone, little hi-fives all around.
Nice one, You did it, You're the man.
I can't wait to see the look on Pacifica's face when we win.
I'm thinking it'll be like ugh.
You know how she does that?
Ugh.
Ah, just enjoy your victory, Mabel.
Trust me, Pacifica will be fine.
This wasn't part of the deal, tiny Dutchman!
We gotta get out of here!
Don't freak out, man!
The water's shallow!
There's literally no way to drown!
Seriously?
Get on, get on!
They're shutting us in!
So are you guys, like, cool now?
Should have charged her for that taco.
Alright, Mabel, today is the big day.
Soos finally fixed up the laptop.
If this thing works, we could learn the identity of The Author and unravel the greatest mysteries of Gravity Falls.
You ready?
This is it.
This is it.
Aha!
It worked.
Ugh!
Of course, a password.
Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah, I forgot about Mermando.
Did not care for Mermando.
Okay, this cryptology book says that there's 7.
2 million 8-letter words.
I'll type, you read.
Okay, Mabel?
Mabel?
Huh, So, how'd it go?
What?
Mabel, are you serious?
What about cracking this password?
You know, mystery twins?
All right, okay, Okay, okay, okay, shhhh...
I can't wait to get to the bottom of this laptop.
We're close to something big here; I can feel it...
Yeah, um.
That's sounds great.
Ugh, wrong password, WRONG, WRONG!
UGH!
Pleh.
Just a few more tries.
Ugh, I can't take that sound anymore.
Hate. You. Sound.
There has to be some shortcut or clue.
Who would know about secret codes?
AAA!
AAA!
AAAAAAA!
You again!
Hardly.
You worked with Gideon!
You tried to destroy my uncle's mind!
Really?
I'd never do a favor for you!
Don't forget who defeated you last time!
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Hey Mabel.
Mabel, listen, last night I had a dream with Bill in it.
He said he'd give me the code to the laptop if I gave him something.
Like I'd actually trust Bill, right?
Production crew?
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, you just said you were going to help me!
Mabel, do you seriously think that your random crush of the week is more important than uncovering the mysteries of this town?
You're obsessed!
But you said you were going to help me today!
Okay, fine!
You know what?
I'll do it on my own!
Passwords.
Passwords.
Mabel.
Useless.
Oh, man, Noonono!
I'm gonna lose everything?
I only have one more try?
I thought I told you to leave me alone.
Uh, what crazy thing do you want anyway?
To eat my soul?
To rip out my teeth?
Are you gonna replace my eyes with baby heads or something?
A puppet?
What are you playing at?
I don't know, man.
Mabel worked really hard on these.
Uh, just one puppet?
Fine!
So what puppet are you gonna pick, anyway?
Huh?
This can't be happening!
What did you do to my body?
Oh my gosh, this can't be happening.
This can't be happening!
I don't understand!
Why are you doing this?
I thought we had a deal!
I've hidden it!
Somewhere you'll never find it in a million years!
Wait!
No, Mabel, don't listen to him!
That's not me!
You've gotta hear me!
No, no!
Wait!
Stop!
Soos!
Wendy!
Help me!
I'm gonna stop you, Bill!
I'm gonna find that journal before you do and I'm gonna stop you!
Bill?
Bill!
I gotta get my body back before he does something crazy with it.
Oh, no!
Wait!
Mabel!
Hey!
Listen!
Have you seen Mabel?
What did Bill say?
I can't be heard without a vessel?
Where would I find a-
Pst, Mabel!
Mabel, it's me, Dipper!
You need to help me!
Mabel, you have to listen.
Bill tricked me!
He stole my body and now he's after the journal!
You have to find the journal before Bill destroys it.
It's the only hope to get me back in my body!
Mabel!
Mabel!
You want me to be a sock puppet forever?
Gabe!
You're back from the war!
I hope this kiss never ends!
I'm giving you away.
You are a woman now.
Waddles, the rings!
Wait, what?
Oh no.
Hey!
Yes!
I'm in my own body!
And it's, just as underwhelming as I remember.
Ooh, everything hurts.
Did he just make out with his puppets?
Oof.
Mabel, I'm sorry about all this.
It's my fault your puppets got ruined.
Mystery twins.
What'd Bill do to my hand?
Ahh!
Seriously, I need to go to the hospital.
I don't know Mabel, what?
Soos?
What was that all about?
Soos, you help us so much, it's time we help you, dude.
We're gonna get you that date.
Yeah! ...Wait, what?
Well, I guess you are better at games than at flirting.
Hey, have you guys seen Soos?
We're supposed to help him with match-making today.
We're going back to the mall, man.
You need to unplug!
And, here comes security.
I'll deal with this.
Stay here and practice on some real girls.
We saw the whole thing, Soos.
That was amazing!
You talked to a real girl, and you got a date!
You were in the zone, you made eye contact - it was like you'd done this a million times before.
Don't you see?
That game really worked!
Soos, can a computer game go to Reggie's engagement party with you?
Now, DATE!
Soos, get a grip on yourself.
GIFfany can't stalk you because she's not real!
Take it from someone who brought an arcade game to life, this will not end well.
On three we split.
One, two...
Have you been following us all day?
Professor glasses!
They make me look like a genius!
Grunkle Stan, are you seriously shoplifting from a witch?
That sounded like a curse.
I told you, Grunkle Stan.
You gotta give that watch back and apologize.
Guys, can you stop tapping both my shoulders?
Yeah, you're just making stuff up now.
So this was all just a ploy to get a date?
The What-the-heck-ahedron.
Solve this puzzle and your photo could get on this box.
Woah.
That's false advertising I can get behind.
Come on, Ugh!
Mabel, could you knock it off?
I'm trying to solve this intelligence puzzle but it seems impossible.
...We'll see about that.
Buried near the falls is the legendary Percepshroom.
To increase brainpower, grind it up and apply to forehead overnight Tomorrow, I own you!
Ha-ha!
I feel smarter already!
The digits of pi are three point one, uh...
What?
Who said that?
Mabel?
The brain goop!
You ate it and built all this, didn't you?
Woah!
What-the-heck-ahedron!
How did you do that?
Man, I am loving this new Waddles.
Dude, that rocket cart is amazing.
You and me should go invent stuff!
Mabel, this pig's got a gift.
He needs to share it with the world!
I bet we could be of service.
Dude, that rocket pack we made is amazing.
This is your greatest invention yet!
It could solve every problem of mankind!
Solving that brain puzzle was just the tip of the iceberg, With this, Waddles will be able to solve all the greatest puzzles of the UNIVERSE.
Soon, your pig is gonna be famous!
Meeting with scientists, presidents...
I wonder if I could teach him to wear pants.
Waddles, Waddles, don't!
WAIT!
Our invention!
Yeah, guess so.
Good pig.
Uggh.
Everything about this is bad.
Oh no.
Mabel!
Oh, Grunkle Stan, I should have told you before.
Mabel has a childhood terror of old-timey stop-motion animation.
It's like her number one fear since we were kids.
Why did you have to show her that tape?
Hello?
Claymore?
Aha!
See, Mabel?
It's all just special effects.
You can come out.
How is this happening?
What do they want?
What?
But how are these things real?
What about stop motion?
Mabel, you did it!
So you're not scared anymore?
Well, I think today we learned that you can remold your fears.
Trust me, just let her be Xs.
Alright author, who are you?
Who are you?
, Blech!
Not again.
Yay, a filthy green bottle!
I wouldn't get your hopes up, Mabel.
And there it is.
Oh, Mabel.
You'll get over him eventually.
Hey, if it's any consolation, my summer mission isn't a huge success either.
I'm still trying to find the author of this journal, but with this laptop smashed, I've lost any lead in finding him.
Through your bottle?
McGucket Labs.
Wait, Old Man McGucket?
Couldn't be...
Doesn't make any sense, unless, This matches with this, This goes over here, And then the name, So that would mean...
Old Man McGucket wrote the journals?
Wendy, Soos, we need to go see Old Man McGucket!
Old Man McGucket, are you here?
You can drop the act, McGucket.
I know you're the author.
You studied the mysteries of this town and wrote this book.
What about this book?
Are you sure you didn't write it?
Here, look closely.
Who did?
What if McGucket learned something he wasn't supposed to know, and someone, or something, messed with his mind?
We've got to get to the bottom of this.
That's where we're going.
All right, keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious.
So your last memory was here.
Anything coming back?
Hey, who's there?
It doesn't make sense.
Where did he go?
Wait, they are!
Move aside.
A secret passageway.
I have no idea what that means.
Oh my gosh.
They erased Lazy Susan's memory.
Guys, are you seeing this?
They just wiped Lazy Susan's memory!
Amazing.
A secret society of evil mind erasers.
I'll bet they erased your memory a long time ago.
If we could find where your memories have been hidden, it could be the key to unlocking all the mysteries of Gravity Falls.
All right, Mabel, Wendy, you two stay here and make sure those robe guys don't come back.
Soos, you, me, and McGucket are gonna go find the Hall of the Forgotten.
Follow that hat!
Whew!
There it is.
Hurry!
Whoa, look at this.
Why are they erasing peoples' memories?
I still don't get it.
Okay, I think we're safe.
Why are you doing this?
Bud Gleeful?
Why would you do all this?
What do you have to gain?
Mabel?
Seriously?
Don't you see?
This is ruining lives!
What about Old Man McGucket?
He lives in a hut and talks to animals, thanks to you.
Don't you feel bad about that?
Sometimes I use big words, and I don't actually know what they mean.
I mean, I'm supposed to be the smart guy.
If I'm not the smart guy, who am I?
McGucket's memory tube.
Mabel, catch!
Never!
That memory belongs to McGucket.
McGucket, you took a bullet for me.
Oh my gosh!
Are you okay?
It's pretty funny.
Oh, I think you just might.
Say cheese.
Thanks for visiting the Museum for Gold Miner Appreciation Night.
Be sure to tip the gold miner on your way out.
Oh, might have overdone that one.
All right, McGucket, are you ready to see your memories?
Find out who you really are?
Still don't know what that means.
So, wait.
You weren't the author, but you worked with him.
Do you remember who he was?
It's trapped!
Soos, you are the greatest human ever to live.
Whoa!
Better makes sure he gets his wallet back.
I don't know if we should be, Wo-oah!
Soos has a membership to Laser Tag?
Ha ha, I didn't know they let grown-ups in there.
Jésus Alzamirano Ramirez. Organ donor. Birthday: July 13th.
Wait a minute.
That's today.
That's weird.
I wonder why he didn't tell anyone.
We've shared every birthday together, so we know how to make them perfect.
Hey.
places everyone!
I hear footsteps!
Soos, what's wrong?
No one should be alone on their birthday.
There's gotta be a way to cheer him up.
We just have to try harder.
Don't worry, Soos.
As soon as you start playing with us, you're gonna have a great time.
Oh no!
Soos!
Blar-blar!
Look, we're sorry about all that, but we're in the middle of something really important right now.
I have an idea.
Okay!
I think, I've, got it!
Oh, no, look!
Mabel, the laser place is a mattress store!
We went too far in the past!
Okay.
We just gotta to go forward 10 years.
We can be back before Soos even realizes we were gone.
M-m-maybe.
I need some tools.
And I think I know where to get some.
Let's try to lay low.
We don't want to change the future.
Or cause the future.
I forget how this works exactly.
Thank you.
I mean, you're super young, so this is weird.
Heh heh, yeah, I-uh.
Huh.
Wow.
Wooow, Alright.
The coast is clear.
Hah!
Bingo.
Alright, let's see, Alright.
I think I've got this thing working.
Way.
Alright.
But let's be quick.
Man, I don't know why Soos hate his birthdays, this looks great.
So that's why Soos hates his birthday.
It's the day he realized his dad wasn't coming back.
We promised Soos a happy birthday, but how can we give him that now?
This goes beyond anything we know how to fix.
Uh-oh.
Hide!
Wait, Mabel, that's it!
The time wish!
If we defeat Blendin in that space battle...
And Soos' birthdays would be fixed forever.
All of them.
It's the only chance we have.
Besides, it's for Soos.
He would do the same for us.
Here we are Blendin.
We surrender.
Look guys, no tricks this time.
We're ready to challenge you, okay?
Dream on.
There's two of us.
Laser tag?
Seriously?
Mabel, grab the orb!
So Blendin did try to wish us out of existence, but it was kind of our fault for ruining his life.
Maybe if we treat him right in the present, he'll turn out better in the future.
Okay.
As long as you keep an eye on him, we'd like to set Blendin free, and restore his position at the Time Anomaly Correction Unit.
We're so sorry we left you hanging dude.
We got caught up in this time travel junk...
And don’t forget about the...
We think the only thing that can make you happy is meeting your dad.
What are you waiting for, Soos?
What the...?
But Soos, what about meeting your dad?
Oh yeah, okay, cool.
It does.
Clouds don't come in colors.
That is a balloon.
Wait, the wood what?
Whoa!
Like a real concert concert?
I've never actually been to one of those before.
Thompson, go look.
Come on, Mabel, it's Robbie.
Mabel, trust me.
If there's one thing I've learned this summer, it's not to get mixed up in needless romantic drama.
Besides, we're finally in with Wendy's friends.
With Robbie gone, there's a good social balance.
Maybe we should let the good thing be, you know.
Oh, well, I don't know about
Guys, guys.
Calm down.
We're gonna be late for the concert.
But we were all starting to finally hang out together.
I was one of the gang.
Mabel, what did I tell you about staying out of Robbie's personal life?
Wait, love potion?
If you did a spell, then can't you, like, undo it?
I know.
Ugh, they're doing that couple hug walk.
Guys you're in public!
People can see you!
Sounds good to me.
Good one.
Agh!
No, no, no.
Everyone is touching everything!
Ugh.
You really think we'd fall for that?
Dang it, Mabel.
They're not real.
Mabel don't!
Mabel it's a trick.
Don't give him the
Love God?
Are you okay?
Okay, Mabel.
Now's our chance.
They break up and the whole friend group gets back together.
They are kinda perfect for each other in a gross kinda way.
But what about our friend group?
Maybe someone up there really is a genius matchmaker.
Be strong, bladder.
We're not gonna move till sunset.
Aww, what?
Okay, can someone please explain why people care about this?
Guys, in case you've already forgotten, Pacifica Northwest is the worst.
And that's not just jealousy talking.
I'd say that to her face.
You're the worst.
And why should I trust you?
All you've ever done is try to humiliate me and Mabel.
What?
Mabel, this is Pacifica we're talking about!
Ugh.
Fine!
I'll bust your ghost.
But, in exchange, I'll need three tickets to the party.
I'll do my best.
Ugh, it's like this collar is strangling me.
Who do you guys think you're impressing with this stuff?
Funny, I thought it was lying about founding the town.
Yep, this looks like the kind of room that would be haunted, all right.
I wouldn't worry about it, though.
Ghosts fall on a ten-category scale.
Floating plates sound like a Category 1.
Just gotta splash this sucker with some anointed water , and he should be out of your probably-fake blonde hair.
Shh!
I'm picking something up.
C'mon, stupid thing.
There we go.
Uh, Pacifica?
It's a Category 10.
Don't worry.
It can't get worse than this!
I'm looking!
And it's not dumb, okay?
This book is gonna save our lives!
Alright, here we go.
Advice: Aww, seriously?
Come on, come on...  I got it!
Haunted paintings can only be trapped in a silver mirror.
Look!
There's a silver mirror right there!
What?
Are you serious?
Pacifica, we don't have time for this!
Let me through!
Why are you so afraid of your parents?
Ahh...
What is this place?
Hopefully the ghost doesn't either.
Pacifica, watch out!
A silver mirror!
Hey, just holding up my end of the deal.
Heh, I'd love to stay, but I've got a Category 10 ghost to dispose of.
Aah!
Heh heh, Category 10.
Call me crazy, but, maybe she's not that bad after all.
What are you laughing about, man?
I defeated you.
What do you mean?
So, wait a minute.
The Northwests knew this haunting was coming, and they tricked me into helping them to avoid ghostly justice?
, I'll be right back.
Northwests!
You've got some explaining to do!
You lied to me!
All of you did!
All you had to do was let the townsfolk into the party and you could've broken the curse!
But you made me do your dirty work instead!
My kind?
I was right about you all along.
You're just as bad as your parents.
Another link in the world's worst chain!
Stupid Northwests, making me do their exorcism for them.
Exodus demonus, spookus scarus, aintafraidus noghostus...
Hey, I feel you.
It's just, my sister's in there, and you seem a little unstable, man.
Uh, I guess.
Go nuts, man.
Oh no!
Mabel!
Whoa, that is messed up!
A Northwest?
...Pacifica!
Pacifica!
There you are!
The ghost is turning everyone to wood, and he just started rhyming, for some reason?
I need your help!
Pacifica?
Pacifica, I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
But just because you're your parents' daughter doesn't mean you have to be like them.
It's not too late.
Alright ghost, prepare to get, ah!
No, wait!
No no no!
No, someone help!
SOMEONE HEEEELLLLP...
Man, if your family hates you for this, they're idiots.
This is great.
Hey.
Guess what we're standing on.
Whoa-ho-ho, what's up, McGucket?
Hey, You know what, McGucket?
How about we talk about this stuff tomorrow?
It's a party.
Let's have some fun for once, huh?
If it was worth waking up at seven AM for, that will be amazing.
Seriously?
The greatest uncle!
The government guys?
I thought you got eaten by zombies!
Hmm, wait a minute, the security tapes!
Didn't Stan say he was restocking the gift shop last night?
If we could get the Mystery Shack surveillance tapes, we could prove he's innocent!
You you don't know what you're talking about.
Mabel, aren't you forgetting the simpler solution?
Alright.
If I was Stan, where would I hide those surveillance tapes?
Don't you mean jackalope?
There it is!
Stan restocking like he said!
And the date shows it was last night!
It's proof!
He's innocent!
...Uhh-oh.
Oh no, Stan, you didn't...
That's him, alright.
Mabel, I'm not so sure about that...
Hal Forrester?
Andrew '8-Ball' Alcatraz?
These are fake IDs, Mabel!
You wouldn't need these unless you were trying to hide your real identity!
WHAT?
Stan Pines Dead?
Unnamed grifter at large?
Why would they call him unnamed?
Unless Stan, Stan Pines is dead?
Then who have we been living with?
It doesn't make any sense!
I can't believe it.
This whole summer I've been looking for answers and the biggest mystery was right under our nose.
Let me see that.
A1, B, C3, I've never seen a code like this.
What are you doing here?
Soos, listen.
Something huge is going on here.
If Stan is hiding some dangerous secret, we need to find out what it is!
I need you to step aside.
...Or a nightmare.
This can't be real, It's just like that bunker in the woods, It can't be, it's impossible.
The other two journals?
All this time, all this time, Stan had them?
I can't believe it!
Was anything he said to us real?
Why would he have those journals?
Or maybe he stole them from the author!
Maybe the reason he has all those fake IDs is because he is a master criminal, and this machine is his master plan!
I was wrong the whole time.
The machine was meant to create knowledge but it is too powerful.
I was deceived, and now it is too late.
The device, if fully operational, could tear our universe apart!
It must not fall into the wrong hands.
If the clock ever reaches zero, our universe is doomed!
The agents were right!
We have to shut it down!
There!
Quick!
Turn these, together!
That's it!
The shutdown switch!
This all stops, now!
And I should trust you why?
After you stole radioactive waste?
After you lied to us all summer?
I don't even know who you are!
Mabel!
Hurry!
Shut it down!
Mabel, press the red button!
Shut it down!
Mabel, what if he's lying?
This thing could destroy the universe!
Listen to your head!
He's lying!
Shut it down NOW!
MABEL, ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE'RE ALL GONNA...
What, Who is that?
I-I can't believe it.
You're the author of the journals!
I haven't just read them; I've lived them!
I've been waiting for so long to meet you, I-I don't know what to say I have so many question I Oooooohhh I think I'm gonna throw up.
Hmmpf!
No-no, false alarm.
Hmmpf!
Just gotta ride it out!
Stanley?
Yeah, Grunkle Stan, no more lies!
You owe us some answers: What's the deal with this portal?
Why did you keep this a secret?
But, wait, what about you?
Did you end up going to your dream school?
THE JOURNALS!
Sorry, sorry, just got excited there, About the journals, Keep-keep talking.
So all this time you were just trying to save your brother.
Grunkle Stan, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.
Wait, forget.
That's it!
I think I know a way we might be able to defeat those agents!
Sure!
Thanks, Great Uncle Ford.
So, uh, would you mind if I ask you a couple billion questions about Gravity Falls?
But, it's the author!
I've been waiting so long to ask questions about-
I don't know if this is good or bad.
I wanted to meet the author, but...
Eh, I'm sure they'll work things out.
Well.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupider than you, dum-dum.
Good night, stupid.
What is it?
Great uncle Ford!
You need any help with that?
I've read all about these creatures in your journal, and I think I know how to...
Maybe next time then?
Or not?
Or never.
But, Grunkle Stan, all summer long I've wanted to know who the author of the journal was.
Now the guy lives in our basement and I can't even talk to him.
Mabel!
You'll never guess what I found at the store today!
No, it's my favorite fantasy-talking, level-counting, statistics and graph paper-involving game of all time: Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons!
You wanna play it with me?
The rules are simple.
First, you roll a 38-sided die to determine the level of each player's statistical analysis poweroid.
These orbs relate directly to the amount of quadrants that your team has dominion over, which is inverse to the anti-quadrants in your quadrant satchel.
And no.
First, we make a graph.
Come on, Mabel, I need at least two people to play.
Huh.
Hey, Soos, up for a little game of D&D&MoreD?
A wha...?
Well, thanks anyway, Soos.
Yes!
It is!
You wanna play with me, Grunkle Stan?
Hey!
Laugh all you want.
You guys just aren't smart enough to understand it.
Oh, nice!
You rolled a seventeen!
Aaannd this is sad.
Maybe I should start obsessing over Wendy again.
Hey, give it back!
Come on, Gompers, let go!
Aw, man, my 38-sided die!
Whoa, what AAAAAHHHH!
Great uncle Ford!
Yeah!
Y-you know that game?
They do!
And I've been looking all day for someone to play it with me!
You know his weakness, right?
Yes!
In your face, you cardboard wizard!
Mmm, yeah, they change the art every few years.
Thankfully you missed the period when the creators of the game tried to make it cooler.
Must have been dark times, those 90's.
Great uncle Ford, I've been meaning to ask you: where were you before you came out of that machine, and what have you been doing down here?
Are you working on something behind that curtain?
But, but I can handle it, Woah, that's so cool.
And, impossible!
Hohoho man.
And then, if I had a dragon here, and then a plus three fire mode...
Sorry, Mabel, I got to finish this dungeon.
It's going to totally stump Great uncle Ford tomorrow, I can't wait to see the look on his face.
You have no idea.
I knew the author must be cool, but he's better than I imagined.
And, he doesn't make fun of me all the time, like you and Grunkle Stan do.
You got me!
Grunkle Stan, wait!
Have you come to send us on the quest of a lifetime because we're the smartest players you've ever met?
What do we do?
What do we do?
There better be something protective under this tunic.
Oh, no, there isn't!
Hey, I'm not sure this is such a good, Oh boy.
Whoa!
There are no moves; you make them up!
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
How did you know you'd win?
Actually, after all that, I could use a little mindless fun.
Really?
Even though I got us into the whole game-playing mess?
Oh-uh, of course.
Goodnight, Great uncle Ford.
Whoa, what's going on?
Wait, Bud Gleeful?
Guys, I've got a really bad feeling about Bud Gleeful as mayor.
It's a shame Ford isn't here, he'd run.
And win!
And be a great mayor!
No no, it's okay, Mabel.
We don't think you can do it.
Psst, Mabel, let's talk.
I know Stan isn't the best candidate.
Heck, he's committing voter fraud right now.
But Bud's definitely up to something, and we're the only ones who can stop him.
Alright everybody, eyes up here!
Okay, Gravity Falls Elections are based on two events.
The Wednesday Stump Speech, held on an actual, stump, and the Friday Debate wherein townsfolk throw birdseed at the candidate they like most.
At the end, they release a freedom eagle who will fly to the candidate covered in more seed and bestow a birdly kiss upon him anointing him mayor.
I couldn't make this up if I wanted to.
Okay, interview's over.
Candy, what's the damage?
From now on, maybe you should read our prepared remarks.
And he's insisting on speaking his mind!
The Stump Speech is in a couple of days, and if he continues like this, we'll lose to Bud for sure!
Whoa!
This is amazing!
And ethically ambiguous!
Thank you Great Uncle Ford!
Flip the switch and test it out!
Jump in!
jump in!
Power tie, gotta wear it.
Suit and tie, gotta wear it.
Grunkle Stan, we'd respect you if you took things more seriously!
Dumb advice?
Dang it, Stan!
Every one of those speeches we were controlling you!
This tie is a mind control device invented by Ford!
If it wasn't for this tie, you'd be losing!
Stan, wait!
You can't, Augh, this is bad.
If we wanna beat Bud, we need another candidate, fast!
We're getting eaten alive back there!
Since when is Bud been, creepily adorable?
Gideon!
I knew you were somehow behind this!
You've been controlling Bud!
We're tied to a bunch of fireworks!
Oh no!
We have to get out of here!
Well, guess we know who won.
Aw, I'm sorry, Stan.
I actually think you as mayor would've been fun.
Grunkle Stan, are you crying?
He-hey, vandalism!
Alright, Grunkle Stan's gotta have some decent board games.
Hey, what's this?
What Could Go Wrong?
The last players who opened this box never made it out alive.
This should take up the next 21 minutes.
Know him?
He's been terrorizing us all summer!
I have so many questions and theories...
The important thing is we defeated him twice.
It was a lot more heroic than it sounds.
So, how do you know Bill?
That's not, like, rare, is it?
I can't argue there.
So, what are the odds she gets that hair?
So, what are we gonna do about Bill?
So what is Bill, exactly?
So how do we keep Bill out of our minds?
Heheh.
Good one.
Oh, man, I can't believe I'm with the author.
Is my fly down?
DISCO GIRL! COMING THROUGH!
Wendy.
Wendy.
Wendy.
Wendy.
You might wanna, ignore that last one.
By the way, you never told me what your history with Bill was.
Well, yeah, but...
Ugh, this is taking forever.
How long have I been doing this for?
Why does he have to be so mysterious about Bill?
I can handle the truth.
I wonder what Great Uncle Ford is thinking.
Use the machine!
It'll show you his thoughts.
I shouldn't...
He won't know.
He's going to tell you eventually.
The more you know about Bill, the more you can help.
Man, I am really good at rationalizing.
Yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are.
Just a little peek.
What are you hiding about Bill?
FORD AND BILL?
Why, why were you shaking hands with Bill?
You said Bill could possess anyone so he could get this.
Ahh!
Why were you really scanning my thoughts?
Are you Bill right now?
PINE TREE?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA CALL ME?
Great Uncle Ford told me to protect the rift!
Get one step closer and I'll shoot!
I'll erase you right out of Ford's head!
Trust no one, trust no one, trust...
Let go of me!
I tried to erase your mind.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, man.
Ugh, I'm so embarrassed about earlier.
I'm such an idiot.
But what about Bill?
I broke the machine!
Now we have no way to protect the shack!
Uh, no, actually?
Whoa.
An RV?
Camping gear?
Are you running from the law again?
Uh, nothing!
Just, Wendy stuff, from old times.
Ahh, I know, I know!
I know she's not interested and I know it's over, but how do you just turn off the way you feel about someone?
Okay.
Like Soos said, meet new people.
So, uh, come here often?
You're funny.
And cute.
I mean, not cute.
I mean, you're not not cute.
Phew, let me start over.
My name is Dopper.
Ahh, I'm so embarrassed.
Look, earlier this summer I ruined my chances with Wendy.
And I wanna move on, but I'm terrible at talking to girls.
The moment I open my mouth around them I unravel like, like, well, I can't think of a perfect metaphor, but you get the gist.
At this rate, I'm going to grow up to be a sad loner like Toby Determined.
I don't know, Grunkle Stan.
This sounds kinda jerky.
Cool.
Grunkle Stan, thanks.
Hi, I'm Dipper.
Crazy place, right?
Huh.
Yeah, weird, right?
Pretend you're screaming.
Let's see about, whoa!
Huh-hoh, just kidding.
You bet I am.
I'm bad, Emma.
Kind of a jerk.
Maybe you could tell me sometime.
A girl gave me her email.
And it wasn't out of pity!
Haha!
Yes!
I'm okay.
I'm better than okay.
Mabel, hi.
There's my Grenda.
Candy, looking great, looking great.
Is that a new pair of glasses?
Very shiny.
Hahaha.
Wooo!
I can't believe it worked.
What do I do now?
Do I e-mail her?
Grunkle Stan, these tips are priceless.
Grunkle Stan, I gotta say this was one of the best days ever.
Look!
I'm just a little worried, though.
I mean is it bad to flirt with this many girls at once?
I'm just tryin'a get over Wendy.
I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings.
But wait!
That means it'll just be me and, Whoa!
Hey.
You're sitting close.
Ssssure, I mean, wasn't that already the plan?
Stan!
You gotta help me!
Everything you taught me worked too well!
I think Candy just asked me out on a date!
What?
I-I mean, Candy's great, she's sweet and she's smart, but I've never thought of her like that!
Th-th-this is all moving way too fast.
Okay.
I just need to be honest with her and tell her I-I'm not ready for all this.
But I don't wanna lead her on!
Sort of confused by the phrase New Mummies Daily, though.
I mean, how does that even work?
Uh, yep!
This is what I want!
This is all part of the plan and stuff.
Corn Maze Girl!
Nobody!
I mean, uh, somebody, but, I, I like all of you!
I mean, I don't like any of you!
I mean, I was trying to learn how to talk to girls!
Uh, Candy, wait!
Ugh, I messed everything up.
I gotta find Stan!
He'll know what to do!
Uh, have you seen an old guy around here?
Uh, big ears, orange nose, a real know-it-all?
Ughhh.
Stan, where are you?
I need your advice!
Grunkle Stan?
Yeah, you can say that again.
Where are you?
Wait, wait, wait.
Darlene's a spider person?
How is that possible?
You couldn't tell she was a spider?
Alright, I'm gonna find you.
Stay put!
Girls!
There you are.
I need your help.
Look, I'm so sorry about everything.
But Stan's in trouble!
You can totally kill me later, but right now he needs us.
I'll explain on the way.
Ugh, can't this thing go any faster?
We're all gonna die!
Candy, wait!
Don't pull that lever!
Hey.
We're both failures.
You know, even if your dating tips were bad, I actually haven't thought about Wendy all day.
Plus, you did teach me to be more confident.
I guess I just need to learn to use that power for good.
Hey.
I found a pamphlet I don't think you've read yet.
Yep!
Yep.
I deserve that.
I still feel a little bad about wrecking those tourist traps.
Oh, man.
Are we gonna have to help clean this up?
Oh, what joy.
If it isn't Mr. Upside-Downington.
How long's it been?
Third grade, maybe?
Is it the message that we're getting too old for this sort of thing?
Whoa!
Our birthday's coming up already?
Soon we're gonna be actual teenagers!
PG-13 movies, here I come!
Trigonometry?
The future!
I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously with that face on your chin.
You're, You're doing the voice so you obviously know what I'm talking about...
There is something wrong with you.
I'll just be a sec.
Great Uncle Ford, are you okay?
But your face is on fire.
What do we do?
Wait, what about Mabel?
Are you sure?
Okay, Dipper.
It's your first big mission with Ford.
A chance to prove yourself.
Don't mess this up.
Ah, heh heh, I'm alright.
Ahh!
I'm going through a bad patch, Mabel.
We'll talk when I get back.
Mabel?
Mabel, you there?
Ugh.
W-What do you mean?
Shut.
But, that's crazy!
Where did the saucer go?
You, I, words, not working for mouth.
Whoa, whoa!
I can't believe there's been a giant UFO under the town this whole time.
This is so cool!
Great Uncle Ford!
Okay.
Just turn on magnet, leap down hole.
Turn on, C'mon already.
Magnet.
A little help?
No, not really.
I mean, beyond graduating high school with a high GPA so I can get accepted to a good technical college with a photography and media production minor to start my own ghost hunting show.
Heh.
Trust me, I'd love to fast-forward the whole thing, but it's not like I have a choice.
What are you saying?
W-what about school?
There's also Mabel.
She'd be all alone in California.
Gosh, we've never really been apart before.
I-I dunno.
Sounds like a dream come true, but I'm not sure I have what it takes.
I was tricked by Bill, I was wrong about Stan's portal.
Heck, I can't even operate this magnet gun right.
I did?
Uh, Grunkle Ford, you said everything in here is dead, right?
What do we do?
Huh-wha-wha-wha- that's crazy!
Great Uncle Ford!
Wha- I-uh. I-I-uh, I can't!
Wait, no!
Great Uncle Ford!
Hang on, I'm coming for you!
Don't worry!
I'll get you out of there!
Where is that thing taking you?
No, no, no, don't worry, I'll think of something!
Hold on, Great Uncle Ford.
I'm getting you out of this, one way or another!
Oh no!
Come on, come on!
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
Let go of my uncle!
Great Uncle Ford!
Okay, let's try: magnet pulse!
Oh no!
Oh no no no no!
Come on, wake up, man!
We gotta get out of here before...
Hey, uh, I'm warning you!
I have a magnet gun!
Oh yeah!
You think you can scare me!
Do your worst!
Nothing in this universe is gonna take away my uncle!
So go ahead!
Give me what you've got!
Oh, are you alright?
What happened?
I, I did it?
Are you okay?
Let's get you out of there.
I'll do it, I'm gonna stay.
Mabel!
I just had the best day of my life!
UFOs are real and there's one under the town and I saved Great Uncle Ford's life and, and, Hey, are you okay?
Look, I was thinking and, this is a huge opportunity for me.
Look, I've been thinking about it.
I won't be gone forever, okay?
I'll still visit you at home, and we'll chat online; we'll make it work.
But it can't, Mabel.
Look, things aren't gonna stay frozen this way.
It's part of growing up.
Things change.
Summer ends.
Mabel, wait!
I didn't mean it like that!
Mabel, come back!
I don't know, maybe I'm making the wrong decision.
I need to think about this.
What?
Oh no!
The RIFT!
What's going on?
What is that?
Weirdmageddon.
Mabel!
The rift must have cracked inside her backpack.
She must be in danger.
I have to go find her.
Mabel!
Come in, Mabel!
Mabel!
Are you sure defeating Bill is even possible?
To the ends of the Earth.
Great uncle Ford!
That's enough!
Hand over my uncle!
Or else!
I, uh, I, uh...
Augh, BILL!
Ugh, THE JOURNALS!
Ahhhhh!
Huh!
Mabel, it's me.
So far I have eluded capture but I haven't been able to find you or Stan anywhere.
I don't know if you can hear me, but wherever you are, whatever happens, I'm going to find you.
The mall!
Maybe they're hiding in there!
Oh no!
Stan!
Mabel!
Huh, maybe at least I can get something to eat.
The last nachos on Earth.
HELP!
The nachos tricked me!
Wendy!
Oh no!
You've been transformed into some sort of, tree monster!
Wendy, I'm so glad to find you!
I thought everyone I knew was gone.
I was in a fight with Mabel when it happened.
Uncle Ford asked me to be his apprentice once the summer was over.
But that would mean I wouldn't go back home.
It would mean growing up without Mabel.
Mabel didn't take it well and she ran off into the forest.
She couldn't even look me in the eye.
You know, I used to think I could get out of anything, but this?
The journals are destroyed, Ford is captured and I can't find my family anywhere.
Bill said it himself, there's no room for heroes out here.
We lost.
Cause then I had Mabel.
But how will I ever find her?
The shooting star from Mabel's sweater!
She's in there.
I know it.
No, we don't have that, but we do have this thing where our allergies totally act up at the same time.
Mabel needs us.
But how are we gonna get out there without being caught?
I can't believe this place is just abandoned.
We just wanna make it to that bubble out east, we have no quarrel with you!
Fellers?
Wait, Gideon!
Ugh, it's Gideon.
Gideon, you have no right to keep her in there!
Hey!
Wendy, you're the coolest person I know.
Okay, all we have to do is outrace Gideon's henchmen, unlock the bubble, save Mabel, save the world.
Quick question: did you ever get your driver's license?
Watch it!
Go around that bubble field!
What's even in there?
For some reason, I really want worms right now.
Oh, that was horrible!
Wendy, we're almost there!
We just have to make that jump!
So, close.
Mabel, I'm, almost there.
Soos!
How'd you, where'd you...?
So what's the bad news?
Is she?
Gideon, listen to me, if I've learned anything this summer it's that you can't force someone to love you.
The best you can do is strive to be someone worthy of loving.
But Mabel doesn't.
Because you're selfish.
But you can change!
Bill thinks there's no heroes in this world, but if we work together and fight back, we can defeat him.
You wanna be Mabel's hero?
Stand up to Bill, and let us save her!
Look inside, Gideon.
If all this is for Mabel, then ask yourself what Mabel would want you to do.
Of course.
Okay, remember, guys.
This is a prison bubble designed by Bill.
We've got to prepare ourselves for what we find in here.
For Mabel.
Mabel!
Mabel!
Okay guys, Bill has taken over the town and if his weirdness spreads he's gonna take over the whole world.
Our first step to stopping him is rescuing Mabel, but he's got her trapped in this strange prison bubble.
Soos, you're choking me.
Huh?
Is the entire ground a bouncy castle?
This is Mabel's prison?
And this is worse than the apocalypse.
Do we have a choice?
Listen creepy dream guys, we're not here to party, okay?
We just need to find Mabel and get her out of here.
Where is she?
Can you guys just hold on a second?
Do you see what's happening here?
Don't forget this world was created by Bill.
That punch is probably blood!
And that glitter rain is probably ground up bones, or babies, or something.
Bill's using Mabel's own fantasies as some sick trap.
We need to grab Mabel and get the heck out of here.
This is a rescue!
Everyone hit the deck!
There she is!
Soos!
Grab her!
Wendy, barricade the door!
Don't worry, Mabel, we'll get you out of this!
Mabel!
What are you doing?
We're trying to save you from this prison!
What are you saying?
You did what?
Listen, Mabel, we're not here to party.
All of this is crazy!
You're dead to me, Soos.
Mabel, listen to yourself.
This is crazy!
I'm sorry about our fight, and I'm sorry things aren't great right now but that doesn't mean you can just stay in here forever!
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, DIPPY FRESH!
Wendy!
It's a trap!
Don't go with him, Soos!
No matter what he offers you!
Okay, this has gone too far!
You can't honestly think these fantasies are good for anyone!
Nope.
Not looking.
Not looking.
Ugh, even my stone skips are perfect!
Who am I kidding?
Maybe Mabel's right.
It's a horror show out there.
At least the air in here is breathable.
Oh, hey, Wendy, what's up?
I thought you were busy wrecking the school or whatever.
Really?
Well, now we just need a plan.
Wait, do you really mean that?
Wait, really?
Wait, aaahhh, this isn't real!
Oh my gosh.
This is crazy.
Um, I'm losing my mind.
We have to get out of here.
We have to go back. To the real. WORLD!
MABEL!
You're smarter than this!
Bill has you hypnotized or something!
Are you really gonna let them banish me?
Seriously, Mabel?
You're letting them take our argument to court?
Yes, you did!
There's a tapestry of you making the rules!
I hate him. So. Much!
Look, Mabel, this whole thing is ridiculous.
But if winning a trial is what it takes to get you to come home with us, then so be it.
Objection your honor, that's conjecture.
Photo day.
Darn allergies.
Um, well, I, um.
I don't, Look, that was one bad day!
Oh, come on, man, you can't.
Hey, what's the point of all this?
That was in the past!
Wait!
I haven't even presented my case!
Yes, I do, your honor.
I call as a witness: Mabel Pines!
Mabel, listen.
I might not have all the answers.
I'm not stylish and I'm not cool and I can't make pugs appear out of thin air.
But I know one thing well, and that's you.
And I know that although you might act like it, you don't wanna be in this fantasy world.
You're scared.
Of growing up.
And who could blame you, I'm scared, too.
Look, real life stinks sometimes, okay, I'm not gonna lie.
But there's a better way to get through it than denial, and that's with help from people who care about you.
It's how we've gotten through our whole lives.
Just look.
Mabel!
I figured out a way to fix your photo!
But, I have a razor!
We've always been there for each other.
Mabel, I thought you were living a fantasy, but look at me!
I actually thought I was gonna stay here and be Ford's apprentice!
Spend my entire teens cooped up in a basement with a labcoat?
How ridiculous is that?
I don't know what's gonna happen in the future, but whatever it is, you don't have to fear because we'll do it together.
I'm not taking Ford's apprenticeship.
We've traveled to Heck and back to get you and we're goin' back together.
Leave this fantasy world.
Let's beat Bill and grow up together.
Yes.
Definitely.
Absolutely.
Awkward sibling hug?
Soos!
Wendy!
Paradise is canceled!
Psh.
And miss out on your awkward teen years?
You wish.
Come on, guys.
Let's see if we can still go hide out in the Shack.
Yes!
It's in shambles!
Just like we left it.
Wait, what was that?
Shh.
So, what's everyone doing here?
Rumble McSkirmish?
Of course, the unicorn spell.
That's why this is the only place Bill's magic can't touch.
Grunkle Stan, we can't all just hide inside the Shack.
There's a town in need of saving.
Me and Ford tried to do it, but he got captured by Bill.
So you're really just gonna let Bill win?
Mabel is right.
Bill wants us to run and hide.
He wants us to think he's invincible.
But Ford told me before he was captured that he knows Bill's secret weakness.
Now, if we band together, if we combine all of our strength, our smarts, our, whatever Toby has, then we just might be able to rescue Ford, learn Bill's weakness, and save Gravity Falls!
Whoa!
These blueprints are incredible, McGucket.
Yeah.
Getting to actually live to see our 13th birthday party is the only birthday present I want right now.
Thanks, Soos.
Hey, has anyone seen Grunkle Stan?
Well maybe people think he's a hero because he didn't want to hide in the Mystery Shack!
Everyone!
Like we planned!
Three, two, one.
And, now!
We've got him distracted.
Now's our chance.
Okay everyone.
We get in, rescue Ford, get out, save the world.
Piece of cake.
Oh, man, oh, man, Oh, man.
It looks even worse up close.
But how are we going to unfreeze them?
How do we undo this?
Listen, Uncle Ford, we don't have a lot of time.
Remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew Bill's weakness?
Uh, we've got Bill outside, but I don't know how long we can keep him occupied.
The Tent of Telepathy sign!
That must be Gideon.
Ice?
Who's ice?
Great Uncle Ford!
I think it's working!
Join hands!
Don't do it!
Save yourselves.
Run!
We'll take care of Bill!
Trust us.
We've beat him before...
You know, I'm starting to think there's no way out of here.
Now let's round up the townsfolk and together we can defeat...
oh, no!
Oh, no.
No, Grunkle Ford!
Don't trust him!
It's your place, Grunkle Stan.
We saved the world, but what's the point?
Grunkle Stan's not himself anymore.
That time we went fishing?
That Summerween we spent together?
Don't you remember anything?
What did you say?
It's happening!
Keep going!
You know, on my first day here, if you had asked me what I wanted, I would have said, adventure, mystery, true friends.
But looking here at all of you I realize that every wish came true.
I have everything I wanted.
But not too much.
You, too.
Ready to head into the unknown?
Bye!
I'll miss you guys, too!
If you've ever taken a road trip through the Pacific Northwest, you've probably seen a bumper sticker for a place called Gravity Falls.
It's not on any maps, and most people have never heard of it.
Some people think it's a myth.
But if you're curious, don't wait.
Take a trip.
Find it.
It's out there somewhere in the woods.
Waiting.
I know the plan, buddy.
Dipper, please.
This is you you're talking about.
Plus, hey!
You can always just disintegrate with me with water.
Hey buddy it's me, you.
I just had the same jealousy fantasy.
I got the same one.
But we're gonna need some help.
Yeah, makes a good point.
Uh-oh, paper jam.
SSSHH!
Don't be rude.
Hey, buddy hey.
It's okay.
Oh, I agree.
You can't just go and DANCE with her.
What if there's a glitch in the sound system?
Robbie might come back.
There's your cue.
It's the perfect moment to ask Wendy to dance.
Good luck, me!
Hey!
What are you doing up here?
Number 10 has been distracting Soos for 15 minutes, he's gonna get tired of that dot eventually!
That's nice, but not the plan.
Do we have to remind you?
I think we all knew we were lying.
Yes you can!
Plus there's snacks and a coloring book in there for you!
Okay, now that Original Dipper or Dipper Classic is no longer fit for it, I nominate myself to dance with Wendy instead.
I've been around the longest, so it should be me.
Right?
I mean logically.
Logically, guys.
Hey, you want some cheese and crackers, buddy?
Yikes.
Hey, guys, what would you do if you were trapped in a closet?
C'mon, man.
Give it up.
You're overpowered.
Guys guys, c'mon it's me!
Say it!
Say I can dance with Wendy!
I don't know, you wanna go grab a couple sodas or something?
Some night, huh?
I don't know man, I hope so, but we're making zero progress the way we're doin' it.
The only good conversation you had with her is when you didn't do anything in that list-stuff.
Oh boy, don't look now.
It's okay dude, I had a good run.
Remember what we talked about.
Hey, and quit being such a wimp around Wendy okay?
For my sake...
