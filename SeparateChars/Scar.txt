Life's not fair, is it?
You see I...
Well, I shall never be king.
And you shall never see the light of another day.
[closed mouth laughter.]
Adieu.
[light sigh]
What do you want?
Oh now look Zazu, you made me lose my lunch.
Ohhh...
I quiver with FEAR!
Mmm-Mmm-Hmmm?
Why!
if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.
That was today?
Oh, I feel simply awful.
Must have slipped my mind.
Well, I was first in line...
until the little hairball was born.
Ohh, I shall practice my curtsy.
On, no, Mufasa.
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Temper, temper.
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share.
But, when it comes to brute strength, I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
I despise guessing games.
Oh, goody.
Yes.
Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy... bad back, you know.
A monkey's uncle.
You have no idea.
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise on the northern [sic]
border.
And he's absolutely right!
It's far too dangerous... only the bravest lions go there.
I'm sorry Simba, I just can't tell you.
Simba, Simba... I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favorite nephew.
All the more reason for me to be protective!
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince...
Oops!
Oh, dear!
I've said too much ...
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all...
Oh, just do me one favor.
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
There's a good lad.
You run along now and have fun.
And remember... it's our little secret.
Oh, surely we lions are not all -that- bad.
I see.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Charmed.
I don't think you really deserve this.
I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Precisely.
I never thought Hyenas essential.
They're crude and unspeakably plain.
But, maybe there's a glimmer of potential If allied to my vision and brain.
Just listen to teacher.
I know it sounds sordid but you'll be rewarded when at last I am given my dues.
And injustice deliciously squared: Be Prepared!
For the death of the king.
No, fool... we're going to kill him.
Simba too.
IDIOTS!
There will be a king!
I WILL BE KING!
Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected To take certain duties on board
Now you wait here.
Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it?
Hohoho...
you are such a naughty boy.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.
This is just for you and your daddy.
You know, a sort of father-son... thing.
Well.
I better go get him.
Just stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
Simba... everybody knows about that.
Oh, yes.
Lucky daddy was there to save you.
Oh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours.
Simba, it's to DIE for.
Mufasa!
Quick!
Stampede!
In the gorge.
Simba's down there!
Long live the king.
Simba... what have you done?
Of course, of course you didn't.
No one ever means for these things to happen....
But the king is dead, and if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.
What will your mother think?
Run away, Simba.
Run.
Run away, and never return.
Kill him.
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
But to lose Simba who had barely begun to live...
For me it is a deep, personal loss.
So, it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.
Yet, out of the ashes of this tragedy, we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era, [The hyenas start emerging] in which lion and hyena come together, in a great and glorious future.
Oh, Zazu... do lighten up!
Sing something with a little bounce in it.
Anything but that!
What?
What did you say?
You know the law: Never, ever mention that name in my presence.
I am the king.
Oh, what is it this time.
It's the lioness' job to do the hunting... eeeergh
Ohhh, eat Zazu.
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garnish.
What did you say?
Good.
Now get out.
Out!
SA-RA-BI!
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.
You're just not looking hard enough.
We're not going anywhere.
Then so be it.
I'm the king.
I can do whatever I want!
I'm ten times the king mufasa was!
Simba?
Simba!
I'm a little surprised to see you.
Alive.
Simba, you must understand....
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Oh-h yes.
Well.
I would, naturally, however, there is one little problem?
You see them?
They think I'm king.
Oh, must it all end in violence?
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
Wouldn't you agree Simba?
Ah, but what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Ahh, so you haven't told them your little secret.
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death!
You see!
He admits it!
Murderer!
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive.
It's your fault he's dead, do you deny it?
Then you're guilty!
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again.
But this time, daddy isn't here to save you.
And now everyone knows why!
Now this looks familiar.
Hmm-hm.
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.
Oh yes, I remember.
This is just the way your father looked before he died.
No, Simba.
Please.
Truth?
But, truth is in the eye of the behold...
I killed Mufasa!
Simba, Simba, please.
Please have mercy.
I beg you.
But, Simba, I, ah, am... family.
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.
It was their fault.
It was their idea!
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't kill your old uncle?
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.
[Aside] I'll make it up to you, I promise.
How can I prove myself to you?
Tell me.
Anything.
Anything.
Yes... of course... as you wish... your majesty!
Ahh, my friends.
Let me explain.
You don't understand.
I didn't mean for....
No, No!
Gotcha!
...Trust me.
