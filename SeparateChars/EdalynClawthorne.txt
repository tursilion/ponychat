Finally, you're back.
Now let's see what we've got here.
Garbage.
Garbage.
Garbage.
Now, this... this will make me rich.
And this... Oh, this will make good kindling.
You're not going anywhere.
You wish.
Eat you?
Why would I eat... a potential customer?
Can I offer you a human foot filled with holes?
A bar of green human candy?
Oh, oh!
How about this black shadow box that reflects only sadness?
What did you say your name was?
Well, Luz, that was pretty clever... for a human.
Oh, dear child, I'm not like you.
I'm Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles!
Would you guys quit following me around?
I haven't done squat.
Oh, all right, all right, you win.
Just let me get my stuff.
Whoops.
Can't forget this.
Follow me, human.
I won't let 'em hurt you.
A human like you is much more valuable to me alive than dead.
Whoo-hoo!
You can open your eyes now, human.
This is the Boiling Isles.
Every myth you humans have is caused by a little of our world leaking into yours.
Yep.
Griffins, vampires, giraffes.... Oh, yeah. We banished those guys. Bunch of freaks.
That happens sometimes.
Only if you help me first.
Ah, now, come along, human.
Nope.
My house has a state-of-the-art defense system.
We got no time for this, Hooty.
Let us in.
Welcome to, the Owl House... where I hide away from the pressures of modern life. Also the cops. Mm, also ex-boyfriends.
Actually, I have a roommate.
Oh, this is Luz, the human.
She's here to help us with our little... situation.
Just... let me explain.
King was once a mighty king of demons, until his Crown of Power was stolen, and he became... this.
The crown is being held by the evil Warden Wrath and locked away behind a magical force field that only a human can break through.
A human like you.
If you help us retrieve his crown, we'll send you back to your realm.
So whaddya say?
Plus, who could say no to this cute face?
I mean, we're kinda your only way home.
Nope.
Now, we've got no time to lose.
Somewhere super fun.
The Conformatorium, a place for those considered unsuitable for society.
Yep.
But we were never caught because we're too slippery.
And I'm gonna make sure the warden's distracted.
Uh... Oh, you'll fit right in.
Hang on tight.
Meet you guys at the top of the tower.
Hey, I just checked.
The warden is distracted, tormenting some tiny creature.
He won't be coming around here anytime soon.
Aw, he gets so cute when he's thirsty for power.
Come on, before he hurts himself.
We have a human, remember?
Uh, no.
Oh, look at us, Luz.
King and I don't have much in this world.
We only have each other.
So if that dumb crown is important to him, it's important to me.
And besides, us weirdos have to stick together, you know?
Well, we owe you one.
Now, let's get out of here before the warden finds us and loses his head.
Oh, I hate it when that happens.
Yeah.
This just happens when you get older.
What do you want with me?
I've never actually broken any of your stupid laws... in front of you.
All right, Warden.
You win.
I'd just like to say something first.
Come closer.
Just come a little bit closer.
Yeah, that's good.
Get over it.
You had your guards stalk me, and then you cut off my head.
I am not going out with you.
Nice!
Gun it, magic stick!
Luz... go back to the human world.
Not my boyfriend.
Luz?
Not a breakup.
Anyway, let's bounce before any more monsters fall in love with me.
Well, a deal's a deal.
Let's get you home.
Oh, and don't forget this.
What's summer camp?
What are we talking about here?
What?
All right, that's crazy.
Humans can't become witches.
Well, I could use a hand keeping this goofball out of the cupboards.
All right.
I'll teach you how to be a witch.
But you have to work for me before you learn any spells.
Deal?
Gah!
What's going on?
Hey freeloaders!
Guess what today is?
It's human treasure day!
Ahh, fresh garbage.
Yo, kid.
Your trash pile's getting cold.
While mine's getting hot!
I have never seen such an extravagant earring.
Yes I know all these things, I went there.
It was the most harrowing period of my life.
Oh, hello!
Eh, who needs her?
Wow, a surprisingly peaceful domestic moment.
When will it be ruined?
There it is.
Sorry, Luz!
These vegetables won't cook themselves... yet.
Alright, everybody in the pot!
Why do I always think that's gonna work?
Aah!
And whose fault is that?
Hah!
Yep.
Got me there.
Well, I have been researching my texts on wild magic, but I'm much too busy right now.
Hmm.
Weaponizing my pride.
Well played.
Well, in that case, this looks like a job for magic boot camp.
Nope.
You'll have no part in this.
Luz needs to focus, and I can't have her go all weird when you do something adorable.
Now, no time to waste.
You'll have to follow my teaching exactly.
We gotta go somewhere special.
A place where magic energy just flows.
A place like, the Knee!
The earliest witches came to the Knee to develop their magic, drawn to its natural power.
Though, it's not without its dangers.
Don't worry, if you don't mess with him, he won't mess with you.
Here's where we'll set up shop.
Watch out!
Well, okay, but I've got a 60/40 record of making you re-appear.
You meant... ah, never mind.
Who are they?
Only that it's for babies and Luz here clearly isn't a baby.
Nailed it.
Luz!
I should now teach you how to identify different types of snow by taste!
Go on, eat the snow.
Oooh.
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze!
You need to take me seriously.
Go taste snow without my guidance, see where it gets you.
Don't worry kid.
If you listen to me, soon you'll be doing stuff like that.
And it won't be with some wack training wand, it'll be the real deal.
But you have to trust me, okay?
We've covered snow, so now it's on to smelling moss.
Now the trick is you really gotta get it up in there.
Ah, I was wondering where that thing went.
Hey.
I know my lessons seem weird but this is what wild magic is all about!
Making a connection with nature.
The earliest witches understood that.
Human witches need to understand it too.
You wanna learn a second spell?
Then you have to learn from the island.
Now look.
And think about what the island is trying to tell you.
Hold it right there.
What are you doing with that?
Okay, so maybe my methods are... unique, but so is your magic.
Connecting to the island can help you.
That wand can't.
You've angered the Slitherbeast.
You've angered the Slitherbeast!
Watch out!
You got it!
Now finish it off!
Kid, get outta here!
I'm just gonna sneak away when the thing starts eating the twins.
Well, at least I got to see her misplaced confidence one last time.
Ugh, I hate garlic.
You want me to teach you kids something cool?
Sleep spell!
I saw.
Nice work kiddo.
Alright, your adorable banter is literally making me sick.
Let's go home already.
Ahem.
What the heck did you two get into?
Hooty!
Ah, you're a thorn in my side but you always dig your way into my heart.
Hey!
That 'sghetti is Witch's Wool.
It repels powerful spells.
Every witch worth their salt has a cloak made from this stuff.
Easy, kid!
With the Emperor's goons at my doorstep, I need this for protection.
They have really stepped up their attacks lately.
Uh, but no.
Emperor Belos wants to control all wild magic through his coven system.
He ordered my capture years ago because I refuse to fall in line.
Awww, don't sound so worried.
I'm a master escape artist.
The only thing that can slow me down is my curse, and that hasn't bothered me for weeks!
Uh oh... You know, I'm getting a little tired of this game.
So, why don't you just show me your face?
Whew!
Oh, thanks for this!
No, it's not!
You're nuts!
Ugh... you're right.
It's taking more elixir to turn me back and more magic to keep the curse from rearing its feathery head.
Jeez, you're morbid.
I just kinda sorta, turn into the Owl Beast... forever.
Ahhh, it's a fate much worse than death if you think about it.
Hey, don't worry.
I just have to limit my magic use a little.
There's the Luz I know!
Ugh.
Go on.
Do the parallel arm thing... Okay!
It's... time... for... school!
Have a good day!
Ah, what a good kid!
So considerate.
She deserves something nice.
And I think I know what!
Yeah!
Something tells me Luz is gonna like having a cape.
You thought I was knitting a cake?
Yeah, she's changed the feel of this house.
Well, she always had a good heart, but was impatient and always bit off more than she could chew.
But despite all that, I think she's finally growing up.
Luz!
Where is she?
Don't believe everything that bonehead tells you.
He doesn't want to heal me, he wants to control me!
You've always looked down on me because I'm wild, but fortunately, that just made me work harder than you.
Luz!
Stop hiding behind Luz, you coward!
Maybe it is the curse.
But then how pathetic are you, that you can't best me at my worst?
I am better than you!
Luz!
It's my power, kid.
And before you showed up, I spent my whole life wasting it.
Alright, kid.
Listen to me.
I'm going away, and I don't know if I can bounce back this time.
Watch over King.
Remember to feed Hooty.
And Luz, thank you for being in my life.
Ugh!
Please stop reading that.
Its flowery language is an insult to witches and driving away all of our serious customers!
This is a bad omen.
There must be something horrible happening today.
Absolutely not.
I never joined a coven for a reason.
Sure it's like a fun club for witches, but you're also giving up your magical independence to be part of a crooked system.
Eh, but, you know, no judgment.
In any case, I haven't been to one since we were girls.
So flowery, so awful.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I will literally do anything to stop this!
Gotta keep a low profile.
Do you think all my wanted posters are for petty theft?
But the big whammy is I disobeyed the law and refused to join a coven.
If I'm seen, I could go to jail.
Let's just get this over with.
What was that?
Uh... No, I don't.
Distraction spell!
Watch closely, Luz.
When you join a coven, all your other magic is sealed away.
From now on, that kid will only be able to make illusions.
Since I never joined a coven, I can do every kind of magic.
That's why I'm the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.
No way.
Of all the covens, they're the worst.
I'll wait out here.
Huh?
Uh-oh.
Luz, wait up!
All right, let's see this mess.
When does that elite force get here?
Huh?
You could say that.
I'm gonna head home and wash the con funk off my skin.
Oh, Lily.
I just had to see the leader of the Emperor's Coven in action.
You know, when we were kids, Lilith was so excited to see the Emperor's Coven, she peed a little.
In your dreams.
Well, I have a student.
And I bet she could wipe the floor with any of your prissy little blue bloods.
Oh, it's a promise.
Come on, kid.
Time to prepare for bloodshed.
Anyone's guess!
All right, Luz.
Let's start your training.
Now, I'm coming at you with a blast of fire.
What do you do?
Oh, that's right.
I haven't taught you many spells, huh?
Boy, I hope you didn't make an everlasting oath to stop learning magic or anything.
You'd be toast.
Ooh, boy.
Listen to me, Luz.
We are not gonna let those snobs win that easy!
We are not gonna let them win at all.
I've got an idea.
Calm down.
You see those mounds?
Get Amity to land on one of those and she'll set off my magic traps.
Nobody will know.
To all eyes up there it'll look like you're performing magic.
Just trust me.
That's the spirit!
Wait just a sec, Miss Protege.
A power glyph from the Construction Coven.
Ah-ha!
Yes, yes, yes-yes-yes!
You cheated.
Perfect, prissy Lilith cheated.
Hot dang, I love coventions!
La-la-la... Still cheated!
Welcome down to my level!
You cheated.
Hey, where's the Rhyming Coven?
What rhymes with cheated?
You were defeated, don't get heated, get your stank face treated.
Oh, it's okay, I'm done.
Because my rhymes are depleted!
There she is!
Say good night, sister.
Lily, wait.
The curse.
Look at me.
Look at my face.
The curse is worsening and I can't keep up with it.
I don't know how much time I have left.
I just had to see my sister for... possibly the last time.
It's been fun, but let's call it a draw!
We gotta go.
Let's just say she had a real snack attack.
Hah!
Wait, I got a better one.
What?
I don't know.
And who's a true witch?
These suckers?
According to them, that means being in a coven, but I never joined one and I'm better than all of them combined.
You gotta be your own witch.
Now, let's go before my sister realizes I tied her pointy shoes together.
And that's our cue!
Oh, you think that's all the mystery I got?
Wait until you hear about my parents.
Careful with those pins.
I'm chaperoning Grom tonight.
So I have to look sharp.
Ooh!
Have they announced the victim yet?
Ah, listen, kid.
That's a noble sentiment, but Grom is a little above your pay-grade.
You're a human.
You're... fragile.
There's a horrifying spider in your hair.
Facing Grom means facing your worst fear, King.
And I don't think Luz knows what that means yet.
Do you think I could pull off red eyeshadow?
Me-ow.
Still got it.
I get it.
Ditch the yellow.
Is that supposed to be me?
Dang, I look great.
Wait a sec.
You're training to be Grom queen!
You think training will help against Grom?
Luz, you always go overboard and I end up bailing you out.
Now, what's the fun in watching a kid get eaten by a monster if it's my kid?
Well, of course I'm worried!
I'm going to have to save Luz from a nightmare monster!
Ugh, so much for Mama's fun night out.
Oh, King.
Teenagers are brutal.
They'll boo anyone, and that kind of public humiliation can stick with you for life.
Spicy toss!
Hands off my human, you misshapen excuse for a monster!
That's okay, I got this one.
Huh?
WHOOOO!
Watch out for this human!
Oh, you did good, kid.
Watch closely, Luz.
Hexes Hold'em is the most tricky game on the Boiling Isles.
Any proper witch knows how to play.
Now when it looks like the deck is stacked against you, that's when you break out the wildcard.
Woo, I win!
In your adorable owl face.
Ah, I love the feeling of victory; it feels... fluffy?
What's happening again?
Oh, boy.
This is terrible.
I'm out of elixir.
I know I should be repulsed, but that look is fierce.
You're right, you're right.
We need to head to the market.
Before we go, would anyone like to play one more hand of Hexes Hold'em?
Hey, where are my cards?
Owlbert, you sore loser, gimme back my cards!
Hey, open up, Morton!
That's no parade.
Those are demon hunters.
Dangerous nomads who capture and sell the most powerful beasts.. which I'm about to become if you don't open up, Morton!
I'm all outta my juice, pal.
I've been very busy.
I am not obsessed!
Am I winning?
In the night market?
Not tonight, I'm going out.
I need you to watch the house, I have many precious objects in there.
You're coming with me.
I need an extra pair of eyes looking out for pickpockets, and an extra pair of hands in case I want to pickpocket.
Besides, conjurings are dumb... sitting in a circle holding hands.
Pft.
It's like magic for babies.
Luz, you're in charge while I'm out.
Make sure Hooty doesn't get into any trouble.
You're acting suspicious.
You're doing that thing where you hide in your hoodie.
He's right here.
His little body just conks out when he's weightless.
Look at this.
Anyway, really going now.
And Luz... if you mess up the house, I will never trust you again.
No pressure!
Bye!
I need that elixir.
You know where I can find a Grimm Hammer?
Uh, I seek the one they call Grimm Hammer.
You are Grimm Hammer?
Okay, Tibbles.
I need some of this elixir.
Huzzam!
I'll give you ten snails.
A thousand snails?
What kind of game are you playing?
Hey!
Say, you play Hexes Hold'em?
How about we make it interesting?
I win, you give me the elixir.
You win, you can take something of mine.
You card shark.
You hustled me.
I can't perform magic.
You think this can stop me?
I can still bite your ankles.
King, I'm sorry.
I know I have a problem.
I get obsessed with Hexes Hold'em.
But I'm done with that stupid game.
I promise.
Wait, what... was that my house?
Sorry, Tibbles, old boy.
It looks like you forgot about the wild card.
You are so busted.
You held a moonlight conjuring.
And you animated my house.
My house!
Well, you're all guilty, so you'll all be punished by cleaning my house top to bottom.
And another thing... that was totally amazing.
And I'm so joining you for next year's conjuring.
Now get to work.
Yeah.
You're right.
That takes some powerful magic.
Well, Luz!
Did you ever in your life think you'd see something as breathtaking as this?
Yes, it doesn't get much more inspiring than the trash slug.
It makes a home, a life from what others have thrown by the wayside.
Until, blam, it gets blasted by a wave one day and croaks from all the salt.
And then we get to sell the stuff it ate.
Ah, nuts to you both.
Ugh.
That sounds like a bunch of magic school stuff.
What's worse, they force you to learn magic the proper way.
But magic isn't proper.
It's wild and unpredictable.
And that's why it's so beautiful.
I didn't finish school, and look at me!
Who wouldn't envy where I am right now?
Uh... Hey, here's a lesson.
A great witch is resourceful like this.
Use your slime ball wisely, young witch.
Back at it!
We'll hit the stink nodes first.
More for me, then.
There we go.
Okay.
This is awesome!
Not a bad haul.
That oviduct was loaded.
I didn't lose anything.
And what would you teach?
How to get stuck in the arm of a sweater?
After they tear you out of the sweater arm, right?
Okay.
I'm obligated to remind you that I only use our bets to utterly humiliate you.
And... that you've never won.
So how's this?
Teach this trash slug to be your loyal soldier in one day.
Prove that you can be a better teacher than me, and Luz is all yours.
But if you don't, I change your name from King to... Wiggles.
Deal.
Ha ha!
Hey, Mr Wiggles.
You're not gonna teach it anything doing that.
Oh, no.
Please stop.
Ha-ha-ha, you wish.
But yeah.
Where is she?
Have you seen Luz?
Are you trying to point, or...?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Blind obedience.
Pointless busywork!
Why!
School!
Yes, great, you won.
You have a giant soldier thing and I have nothing.
Congrats!
Ugh.
Trouble with your student?
Are you sure you need my help?
Maybe he only wants more of your brilliant lessons.
Okay, Mr Wiggles.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Pour the salt, now!
I wish Luz thought that too.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What is this?
Ugh!
I never understand when you do this.
Seriously, what is that?
That's my girl!
Yeah, that's right.
Luz is my student.
Back off, academy twerps.
Ah, baby's first wanted poster.
Good job, kid.
Looks like I taught you something after all.
Probably an offering.
Being the most powerful witch in the Boiling Isles has its perks.
Witches eating babies is so 1693.
What is this?
Nope.
Babies are awful.
Not happening.
She's the wealthiest demon on the Boiling Isles.
Get in with her and you're set for life.
So, we keep this thing alive for a few hours and we get paid.
You have to return the books I checked out from the library.
I don't want her getting a cut of the loot.
Now, let's take a look at this little darling.
Argh!
On second thought maybe we could use your help!
We got this, right?
Whoa!
Ugh.
I hate it too, pip-squeak.
But think about the money.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.
Say that again and I steal your tongue.
For the money.
That's insane.
Aah, there's only one way out of this.
Apple slices and story time.
All right, brats.
Let's do this.
Ugh.
Being parental is making me sick.
Otabin spend his days alone amongst the many books he'd sewn.
Where are the babies?
And I just taught Junior how to pick locks too.
We did it all for the money.
Thanks, kid.
So, how was your night?
I smell an easy mark.
Hey, kid!
Can I offer you the latest fashions from... the human realm?
Well, I hate her.
Luz!
Stop that.
You may be forgetting something, Luz.
I'm kinda... on the run!
Every guard in town would be at my doorstep if I had my name in lights.
You're pampered all day like a dang baby.
How hard is that life?
Well, there's only one thing to do when friends can't see eye to eye.
Pfft, no.
Body swap!
I love a good body swap.
It's like demonic possession with the ones you love.
Body swap!
How do I look?
All right, here's the deal.
Whoever can prove their new body has the easiest life gets out of house cleaning duty.
And you know what that means.
That's cute.
If you need me, I'll be getting pampered on a vacation fit for a king.
Oh, hello.
Yes, hello to you too, handsome.
An emperor's guard.
Wait, you know who I am?
That's more like it.
You got nothing!
Being King is a walk in the park.
I'm gonna win this bet for sure.
What's that?
Whoa!
Hey, I'm not lost, you creeps!
Ooh.
You know what?
Maybe I am lost.
Take me away, ladies.
Ugh...
What hot mess is going down here?
Well, my creep alarm is ringing, but I can't argue with num-nums.
Oh, being adorable is the life.
Time for a nap.
You hear that, Bowtie?
There's a new star in town.
Okay, I'm out.
Novelty costumes are where I draw the line.
Ladies, stand back.
I am not above disrespecting my elders.
Oh, dang.
I'm not a witch right now.
Not today, sister!
Stop babying me!
This vacation just took an alarming, back-alley turn.
Geez, I thought I liked being babied.
But I feel so small and helpless, like some sort of... baby.
But that won't happen to us, right?
I failed you, Bowtie.
My closest ally.
I'll avenge you, Bowtie!
Ooh!
Huh?
You can have it.
Your life is pretty terrible.
But, hey, it'll probably be over soon.
Luz!
Bring my dang body over here.
I got the same question.
All right.
Did everybody learn a valuable lesson about experiencing each other's hardships?
Good, let's end this nightmare.
Body swap!
Thanks, Luz.
Don't worry, I got this.
Body swap!
Aw, that's sweet, kid.
Now, let's never speak of this again.
Please, no.
Not the comedy hour...
It just goes on like this for an hour!
Yes, she'll be back; she always comes back.
It's cute you miss her, though.
Junk, junk, death hex.
Oh, a carnival's in town today!
Carnivals bring crowds and crowds bring suckers.
This could be the perfect chance to try out my new get-witch-quick scheme.
I'm in!
Well, here we are, kids.
Look at all that fresh meat.
No games for you, Owlbert, we've got scams to run.
Tibbles?
You sent this?
I don't buy it.
What kind of con are you running?
Oh yeah, sure!
I know poison when I see it... you can't scam a scammer!
Beat it loser!
Step right up to... Eda's Human Horror House!
Humans shed their skin and I've got proof.
Round as the moon, her ears are, with mood swings as terrifying as night itself.
Now, who wants to touch an outdated human reference?
Ah, what are you?
The fun police?
Uh, excuse me, sir.
I'd like to have a word with your staff.
Owlbert!
Owlbert!
Where are you?
Owlbert, you're lucky I can't be mad at your adorable antics.
I hate carnivals.
Just when I thought I couldn't respect the law any less... it surprises me.
Spare me the yuks.
What do you want?
Caramel Crab Apples.
Get 'em hot and pinchy.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold your spider-horses.
Hey, hey.
No discounts, buddy.
Dumb kids?
Wait.
Those are my dumb kids!
Oh, no, Tibbles.
That's not how entertainment works.
The bad guy always gets his just desserts.
Hey, girls.
This one's on the house.
Nah.
I think I got everything I wanted.
Yep.
Another great year at the carnival.
But nothing.
Bump did you a favor.
There ain't nothing for you at that dweebus factory.
No offense, dweebus.
Oh, you think you're clever, huh?
Can it, King!
First off, it's the Bad Girl Coven and second off, I guess you don't want in on the T-shirt order, huh?
I mean, yeah, well, I don't wanna hear another word about Hexside, unless it's Hexside is on fire and let's grab front row seats!
I'm trying to protect her.
Hexside chews up anything unique and spits out bland mush.
But that's my beef.
Does she need to draw her own conclusions?
You're just gonna be unhelpful, huh?
I gotta get that girl into school.
Ugh.
I had this nightmare before.
Been quite a while since I've sat here, huh?
I gotta admit it's extra weird without you yelling at me for picking fights or stealing.
I want to enroll my human, Luz, at Hexside.
You no-good... Wait, really?
Oh right.
Yeah.
I heard all about that abomination incident.
Huh.
I thought there'd be more.
I don't wanna do this!
Meh!
The girls' changing room is ghost-free.
They're just as bad as Luz.
She'd love it here.
All right.
What's next, Bumpikins?
I washed off all the graffiti.
Apologized to Jenkinmeyer for stealing her teeth.
Caught all the wild cerebi.
Ah, we should be good.
And you won't tell the Emperor's Coven about this, will you?
Guess who got you into Hexside!
Ugh, kid.
Come on, kid.
Let's go.
Huh.
Dang, dweebus.
Uh, hold on.
Hold on.
I'm only doing this because I have faith in you.
And I know you're too smart to fall for that One-Witch, One-Coven nonsense.
You can learn a lot from the witches here.
And maybe teach them some of that Bad Girl Coven magic too.
Wait!
I gotta do more stuff?
Ugh!
You better enjoy this place, kid.
Nah kid, you got this, just do what we practiced!
Hey.
Calm down, calm down.
I had to do the same thing when I was a witchling.
It's like a rite of passage.
Granted, I was a little more skilled.
Right, right.
Sorry, sorry.
Now, get pumped.
Get ready.
Now, go!
Improvise.
Right, you gotta calm down.
What are you nervous about?
You've been to school before.
Hey, don't worry about what those dorks think.
If you want my advice, walk into class and punch the first kid you see.
To establish dominance.
Last chance to back out, and earn a new Bad Girl Coven patch.
Quitting. It's like trying, but easier.
Hold up!
Just try not to be too much of a goody Luz shoes.
You got this.
Whoops!
A gust of wind just got me.
See you after school!
Byeeee!
Boiling rain!
Everybody inside now!
Phew!
That was close.
But the important thing is you didn't get hurt.
Yeah, we don't have weather.
We have plagues, gorenados, shale hail, painbows.
So, until the boiling rain stops, no one is allowed outside tonight.
Well, whatever the case, this force field spell should protect the house from boiling rains and made-up demons.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
'Cause I'm so wise.
No, I don't.
It sparkles and shimmers.
It shines and delights.
I must have it for my nest...
Ugh.
That force field really took it out of me.
Ahh!
Whatever it is, no.
I'm not teaching you magic tonight.
I'm sleepy.
I'm a sleepy little owl.
Ooh!
I respect your cunning, but I also hate you for it.
If you want a witch's staff like mine, don't make me repeat myself.
Witch's staffs have power embedded into them.
But before one is earned, every witch needs to know how to cast spells on their own.
Now tonight I will show you how to create light.
Now, humans think magic is made out of thin air, but that's stupid.
Everything comes from something.
Let me ask you, kid.
Where do you think magic comes from?
Actually, you're right.
No, really.
It comes from a sac of magic bile attached to a witch's heart.
Now, everything depends on the spell circle.
The bigger the circle, the more powerful the spell.
You know, I'm not actually sure.
I know witches did magic differently in the past, but I never bothered to figure out how.
Don't worry.
You'll figure it out.
Now I need to lie down.
Fine.
Ooh, boy.
Ahh!
W-What happened?
Oh, I have the worst headache.
And my mouth tastes like roadkill.
Hmm?
I was looking for that.
King?
King!
You stole my elixir?
Wow.
How is she doing that?
Well, you better be.
I got a long list of disgusting chores with your name on it.
But it's not entirely your fault.
I haven't been completely honest with you guys.
When I was younger, I was cursed.
Well, that's why people call me the Owl Lady.
No one likes having a curse, but if you take the right steps, it's manageable.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
It's all under control, and as long as no one steals my elixir then I'm fine.
But, hey, look at this.
A human doing magic.
Good on you, kid.
No, not this memory again.
You're the one who cursed me, aren't you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
So, you set Willow's memories on fire and erased everything.
Even minor damage can have huge effects!
Yep, her brain's burned up real good.
Damage like that can change everything about a person.
Willow may never be the same.
Nap time.
I didn't cast it on you.
There is one way, but it's terribly dangerous and partially illegal.
So you're in the right place!
I'll send you into her mind to fix the damage.
It won't be easy.
You have a lot to fix in there, 'cause it's a mess!
Yep, whoever did this to Willow showed unbelievable disregard for her safety, downright despicable.
Oh right, it was you.
Anyways, Luz, who's going inside with you?
This is someone's brain, not a night club!
Alright!
Bold choice, taking the girl who caused the mess.
When you're done, ring that and I'll cast you back... 
Oh, and keep an eye out for her Inner Willow.
She's the gatekeeper of emotions and memory.
She might help ya.
Now, here we go!
Ahem.
If you need an interview, look no further.
Interesting?
I'm a bad girl living in a secret fortress.
Shh!
I'm public enemy number one.
I'm the greatest witch who ever lived!
Just give up, King, 'cause I got this.
Wha?
The kid scares me.
How's that for interesting?
There's levels to me kid, levels I say!
Who got the gig, kid?
Hooty?
Ooooh, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna bake that bird in a pie!
Huh?
Oh, right, I put people in there.
He's fine, he's just dead to us.
Ah, Grudgby season is the best.
You know, I used to play, back in my gory days.
Well, that too.
I was unstoppable on the field.
I had the best moves and the best cheats.
Ugh.
What do humans know, with your goody-goody attitude?
If cheaters never prosper, why was I the star player?
All this talk of Grudgby has me feeling nostalgic.
Whaddya say you and me take a little trip down memory lane?
That’s the spirit.
Ugh.
Come on!
And here’s when we took down Epiderm High in the semi-finals.
Oh, I was the youngest on the team, but I had what some call star power.
This is my cheat box.
I have all my best weapons in here.
Oh, I never lost a game with this bad boy.
Lilith.
Ugh.
Scram, Hooty.
No reason.
It’s laundry day.
What are you doing here?
You were saying?
Ooh, Aah.
What an incredible opportunity for me.
Pah!
Never.
I was just telling King here how good I was.
Ah, tell you what.
I’ll go with you peacefully to the Emperor... Sure. If you beat me at a game of Grudgby.
Luz is always challenging people to things.
Why not me?
Yeah, intimidation armor.
Pushing paper all day might make you a little rusty.
I’ll try to go easy on you.
Hooty!
Whose side are you on?
Just one little trick and the game will be mine.
Dang it, Luz!
Your nonsense has gotten into my head.
Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way.
Not today, sister.
Yeah!
Yes!
Still got it!
Still got the skills to pay the bills!
Here.
Tell them I put up a heck of a struggle.
I’ll be waiting.
Of course not.
Keep cheering.
Welcome to... the Owl House.
Hmm?
Ugh!
Who are you, again?
Kid, lay off the details.
I haven't even had my cup of apple blood yet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, kid.
Being a witch doesn't happen overnight.
Also, you're wrapped in a bathrobe and wearing the dirtiest traffic cone I've ever seen.
But a magic staff, huh?
You really want one?
Magic staff, come to me!
It's early.
Now, witches are awarded their staffs from school.
With me as your teacher, you'll be taking a different approach.
You'll have to work for it.
I run a few businesses.
On weekends, I offer rare human treasures that Owlbert drags over from your side of the realm.
But most days I sell only the finest homemade elixirs and potions.
No one wants an un-oiled snake.
Follow me.
Today you'll deliver packages and sell potions to that town over there, Bonesborough.
You'll have to be careful.
I have rivals everywhere who'd love to take my business down and you along with it.
You wanted a dangerous magical quest?
Sister, you've got one.
I'm sure.
Remember, never befriend a man in sandals and always measure twice, cut once.
Good luck!
I hate to interrupt your power nap, but you have to go with her.
You and I know she's either going to get lost or eaten, probably both.
And because you work for me, too, unless you want to start paying rent.
Be back by nightfall or risk mortal peril.
Oh, you guys talking about bad girls?
Wait, what's going on?
Ugh!
Wizards are the worst.
Never trust a man in casual drapery.
Why?
Wait, wait, Luz?
Let me see this map.
You didn't think this was real, did you?
This map is bunk.
There's no lake with a Celestial Staff on the Boiling Isles.
I would have stolen it ages ago.
Ah, don't worry.
Couple more months here and you won't look like such a mark.
Crony, wake up.
You said that wizard was one of my clients?
I don't know him that well.
And I don't trust this itch he's scratching in the human.
Hey, Luz?
Aw, nuts.
Hooty, where'd she go?
Ugh!
I don't like this.
I really don't like this.
Oh, no.
Are you sure she came here?
Hmm.
Hey!
Wake up, you.
What have you done with Luz?
What's your endgame?
It's a trap.
They want me to follow Luz.
Hmm.
I know this guy.
He's no wizard.
He's what you'd call a puppeteer, a demon who specializes in scamming and manipulating people.
He's trying to use Luz to get to me.
Well, if you can think of a better plan, I'd love to hear it.
Hey, faster, you.
That's right.
You have me.
Now release Luz.
Luz!
Well, that's the last time I take an outside referral.
Mmm.
Oh, did you want some of that?
Thinking of calling it quits, huh?
Hmm.
Maybe not here.
But come with me.
I got something to show you.
Okay, you can look.
The bones of the Isles.
Up close, the Isles can be slimy and gross.
But if you look at it from a different perspective...
Look, kid, everyone wants to believe they're chosen.
But if we all waited around for a prophecy to make us special, we'd die waiting.
And that's why you need to choose yourself.
Not yet.
But... someday.
That's a no.
It'll take some time to get used to this.
Thanks, kid.
I look forward to that.
Where am I?
What is this?
Aw farts, I got caught.
You stay away from her, or so help me, Titan....
Tough, 'cause I ain't telling you nothing!
Wait!
Don't touch her!
Lilith, don't let him hurt her!
Lilith!
Luz?
Oh no, oh no no no no no... what are you doing here?
Your magic isn't strong enough for this.
You need to leave!
Now.
Listen to me.
I'm here because of my own actions.
I went against Belos's law, and for a while I was able to get away with it.
But, well without magic, I can't do much.
I don't regret anything.
I lived freely and... I got to meet you.
But if you stay here, I won't be able to protect you.
You need to leave.
Now!
You have a family already.
Go back to them.
And when you're home, use your fire magic to destroy the portal door.
I don't know why Belos wants it, but we can't take any chances.
I love you too, kiddo.
Luz, get away!
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Luz.
Lilith.
You hurt Luz.
You cursed me.
Before anything turns me to stone, I'll tear you apart.
What?
As good as I'll ever be.
Let's fly.
