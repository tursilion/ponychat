Finally, you're back.
Now let's see what we've got here.
Garbage.
Garbage.
Garbage.
Now, this... this will make me rich.
And this... Oh, this will make good kindling.
You're not going anywhere.
You wish.
Eat you?
Why would I eat... a potential customer?
Can I offer you a human foot filled with holes?
A bar of green human candy?
Oh, oh!
How about this black shadow box that reflects only sadness?
What did you say your name was?
Well, Luz, that was pretty clever... for a human.
Oh, dear child, I'm not like you.
I'm Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles!
Would you guys quit following me around?
I haven't done squat.
Oh, all right, all right, you win.
Just let me get my stuff.
Whoops.
Can't forget this.
Follow me, human.
I won't let 'em hurt you.
A human like you is much more valuable to me alive than dead.
Whoo-hoo!
You can open your eyes now, human.
This is the Boiling Isles.
Every myth you humans have is caused by a little of our world leaking into yours.
Yep.
Griffins, vampires, giraffes... 
Oh, yeah. 
We banished those guys. 
Bunch of freaks.
That happens sometimes.
Only if you help me first.
Ah, now, come along, human.
Nope.
My house has a state-of-the-art defense system.
We got no time for this, Hooty.
Let us in.
Welcome to, the Owl House... where I hide away from the pressures of modern life. Also the cops. Mm, also ex-boyfriends.
Actually, I have a roommate.
Oh, this is Luz, the human.
She's here to help us with our little... situation.
Just... let me explain.
King was once a mighty king of demons, until his Crown of Power was stolen, and he became... this.
The crown is being held by the evil Warden Wrath and locked away behind a magical force field that only a human can break through.
A human like you.
If you help us retrieve his crown, we'll send you back to your realm.
So whaddya say?
Plus, who could say no to this cute face?
I mean, we're kinda your only way home.
Nope.
Now, we've got no time to lose.
Somewhere super fun.
The Conformatorium, a place for those considered unsuitable for society.
Yep.
But we were never caught because we're too slippery.
And I'm gonna make sure the warden's distracted.
Uh... Oh, you'll fit right in.
Hang on tight.
Meet you guys at the top of the tower.
Hey, I just checked.
The warden is distracted, tormenting some tiny creature.
He won't be coming around here anytime soon.
Aw, he gets so cute when he's thirsty for power.
Come on, before he hurts himself.
We have a human, remember?
Uh, no.
Oh, look at us, Luz.
King and I don't have much in this world.
We only have each other.
So if that dumb crown is important to him, it's important to me.
And besides, us weirdos have to stick together, you know?
Well, we owe you one.
Now, let's get out of here before the warden finds us and loses his head.
Oh, I hate it when that happens.
Yeah.
This just happens when you get older.
What do you want with me?
I've never actually broken any of your stupid laws... in front of you.
All right, Warden.
You win.
I'd just like to say something first.
Come closer.
Just come a little bit closer.
Yeah, that's good.
Get over it.
You had your guards stalk me, and then you cut off my head.
I am not going out with you.
Nice!
Gun it, magic stick!
Luz... go back to the human world.
Not my boyfriend.
Luz?
Not a breakup.
Anyway, let's bounce before any more monsters fall in love with me.
Well, a deal's a deal.
Let's get you home.
Oh, and don't forget this.
What's summer camp?
What are we talking about here?
What?
All right, that's crazy.
Humans can't become witches.
Well, I could use a hand keeping this goofball out of the cupboards.
All right.
I'll teach you how to be a witch.
But you have to work for me before you learn any spells.
Deal?
Gah!
What's going on?
Hey freeloaders!
Guess what today is?
It's human treasure day!
Ahh, fresh garbage.
Yo, kid.
Your trash pile's getting cold.
While mine's getting hot!
I have never seen such an extravagant earring.
Yes I know all these things, I went there.
It was the most harrowing period of my life.
Oh, hello!
Eh, who needs her?
Wow, a surprisingly peaceful domestic moment.
When will it be ruined?
There it is.
Sorry, Luz!
These vegetables won't cook themselves... yet.
Alright, everybody in the pot!
Why do I always think that's gonna work?
Aah!
And whose fault is that?
Hah!
Yep.
Got me there.
Well, I have been researching my texts on wild magic, but I'm much too busy right now.
Hmm.
Weaponizing my pride.
Well played.
Well, in that case, this looks like a job for magic boot camp.
Nope.
You'll have no part in this.
Luz needs to focus, and I can't have her go all weird when you do something adorable.
Now, no time to waste.
You'll have to follow my teaching exactly.
We gotta go somewhere special.
A place where magic energy just flows.
A place like, the Knee!
The earliest witches came to the Knee to develop their magic, drawn to its natural power.
Though, it's not without its dangers.
Don't worry, if you don't mess with him, he won't mess with you.
Here's where we'll set up shop.
Watch out!
Well, okay, but I've got a 60/40 record of making you re-appear.
You meant... ah, never mind.
Who are they?
Only that it's for babies and Luz here clearly isn't a baby.
Nailed it.
Luz!
I should now teach you how to identify different types of snow by taste!
Go on, eat the snow.
Oooh.
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze!
You need to take me seriously.
Go taste snow without my guidance, see where it gets you.
Don't worry kid.
If you listen to me, soon you'll be doing stuff like that.
And it won't be with some wack training wand, it'll be the real deal.
But you have to trust me, okay?
We've covered snow, so now it's on to smelling moss.
Now the trick is you really gotta get it up in there.
Ah, I was wondering where that thing went.
Hey.
I know my lessons seem weird but this is what wild magic is all about!
Making a connection with nature.
The earliest witches understood that.
Human witches need to understand it too.
You wanna learn a second spell?
Then you have to learn from the island.
Now look.
And think about what the island is trying to tell you.
Hold it right there.
What are you doing with that?
Okay, so maybe my methods are... unique, but so is your magic.
Connecting to the island can help you.
That wand can't.
You've angered the Slitherbeast.
You've angered the Slitherbeast!
Watch out!
You got it!
Now finish it off!
Kid, get outta here!
I'm just gonna sneak away when the thing starts eating the twins.
Well, at least I got to see her misplaced confidence one last time.
Ugh, I hate garlic.
You want me to teach you kids something cool?
Sleep spell!
I saw.
Nice work kiddo.
Alright, your adorable banter is literally making me sick.
Let's go home already.
Ahem.
What the heck did you two get into?
Hooty!
Ah, you're a thorn in my side but you always dig your way into my heart.
Hey!
That 'sghetti is Witch's Wool.
It repels powerful spells.
Every witch worth their salt has a cloak made from this stuff.
Easy, kid!
With the Emperor's goons at my doorstep, I need this for protection.
They have really stepped up their attacks lately.
Uh, but no.
Emperor Belos wants to control all wild magic through his coven system.
He ordered my capture years ago because I refuse to fall in line.
Awww, don't sound so worried.
I'm a master escape artist.
The only thing that can slow me down is my curse, and that hasn't bothered me for weeks!
Uh oh... You know, I'm getting a little tired of this game.
So, why don't you just show me your face?
Whew!
Oh, thanks for this!
No, it's not!
You're nuts!
Ugh... you're right.
It's taking more elixir to turn me back and more magic to keep the curse from rearing its feathery head.
Jeez, you're morbid.
I just kinda sorta, turn into the Owl Beast... forever.
Ahhh, it's a fate much worse than death if you think about it.
Hey, don't worry.
I just have to limit my magic use a little.
There's the Luz I know!
Ugh.
Go on.
Do the parallel arm thing... Okay!
It's... time... for... school!
Have a good day!
Ah, what a good kid!
So considerate.
She deserves something nice.
And I think I know what!
Yeah!
Something tells me Luz is gonna like having a cape.
You thought I was knitting a cake?
Yeah, she's changed the feel of this house.
Well, she always had a good heart, but was impatient and always bit off more than she could chew.
But despite all that, I think she's finally growing up.
Luz!
Where is she?
Don't believe everything that bonehead tells you.
He doesn't want to heal me, he wants to control me!
You've always looked down on me because I'm wild, but fortunately, that just made me work harder than you.
Luz!
Stop hiding behind Luz, you coward!
Maybe it is the curse.
But then how pathetic are you, that you can't best me at my worst?
I am better than you!
Luz!
It's my power, kid.
And before you showed up, I spent my whole life wasting it.
Alright, kid.
Listen to me.
I'm going away, and I don't know if I can bounce back this time.
Watch over King.
Remember to feed Hooty.
And Luz, thank you for being in my life.
Ugh!
Please stop reading that.
Its flowery language is an insult to witches and driving away all of our serious customers!
This is a bad omen.
There must be something horrible happening today.
Absolutely not.
I never joined a coven for a reason.
Sure it's like a fun club for witches, but you're also giving up your magical independence to be part of a crooked system.
Eh, but, you know, no judgment.
In any case, I haven't been to one since we were girls.
So flowery, so awful.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I will literally do anything to stop this!
Gotta keep a low profile.
Do you think all my wanted posters are for petty theft?
But the big whammy is I disobeyed the law and refused to join a coven.
If I'm seen, I could go to jail.
Let's just get this over with.
What was that?
Uh... No, I don't.
Distraction spell!
Watch closely, Luz.
When you join a coven, all your other magic is sealed away.
From now on, that kid will only be able to make illusions.
Since I never joined a coven, I can do every kind of magic.
That's why I'm the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.
No way.
Of all the covens, they're the worst.
I'll wait out here.
Huh?
Uh-oh.
Luz, wait up!
All right, let's see this mess.
When does that elite force get here?
Huh?
You could say that.
I'm gonna head home and wash the con funk off my skin.
Oh, Lily.
I just had to see the leader of the Emperor's Coven in action.
You know, when we were kids, Lilith was so excited to see the Emperor's Coven, she peed a little.
In your dreams.
Well, I have a student.
And I bet she could wipe the floor with any of your prissy little blue bloods.
Oh, it's a promise.
Come on, kid.
Time to prepare for bloodshed.
Anyone's guess!
All right, Luz.
Let's start your training.
Now, I'm coming at you with a blast of fire.
What do you do?
Oh, that's right.
I haven't taught you many spells, huh?
Boy, I hope you didn't make an everlasting oath to stop learning magic or anything.
You'd be toast.
Ooh, boy.
Listen to me, Luz.
We are not gonna let those snobs win that easy!
We are not gonna let them win at all.
I've got an idea.
Calm down.
You see those mounds?
Get Amity to land on one of those and she'll set off my magic traps.
Nobody will know.
To all eyes up there it'll look like you're performing magic.
Just trust me.
That's the spirit!
Wait just a sec, Miss Protege.
A power glyph from the Construction Coven.
Ah-ha!
Yes, yes, yes-yes-yes!
You cheated.
Perfect, prissy Lilith cheated.
Hot dang, I love coventions!
La-la-la... Still cheated!
Welcome down to my level!
You cheated.
Hey, where's the Rhyming Coven?
What rhymes with cheated?
You were defeated, don't get heated, get your stank face treated.
Oh, it's okay, I'm done.
Because my rhymes are depleted!
There she is!
Say good night, sister.
Lily, wait.
The curse.
Look at me.
Look at my face.
The curse is worsening and I can't keep up with it.
I don't know how much time I have left.
I just had to see my sister for... possibly the last time.
It's been fun, but let's call it a draw!
We gotta go.
Let's just say she had a real snack attack.
Hah!
Wait, I got a better one.
What?
I don't know.
And who's a true witch?
These suckers?
According to them, that means being in a coven, but I never joined one and I'm better than all of them combined.
You gotta be your own witch.
Now, let's go before my sister realizes I tied her pointy shoes together.
And that's our cue!
Oh, you think that's all the mystery I got?
Wait until you hear about my parents.
Careful with those pins.
I'm chaperoning Grom tonight.
So I have to look sharp.
Ooh!
Have they announced the victim yet?
Ah, listen, kid.
That's a noble sentiment, but Grom is a little above your pay-grade.
You're a human.
You're... fragile.
There's a horrifying spider in your hair.
Facing Grom means facing your worst fear, King.
And I don't think Luz knows what that means yet.
Do you think I could pull off red eyeshadow?
Me-ow.
Still got it.
I get it.
Ditch the yellow.
Is that supposed to be me?
Dang, I look great.
Wait a sec.
You're training to be Grom queen!
You think training will help against Grom?
Luz, you always go overboard and I end up bailing you out.
Now, what's the fun in watching a kid get eaten by a monster if it's my kid?
Well, of course I'm worried!
I'm going to have to save Luz from a nightmare monster!
Ugh, so much for Mama's fun night out.
Oh, King.
Teenagers are brutal.
They'll boo anyone, and that kind of public humiliation can stick with you for life.
Spicy toss!
Hands off my human, you misshapen excuse for a monster!
That's okay, I got this one.
Huh?
WHOOOO!
Watch out for this human!
Oh, you did good, kid.
Watch closely, Luz.
Hexes Hold'em is the most tricky game on the Boiling Isles.
Any proper witch knows how to play.
Now when it looks like the deck is stacked against you, that's when you break out the wildcard.
Woo, I win!
In your adorable owl face.
Ah, I love the feeling of victory... it feels... fluffy?
What's happening again?
Oh, boy.
This is terrible.
I'm out of elixir.
I know I should be repulsed, but that look is fierce.
You're right, you're right.
We need to head to the market.
Before we go, would anyone like to play one more hand of Hexes Hold'em?
Hey, where are my cards?
Owlbert, you sore loser, gimme back my cards!
Hey, open up, Morton!
That's no parade.
Those are demon hunters.
Dangerous nomads who capture and sell the most powerful beasts.. which I'm about to become if you don't open up, Morton!
I'm all outta my juice, pal.
I've been very busy.
I am not obsessed!
Am I winning?
In the night market?
Not tonight, I'm going out.
I need you to watch the house, I have many precious objects in there.
You're coming with me.
I need an extra pair of eyes looking out for pickpockets, and an extra pair of hands in case I want to pickpocket.
Besides, conjurings are dumb... sitting in a circle holding hands.
Pft.
It's like magic for babies.
Luz, you're in charge while I'm out.
Make sure Hooty doesn't get into any trouble.
You're acting suspicious.
You're doing that thing where you hide in your hoodie.
He's right here.
His little body just conks out when he's weightless.
Look at this.
Anyway, really going now.
And Luz... if you mess up the house, I will never trust you again.
No pressure!
Bye!
I need that elixir.
You know where I can find a Grimm Hammer?
Uh, I seek the one they call Grimm Hammer.
You are Grimm Hammer?
Okay, Tibbles.
I need some of this elixir.
Huzzam!
I'll give you ten snails.
A thousand snails?
What kind of game are you playing?
Hey!
Say, you play Hexes Hold'em?
How about we make it interesting?
I win, you give me the elixir.
You win, you can take something of mine.
You card shark.
You hustled me.
I can't perform magic.
You think this can stop me?
I can still bite your ankles.
King, I'm sorry.
I know I have a problem.
I get obsessed with Hexes Hold'em.
But I'm done with that stupid game.
I promise.
Wait, what... was that my house?
Sorry, Tibbles, old boy.
It looks like you forgot about the wild card.
You are so busted.
You held a moonlight conjuring.
And you animated my house.
My house!
Well, you're all guilty, so you'll all be punished by cleaning my house top to bottom.
And another thing... that was totally amazing.
And I'm so joining you for next year's conjuring.
Now get to work.
Yeah.
You're right.
That takes some powerful magic.
Well, Luz!
Did you ever in your life think you'd see something as breathtaking as this?
Yes, it doesn't get much more inspiring than the trash slug.
It makes a home, a life from what others have thrown by the wayside.
Until, blam, it gets blasted by a wave one day and croaks from all the salt.
And then we get to sell the stuff it ate.
Ah, nuts to you both.
Ugh.
That sounds like a bunch of magic school stuff.
What's worse, they force you to learn magic the proper way.
But magic isn't proper.
It's wild and unpredictable.
And that's why it's so beautiful.
I didn't finish school, and look at me!
Who wouldn't envy where I am right now?
Uh... Hey, here's a lesson.
A great witch is resourceful like this.
Use your slime ball wisely, young witch.
Back at it!
We'll hit the stink nodes first.
More for me, then.
There we go.
Okay.
This is awesome!
Not a bad haul.
That oviduct was loaded.
I didn't lose anything.
And what would you teach?
How to get stuck in the arm of a sweater?
After they tear you out of the sweater arm, right?
Okay.
I'm obligated to remind you that I only use our bets to utterly humiliate you.
And... that you've never won.
So how's this?
Teach this trash slug to be your loyal soldier in one day.
Prove that you can be a better teacher than me, and Luz is all yours.
But if you don't, I change your name from King to... Wiggles.
Deal.
Ha ha!
Hey, Mr Wiggles.
You're not gonna teach it anything doing that.
Oh, no.
Please stop.
Ha-ha-ha, you wish.
But yeah.
Where is she?
Have you seen Luz?
Are you trying to point, or...?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Blind obedience.
Pointless busywork!
Why!
School!
Yes, great, you won.
You have a giant soldier thing and I have nothing.
Congrats!
Ugh.
Trouble with your student?
Are you sure you need my help?
Maybe he only wants more of your brilliant lessons.
Okay, Mr Wiggles.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Pour the salt, now!
I wish Luz thought that too.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What is this?
Ugh!
I never understand when you do this.
Seriously, what is that?
That's my girl!
Yeah, that's right.
Luz is my student.
Back off, academy twerps.
Ah, baby's first wanted poster.
Good job, kid.
Looks like I taught you something after all.
Probably an offering.
Being the most powerful witch in the Boiling Isles has its perks.
Witches eating babies is so 1693.
What is this?
Nope.
Babies are awful.
Not happening.
She's the wealthiest demon on the Boiling Isles.
Get in with her and you're set for life.
So, we keep this thing alive for a few hours and we get paid.
You have to return the books I checked out from the library.
I don't want her getting a cut of the loot.
Now, let's take a look at this little darling.
Argh!
On second thought maybe we could use your help!
We got this, right?
Whoa!
Ugh.
I hate it too, pip-squeak.
But think about the money.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.
Say that again and I steal your tongue.
For the money.
That's insane.
Aah, there's only one way out of this.
Apple slices and story time.
All right, brats.
Let's do this.
Ugh.
Being parental is making me sick.
Otabin spend his days alone amongst the many books he'd sewn.
Where are the babies?
And I just taught Junior how to pick locks too.
We did it all for the money.
Thanks, kid.
So, how was your night?
I smell an easy mark.
Hey, kid!
Can I offer you the latest fashions from... the human realm?
Well, I hate her.
Luz!
Stop that.
You may be forgetting something, Luz.
I'm kinda... on the run!
Every guard in town would be at my doorstep if I had my name in lights.
You're pampered all day like a dang baby.
How hard is that life?
Well, there's only one thing to do when friends can't see eye to eye.
Pfft, no.
Body swap!
I love a good body swap.
It's like demonic possession with the ones you love.
Body swap!
How do I look?
All right, here's the deal.
Whoever can prove their new body has the easiest life gets out of house cleaning duty.
And you know what that means.
That's cute.
If you need me, I'll be getting pampered on a vacation fit for a king.
Oh, hello.
Yes, hello to you too, handsome.
An emperor's guard.
Wait, you know who I am?
That's more like it.
You got nothing!
Being King is a walk in the park.
I'm gonna win this bet for sure.
What's that?
Whoa!
Hey, I'm not lost, you creeps!
Ooh.
You know what?
Maybe I am lost.
Take me away, ladies.
Ugh...
What hot mess is going down here?
Well, my creep alarm is ringing, but I can't argue with num-nums.
Oh, being adorable is the life.
Time for a nap.
You hear that, Bowtie?
There's a new star in town.
Okay, I'm out.
Novelty costumes are where I draw the line.
Ladies, stand back.
I am not above disrespecting my elders.
Oh, dang.
I'm not a witch right now.
Not today, sister!
Stop babying me!
This vacation just took an alarming, back-alley turn.
Geez, I thought I liked being babied.
But I feel so small and helpless, like some sort of... baby.
But that won't happen to us, right?
I failed you, Bowtie.
My closest ally.
I'll avenge you, Bowtie!
Ooh!
Huh?
You can have it.
Your life is pretty terrible.
But, hey, it'll probably be over soon.
Luz!
Bring my dang body over here.
I got the same question.
All right.
Did everybody learn a valuable lesson about experiencing each other's hardships?
Good, let's end this nightmare.
Body swap!
Thanks, Luz.
Don't worry, I got this.
Body swap!
Aw, that's sweet, kid.
Now, let's never speak of this again.
Please, no.
Not the comedy hour...
It just goes on like this for an hour!
Yes, she'll be back... she always comes back.
It's cute you miss her, though.
Junk, junk, death hex.
Oh, a carnival's in town today!
Carnivals bring crowds and crowds bring suckers.
This could be the perfect chance to try out my new get-witch-quick scheme.
I'm in!
Well, here we are, kids.
Look at all that fresh meat.
No games for you, Owlbert, we've got scams to run.
Tibbles?
You sent this?
I don't buy it.
What kind of con are you running?
Oh yeah, sure!
I know poison when I see it... you can't scam a scammer!
Beat it loser!
Step right up to... Eda's Human Horror House!
Humans shed their skin and I've got proof.
Round as the moon, her ears are, with mood swings as terrifying as night itself.
Now, who wants to touch an outdated human reference?
Ah, what are you?
The fun police?
Uh, excuse me, sir.
I'd like to have a word with your staff.
Owlbert!
Owlbert!
Where are you?
Owlbert, you're lucky I can't be mad at your adorable antics.
I hate carnivals.
Just when I thought I couldn't respect the law any less... it surprises me.
Spare me the yuks.
What do you want?
Caramel Crab Apples.
Get 'em hot and pinchy.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold your spider-horses.
Hey, hey.
No discounts, buddy.
Dumb kids?
Wait.
Those are my dumb kids!
Oh, no, Tibbles.
That's not how entertainment works.
The bad guy always gets his just desserts.
Hey, girls.
This one's on the house.
Nah.
I think I got everything I wanted.
Yep.
Another great year at the carnival.
But nothing.
Bump did you a favor.
There ain't nothing for you at that dweebus factory.
No offense, dweebus.
Oh, you think you're clever, huh?
Can it, King!
First off, it's the Bad Girl Coven and second off, I guess you don't want in on the T-shirt order, huh?
I mean, yeah, well, I don't wanna hear another word about Hexside, unless it's Hexside is on fire and let's grab front row seats!
I'm trying to protect her.
Hexside chews up anything unique and spits out bland mush.
But that's my beef.
Does she need to draw her own conclusions?
You're just gonna be unhelpful, huh?
I gotta get that girl into school.
Ugh.
I had this nightmare before.
Been quite a while since I've sat here, huh?
I gotta admit it's extra weird without you yelling at me for picking fights or stealing.
I want to enroll my human, Luz, at Hexside.
You no-good... Wait, really?
Oh right.
Yeah.
I heard all about that abomination incident.
Huh.
I thought there'd be more.
I don't wanna do this!
Meh!
The girls' changing room is ghost-free.
They're just as bad as Luz.
She'd love it here.
All right.
What's next, Bumpikins?
I washed off all the graffiti.
Apologized to Jenkinmeyer for stealing her teeth.
Caught all the wild cerebi.
Ah, we should be good.
And you won't tell the Emperor's Coven about this, will you?
Guess who got you into Hexside!
Ugh, kid.
Come on, kid.
Let's go.
Huh.
Dang, dweebus.
Uh, hold on.
Hold on.
I'm only doing this because I have faith in you.
And I know you're too smart to fall for that One-Witch, One-Coven nonsense.
You can learn a lot from the witches here.
And maybe teach them some of that Bad Girl Coven magic too.
Wait!
I gotta do more stuff?
Ugh!
You better enjoy this place, kid.
Nah kid, you got this, just do what we practiced!
Hey.
Calm down, calm down.
I had to do the same thing when I was a witchling.
It's like a rite of passage.
Granted, I was a little more skilled.
Right, right.
Sorry, sorry.
Now, get pumped.
Get ready.
Now, go!
Improvise.
Right, you gotta calm down.
What are you nervous about?
You've been to school before.
Hey, don't worry about what those dorks think.
If you want my advice, walk into class and punch the first kid you see.
To establish dominance.
Last chance to back out, and earn a new Bad Girl Coven patch.
Quitting. It's like trying, but easier.
Hold up!
Just try not to be too much of a goody Luz shoes.
You got this.
Whoops!
A gust of wind just got me.
See you after school!
Byeeee!
Boiling rain!
Everybody inside now!
Phew!
That was close.
But the important thing is you didn't get hurt.
Yeah, we don't have weather.
We have plagues, gorenados, shale hail, painbows.
So, until the boiling rain stops, no one is allowed outside tonight.
Well, whatever the case, this force field spell should protect the house from boiling rains and made-up demons.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
'Cause I'm so wise.
No, I don't.
It sparkles and shimmers.
It shines and delights.
I must have it for my nest...
Ugh.
That force field really took it out of me.
Ahh!
Whatever it is, no.
I'm not teaching you magic tonight.
I'm sleepy.
I'm a sleepy little owl.
Ooh!
I respect your cunning, but I also hate you for it.
If you want a witch's staff like mine, don't make me repeat myself.
Witch's staffs have power embedded into them.
But before one is earned, every witch needs to know how to cast spells on their own.
Now tonight I will show you how to create light.
Now, humans think magic is made out of thin air, but that's stupid.
Everything comes from something.
Let me ask you, kid.
Where do you think magic comes from?
Actually, you're right.
No, really.
It comes from a sac of magic bile attached to a witch's heart.
Now, everything depends on the spell circle.
The bigger the circle, the more powerful the spell.
You know, I'm not actually sure.
I know witches did magic differently in the past, but I never bothered to figure out how.
Don't worry.
You'll figure it out.
Now I need to lie down.
Fine.
Ooh, boy.
Ahh!
W-What happened?
Oh, I have the worst headache.
And my mouth tastes like roadkill.
Hmm?
I was looking for that.
King?
King!
You stole my elixir?
Wow.
How is she doing that?
Well, you better be.
I got a long list of disgusting chores with your name on it.
But it's not entirely your fault.
I haven't been completely honest with you guys.
When I was younger, I was cursed.
Well, that's why people call me the Owl Lady.
No one likes having a curse, but if you take the right steps, it's manageable.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
It's all under control, and as long as no one steals my elixir then I'm fine.
But, hey, look at this.
A human doing magic.
Good on you, kid.
No, not this memory again.
You're the one who cursed me, aren't you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
So, you set Willow's memories on fire and erased everything.
Even minor damage can have huge effects!
Yep, her brain's burned up real good.
Damage like that can change everything about a person.
Willow may never be the same.
Nap time.
I didn't cast it on you.
There is one way, but it's terribly dangerous and partially illegal.
So you're in the right place!
I'll send you into her mind to fix the damage.
It won't be easy.
You have a lot to fix in there, 'cause it's a mess!
Yep, whoever did this to Willow showed unbelievable disregard for her safety, downright despicable.
Oh right, it was you.
Anyways, Luz, who's going inside with you?
This is someone's brain, not a night club!
Alright!
Bold choice, taking the girl who caused the mess.
When you're done, ring that and I'll cast you back... 
Oh, and keep an eye out for her Inner Willow.
She's the gatekeeper of emotions and memory.
She might help ya.
Now, here we go!
Ahem.
If you need an interview, look no further.
Interesting?
I'm a bad girl living in a secret fortress.
Shh!
I'm public enemy number one.
I'm the greatest witch who ever lived!
Just give up, King, 'cause I got this.
Wha?
The kid scares me.
How's that for interesting?
There's levels to me kid, levels I say!
Who got the gig, kid?
Hooty?
Ooooh, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna bake that bird in a pie!
Huh?
Oh, right, I put people in there.
He's fine, he's just dead to us.
Ah, Grudgby season is the best.
You know, I used to play, back in my gory days.
Well, that too.
I was unstoppable on the field.
I had the best moves and the best cheats.
Ugh.
What do humans know, with your goody-goody attitude?
If cheaters never prosper, why was I the star player?
All this talk of Grudgby has me feeling nostalgic.
Whaddya say you and me take a little trip down memory lane?
That's the spirit.
Ugh.
Come on!
And here's when we took down Epiderm High in the semi-finals.
Oh, I was the youngest on the team, but I had what some call star power.
This is my cheat box.
I have all my best weapons in here.
Oh, I never lost a game with this bad boy.
Lilith.
Ugh.
Scram, Hooty.
No reason.
It's laundry day.
What are you doing here?
You were saying?
Ooh, Aah.
What an incredible opportunity for me.
Pah!
Never.
I was just telling King here how good I was.
Ah, tell you what.
I'll go with you peacefully to the Emperor... Sure. If you beat me at a game of Grudgby.
Luz is always challenging people to things.
Why not me?
Yeah, intimidation armor.
Pushing paper all day might make you a little rusty.
I'll try to go easy on you.
Hooty!
Whose side are you on?
Just one little trick and the game will be mine.
Dang it, Luz!
Your nonsense has gotten into my head.
Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way.
Not today, sister.
Yeah!
Yes!
Still got it!
Still got the skills to pay the bills!
Here.
Tell them I put up a heck of a struggle.
I'll be waiting.
Of course not.
Keep cheering.
Welcome to... the Owl House.
Hmm?
Ugh!
Who are you, again?
Kid, lay off the details.
I haven't even had my cup of apple blood yet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, kid.
Being a witch doesn't happen overnight.
Also, you're wrapped in a bathrobe and wearing the dirtiest traffic cone I've ever seen.
But a magic staff, huh?
You really want one?
Magic staff, come to me!
It's early.
Now, witches are awarded their staffs from school.
With me as your teacher, you'll be taking a different approach.
You'll have to work for it.
I run a few businesses.
On weekends, I offer rare human treasures that Owlbert drags over from your side of the realm.
But most days I sell only the finest homemade elixirs and potions.
No one wants an un-oiled snake.
Follow me.
Today you'll deliver packages and sell potions to that town over there, Bonesborough.
You'll have to be careful.
I have rivals everywhere who'd love to take my business down and you along with it.
You wanted a dangerous magical quest?
Sister, you've got one.
I'm sure.
Remember, never befriend a man in sandals and always measure twice, cut once.
Good luck!
I hate to interrupt your power nap, but you have to go with her.
You and I know she's either going to get lost or eaten, probably both.
And because you work for me, too, unless you want to start paying rent.
Be back by nightfall or risk mortal peril.
Oh, you guys talking about bad girls?
Wait, what's going on?
Ugh!
Wizards are the worst.
Never trust a man in casual drapery.
Why?
Wait, wait, Luz?
Let me see this map.
You didn't think this was real, did you?
This map is bunk.
There's no lake with a Celestial Staff on the Boiling Isles.
I would have stolen it ages ago.
Ah, don't worry.
Couple more months here and you won't look like such a mark.
Crony, wake up.
You said that wizard was one of my clients?
I don't know him that well.
And I don't trust this itch he's scratching in the human.
Hey, Luz?
Aw, nuts.
Hooty, where'd she go?
Ugh!
I don't like this.
I really don't like this.
Oh, no.
Are you sure she came here?
Hmm.
Hey!
Wake up, you.
What have you done with Luz?
What's your endgame?
It's a trap.
They want me to follow Luz.
Hmm.
I know this guy.
He's no wizard.
He's what you'd call a puppeteer, a demon who specializes in scamming and manipulating people.
He's trying to use Luz to get to me.
Well, if you can think of a better plan, I'd love to hear it.
Hey, faster, you.
That's right.
You have me.
Now release Luz.
Luz!
Well, that's the last time I take an outside referral.
Mmm.
Oh, did you want some of that?
Thinking of calling it quits, huh?
Hmm.
Maybe not here.
But come with me.
I got something to show you.
Okay, you can look.
The bones of the Isles.
Up close, the Isles can be slimy and gross.
But if you look at it from a different perspective...
Look, kid, everyone wants to believe they're chosen.
But if we all waited around for a prophecy to make us special, we'd die waiting.
And that's why you need to choose yourself.
Not yet.
But... someday.
That's a no.
It'll take some time to get used to this.
Thanks, kid.
I look forward to that.
Where am I?
What is this?
Aw farts, I got caught.
You stay away from her, or so help me, Titan...
Tough, 'cause I ain't telling you nothing!
Wait!
Don't touch her!
Lilith, don't let him hurt her!
Lilith!
Luz?
Oh no, oh no no no no no... what are you doing here?
Your magic isn't strong enough for this.
You need to leave!
Now.
Listen to me.
I'm here because of my own actions.
I went against Belos's law, and for a while I was able to get away with it.
But, well without magic, I can't do much.
I don't regret anything.
I lived freely and... I got to meet you.
But if you stay here, I won't be able to protect you.
You need to leave.
Now!
You have a family already.
Go back to them.
And when you're home, use your fire magic to destroy the portal door.
I don't know why Belos wants it, but we can't take any chances.
I love you too, kiddo.
Luz, get away!
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Luz.
Lilith.
You hurt Luz.
You cursed me.
Before anything turns me to stone, I'll tear you apart.
What?
As good as I'll ever be.
Let's fly.
Take me to my... I mean the Owl Lady's confiscated junk!
Hey you, fellow guard!
We just found a lot of illegal Hexis Holdem Cards.
Can we get the key to the warehouse?
Why's everything going our way now?
Woo, boy, we're gonna need to split up if we want to find Francois.
Awaiting further instructions, Head Witch.
What kind of language is that?
That's right!
My curse warps magic.
Huh, did quite a number on you two if I remember correctly.
You haven't had your curse that long.
You don't know how it would react.
But I do.
And how can I say no to sticking it to Belos one final time?
Not only that, but I've got the Raine Whispers watching out for me.
There you are.
Look what I got!
The coat's finally dry.
I thought you'd carve something cute, like a tarantula.
Why an egg?
Try to play them music sometime.
They can hear you.
Can you believe I gotta pretend to be a coven head?
Well, of course I don't.
You know, even before the curse I couldn't stand covens.
Only a select few can learn about different types of magic.
It made no sense.
But..
if it's the only way to stop this, then I'm gonna do it.
But as exciting as saving the world sounds, it's not nearly as romantic as going on a rescue mission to save your girlfriend.
Ooh, but you wanna.
It's written all over your face.
Hey, us adults can handle ourselves.
Tell bossy boots I said, Yo.
We'll see each other after the Day of Unity.
When we succeed.
We have the advantage, after all.
We've got King the Titan and Luz the Human on our side.
Legends in the making!
So, you two protect each other, and we'll be back together before you know it.
Hmm?
Where'd everyone go?
Man, they made a mess in here.
Oh well.
It's been a while since I had room to put my feet up.
Oh, no!
Not again!
Get out of here!
I'll hold it back and meet you outside.
You can't beat this thing.
It's been a while.
Miss me?
It can't get past the entrance.
We're safe now.
You aren't lying.
You just don't know the truth.
It's time for me to tell you how we really met.
Eight years ago I was looking for a place to hide from the Emperor's Coven.
I never knew this place existed and it just... appeared out of the mist.
So, I landed.
Now, I was one hot tamale, but the boiling rains were even hotter.
I needed shelter.
But when I found it... I wasn't alone.
I assumed you were just some stray dog.
But then... that thing was gonna kill us both, so I picked you up and bounced.
Against my better judgment, I took you home with me.
I'd gotten you the collar, ‘cause... well, that's what you do when you get a new pet.
And that's how you got the idea you were some despotic overlord.
Oh, but you were finally happy.
So I kept playing along with it.
I'm not.
For now, let's split up.
This island is small, and he's even smaller.
He can't have gone far.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
King!
You're alright!
You're mad at me.
I get it.
I would be, too.
I'm so sorry, King.
Only truths.
I promise.
You sure they'll be alright?
Are you sure they'll be alright?
Nothing here!
Huh, I think we're safe... for now.
But how did we get the door open?
Are you sure?
That thing was defending King from us this whole time?
Huh.
Alright.
I've never seen markings like this.
Hmmm... 
Ooh, is it some kind of ancient language?
Any ideas, mystery whisperer?
Whoo!
Ah don't mind me, I'm just learning how to turn into Harpy Eda on command.
According to these human workouts, you just gotta scream a lot until you force your inner beast out.
What?
No, it's only... 30 years old?
I remember seeing this in theaters.
Chill bossy boots, everything's fine!
Please, she just has the Common Mold.
It's harmless!
Alright Luz, me and King will get your Titan blood if you just CALM.
DOWN.
I get it, boots, just grab a coat.
Willow, Goops, watch over Luz.
She thinks she has snakes for arms.
Titan blood is the most powerful source of magic on the isles.
I'm not surprised Belos wants it too.
Not so fast, King.
Don't you recognize that annoying voice?
Don't let him get away!
This is none other than Belos' right-hand man.
Huh-uh!
Did I do it?
Did I go into harpy mode?
Huh, this stuff is old.
Go on, fire it!
Maybe the adrenaline will kick in and bam!
Harpy Eda!
Huh, you must be fun at parties.
Hey King, how about you use your new powers to echolocate the lake?
You know, Luz told me about a trip to Latissa where she met someone very interesting.
A beat-up blonde with no magical powers, she called him and these are her words: A bad but sad boy.
Oh, that poor girl is going through something.
We should create a distraction!
You kids wait for my signal.
Okay watch this, I'll be the ghost of miner's past and spook'em out!
Why didn't you wait for our signal?
Is this... Titan's blood?
Oh, so you can keep it all for yourself?
Pfft, hard pass!
Oh, just barely.
Owlbert's knocked out so we can't fly.
I don't know how!
I've tried yelling at it, scaring it-
Hah!
I... I guess I didn't but it, it's a wild animal.
Okay I'll try, just... ugh, give me a second.
What?
You want to make a deal?
Wait I- I don't know if I can!
Okay okay, I'll do it, just change NOW!
Luz needs a new coat.
King needs to be checked for fleas.
Am I missing anything?
Oh, you've changed, Owl Lady.
It's worth it.
Everyone's leaving, huh?
Even King.
I guess I'm no substitute for the real thing.
Welp, nothing like a good distraction.
Has my magic returned?
Oh, guess not.
Stupid curse.
How are you supposed to be Head Bard with stage fright?
Closet.
So why are you suddenly so interested in flying?
Did you give up on returning to the human realm?
I mean, I suppose you can stay here a little longer.
Oh, that's... great.
Leave... the talkin' for later.
If you want to win, there's no time for talk.
You gotta go practice.
Now.
I just... don't wanna hear him say it, you know?
I was finally getting used to having people in the house, then whoosh!
Rug's ripped out from underneath me.
Throw it on my tab, Kevin.
Let her go!
How's that for powerless?
End of the line folks, word of advice.
Next time you put on a performance like that, make sure you have an exit strategy.
Well, you could let me join your little team.
Hey, I may not have magic, but I am an agent of chaos.
Is that any way to treat an old friend, Raine Whispers?
So, the Head Witch of the Bard Coven likes pretending to be a rebel.
Too bad they're not very good at it.
Uh, maybe later.
I'll be there.
I promise!
Well, there you have it.
Homemade maps of every nook and cranny in the city.
Don't worry, kids.
Mama's got a plan.
and 1 Guard Captain are arresting and escorting cloaked witches into a gold and white vehicle with the sigil of the Emperor's Coven on it.
Amber hides in a corner with her flute in hand as one of the Coven Scouts closes the back door to the vehicle.
As the first team is rounding up witches on Hexan Road, Amber will sneak in and take 'em out.
Before anyone calls for help, Derwin and Katya will distract the second team by Skinford Avenue.
That's where Raine comes in.
And if everything goes well, I'll be guiding the escapees outside Bonesborough.
Belos has less reach outside the cities.
I can't believe it's already morning.
Rainestorm.
Oh, you've gotten so strong.
It's incredible.
But how'd you become Head Bard with your stage fright?
Well, you remember the curse.
It messes with my magic.
All right.
You asked for this.
Raine's Rhapsody.
More like Eda's Requiem, am I right?
I-I'll leave the playing to the professionals.
Call if you need me.
Well, if it's so important, we can talk about it after the race when you win, okay?
No, it's fine.
I'm on my way.
So that means?
I am glad I remembered how to do that.
Ooh, gross.
Say no more, Rainestorm.
What's the plan?
It's working.
Keep playing.
But it'll stop the emperor, right?
Then we play on.
Uh, they're not mine-mine.
Well, it doesn't matter.
They both have real families to return to.
Raine, don't.
You were flying like the dang wind.
What happened?
No, this isn't over.
No one watches crystal balls anymore.
It's all about streaming.
Is that what you wanted to tell me this whole time?
Welcome to the Owl House, folks.
Hope this place wasn't too hard to find.
King... King... King, come on.
It's time to wake up.
We're about to find out.
Luz is ready to talk.
This is just a lot to take in.
King, Hooty, you know what to do.
Well, one thing's for sure.
People can tell when you've been inside their head.
It's only a matter of time before Belos sends his scouts over here.
You need to hide.
Hey, no pity parties in this house.
Besides, Luz is upset enough as it is.
Hooty, you gotta stop eating garbage from the ground.
Well, I say you two need a safe place to hide while the adults take care of things.
What if something goes wrong?
Yeah, well, how- how would they even get there?
Fine.
You can go.
We'll find out all we can on our end to create a plan for uh... uh, when you get back.
Oh, this is so much bigger than I imagined, Lily.
I thought Luz was just some lost kid, but because of me she's wrapped up in this thing with Belos and it- it's just not fair.
She and King are children.
They shouldn't have to deal with this.
Alright, let's get to work.
Me neither.
What kind of jerk puts The in front of their name anyway?
Luz, I've got leg hair older than you.
This Philip guy worked on his door for years.
Try not to beat yourself up too much.
Not really, but... Back in the day, I was a bit of an urban-legend junkie.
Yeah sure, kid.
Anyway, there are stories about these things called Time pools.
Mythical puddles that act as windows into the past, but they're never in the same spot twice.
Me and Lily used to search for them.
She'd say I forced her into it, but I think she had more fun than me.
Hey, Ma.
Why are you still in town?
Forget something from yesterday?
Well, tell him I'm busy.
Years!
Yep, been years, I know.
I'm, uh, just sharpening my tooth.
Don't want Pops to see me looking all blech, you feel?
It's not like I'm scared of him.
I just haven't seen him since I ruined his- I mean since the Owl Beast ruined his- I'm just not ready, okay?
Now move it.
I gotta scram.
Apologies, dearest mother.
Dearest sister has flown the dearest coop.
But worry not, for I, the perfect, prissy little Lily, shall find her for you.
Not today, suckers!
Hi, dad.
Sorry, I, uh, haven't been in touch.
There's been a lot going on.
Yep, King's a Clawthorne.
He can be a handful, but-
Then stop!
I've ruined your life.
Have you even been able to carve a new Palisman since I attacked you?
Stop trying to forgive me.
I don't deserve it.
What is that?
Did you come all the way here just to brag?
Hey nerds!
How was your nerd quest?
You find that dead nerd?
Whoa, seriously?
Uh, you gu- you guys need to stop that.
Double glyph combo, go!
Oh dang, I was hoping more of an ice blast situation.
Ugh, you're as boring as Lilith.
Yes!
Teacher's gone!
Hah, I wonder what other combos I can try.
Basics are so basic.
Now if we want to be powerful again we're gonna have to start thinking outside the box!
Well, I'm more interested in experimentation, innovation and uh, laughing at tools!
 Like you!
Hah!
Okay, almost got it...
Glyph pyramid!
It's supposed to prove that I'm the superior witch.
Watch and learn.
Ugh, okay let's think.
Bile sacs have different spell phlegm sloshing around together.
So why can't I mix these up too?
Hmmm... I don't have time for basics.
I'm on to something, and I'll prove it!
I call it the super glyph!
Just you wait, this'll be a killer combo.
Lesser glyphs will shrink in fear.
Hah!
It didn't blow up!
Uh-huh... Totally normal!
Don't come in!
I am your mother!
You will obey me and die!
Ugh, fine!
Lilith, emergency!
Yeah yeah, I messed up.
I'm ready to follow the rules.
Okay so, uh, how did you beat that thing again?
Was like screaming 3 different words at the same time!
The spell got confused!
So with the right combo, you can cast any spell!
Then we better start learning some new combinations.
Hey Luz!
We actually learned something new!
I can do it too.
Yeah!
When she meets us, I'll make sure to put on the charm... that turns people into obedient zombies.
Ah, it's just a fancy way to kiss the Emperor's
I'm just here to pick something up.
Did you read my diary?
Stop it!
Stop it, stop it!
Yes!
They secretly led a rebel group against the Emperor and got captured!
I was there!
Well, good job.
You broke Luz.
According to this, Raine is still working with the Emperor's Coven which doesn't make sense.
They were seen as a traitor!
If they're here for the parade, they'll probably be surrounded by scouts.
Oh, we'd need someone on the inside to lend us a hand.
Yeah, right.
As if she'd give us the time of day.
This is true... Ugh, fine!
Oh, it's not that romantic.
Is that our float?
Let's move.
Knock it off, you two.
Let's get crackin'.
Raine, I'm so glad you're okay!
I had to make sure you were okay after that fight with Darius and Eber.
It was just a few weeks ago.
I was with you.
I'm not leaving till I get through to you.
Please.
Rainestorm stop it.
Come on, Raine!
I know when you're going easy on me.
Did you forget this too?
So phony.
He's just trying to distract us from his crazy utopia talk!
Too bad it won't work.
Hello?
Prim?
Did you get into the Night Juice again?
Hello?
Hey, Prim!
Ah, there you are.
I need more witch's wool.
I got a kid with cold shoulders and a knack for gettin' into trouble.
I mean, I know I can be... abrasive, but, Hey, I'll be fine.
You're the one who needs to be careful.
And who is he, really?
Listen, Belos has been Emperor for 50 years.
Everyone is used to this.
No one's gonna risk change unless you have proof that he's up to something.
Ah, come on.
We'll figure something out.
But first, let's see if there are any respectable criminals left in this city.
Luz, where are you?
Oh, wait.
Hey, blondie, your friend wants to talk to you.
How in the world did you- No, we don't have time for that.
Has the Inner Belos spotted you yet?
But I have heard of strong emotions materializing.
Just stay safe.
If you're devoured in his mindscape-
Just don't lose the walkie-talkie.
It's our only connection to you.
Hooty, I need you to lock down the house.
Windows shut, curtains drawn, absolutely zero distractions.
King, go grab all the textbooks you can find.
This is gonna be tough without magic.
Hooty!
Chop-chop!
Bones, dirt, and muck!
I don't have time to fail!
Hooty, that thing could be booby-trapped.
Get it outta here.
It's the teleportation potion into the mindscape!
Hold up.
It says it still needs a power source.
And a big one.
But... that's the last of Luz's Titan Blood.
She needs it to get back home!
Kid, you there?
We're getting you two out.
She's not answering!
Luz?
Luz!
Luz, we're gonna start the countdown.
Are you ready?
Don't crowd them!
Are you two okay?
Kid, breathe.
Luz, what did you see?
Hey, knucklehead.
You're gonna be late for school.
Aright.
I guess you won't be getting a magic staff with your classmates.
There we go.
Now, traditionally, young witches carve their staffs from the branch of an old Palistrom tree.
Thanks for the favor BQ.
Here's your whistle back.
You okay, Luz?
I'd thought I'd find you here.
It's palistrom wood, ya ding-dong!
Let's just say that the Bonesborough Garden Club--
No pressure, but whenever you know what you want, we'll start carving.
Eh, there's no rush.
Just know that whatever you need from us, we gotcha.
Ah, there we go.
Mama like.
We ran out of apple blood.
Still no luck?
I wish I could help ya, kid.
My door was already pretty old when I found it.
Well... Calm down, just calm down.
The curse acts stronger when you're stressed.
Well, it's been hard.
But since we split the curse, at least the elixirs are working again.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Side effect of the curse.
It's actually fun once in a while.
Now don't worry.
I've stashed elixirs all over the house.
Whenever you start feeling feathery, just help yourself to one of these bad boys.
Eh, at least I got company now.
And you got me if you need anything.
As I was saying, I've had the portal door for years.
But I originally just found it in the dirt.
Never figured out who made it or where it came from.
I just kept it to myself.
Why?
Suddenly curious about my past?
Well, I may have been using it to hide from someone.
Gwendolyn.
Oh, no.
Here it comes.
No, thanks.
I said, No, thanks.
 I got my elixir system.
I'm good.
Actually, I do.
And... would you look at the time?
I got a lot to do today.
So sad to see you go.
Okay, bye!
Moms.
Am I right?
Oh, listen, she comes around every year, toting a new cure for my curse.
But they never work, so I am done getting my hopes up.
Oh, baby, time to stock up on Mama's night juice.
Knife season came early this year.
This... better be... the oldest, strongest, stinkiest apple blood ever.
I just stole these.
Help Mama up.
Ugh.
Woo, this ain't good.
What is going on here?
What?
This was all you?
You weren't healing me.
You nearly killed me!
Why?
Why should I be calm?
I have a right to be UP-SET!
Ooh, let's get this over with.
Uh, Mom?
Mom, I can hear you.
My turn to drive.
About time, Mom.
Yeah, you should've.
But, hey, don't be a stranger.
Okay, Mom?
Well, I'll be on the couch for the next 24 hours.
Good night.
I'm freaking out, Hooty.
Belos is planning something big, and I'm weaker than a newborn witchling.
If I wanna protect you guys, I have to train as hard as I can to get strong!
No rest!
I SAID NO REST!
Sleep?
Not until I can call myself the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles once again!
Hmm.
A reward for all your hard work.
Love, Hooty Hmm.
Not a bad idea.
I could use the fuel.
Dang, owl boy can bake.
Sleeping nettles?
Sleeping nettles don't just put you to sleep, they heighten your dreams!
Do you realize who you just stuck me with?
Hooty, don't let me fall asleep!
You know, maybe this is an opportunity.
The Owl Beast is why I ran away from home.
The Owl Beast is why I never got close to anyone.
And the Owl Beast-
Is why I don't have magic.
Ha, you've haunted me long enough, bird brain.
I think it's time for me to haunt you.
Huh?
It wasn't your fault.
IT WAS YOURS!
Just tell them!
Let them help!
Stop pushing them away!
It was always you!
It was all your fault!
It's okay.
Now I thought these were a way to fight you, but... I think they're the reason we can stand here face to face.
Listen, neither of us want to be here, but... we are, and there's no changing that.
If we can't accept each other, this nightmare will never end.
So what do you say?
Truce?
For now?
It's like sandpaper.
Wow.
I've never had a dream this pretty.
Ugh, my head!
Huh?
Oh jeez, did I turn again?
You don't think they changed the locks after you got booted from the Coven?
Hey!
I come up with some great ideas!
over her head.
Someone's tripped the booby trap.
What map are you talking about?
The one we left them!
What the-?
Oh, so you found of a commune of bloodthirsty fanatics in a place that was supposed to be empty!
I can't believe that little guy is gonna turn into that big guy.
And he falls into the toilet like once a day.
Don't worry Luz, we're not putting him in danger.
He's a Clawthorne and technically your nephew, remember, dear sister?
Uh, right.
Well... it's a secret!
Just for now.
I'll fill you in closer to go time!
Tell her what?
That we have no plan?
That Belos is gonna win?
That the Boiling Isles are doomed?
The kids deserve one nice day before they realize how dire things are.
Alright, kids!
The uh... plan isn't gonna be ready till tomorrow, but if you could do anything if you could do anything in the world today, what would it be?
Of course you do.
Are you sure you wanna do this for a stuffed toy?
Wouldn't you rather, oh I don't know, have a beach day?
Hold up!
If we're gonna do this we gotta do it right.
Belos isn't taking any more chances with us after your little trip into his mind.
If we wanna stay alive we have to be inconspicuous
If things get hairy, you fly out of here as fast as you can.
Hey!
Don't give me that face, just say okay, okay?
Oh, and if you find a box labelled Eda's Longest Toenails, grab that too.
Please just give me a minute, I'm not trying to stir trouble.
And I am working it!
Listen, I don't know what you're hiding, but I do know that somewhere deep inside you still care about me, otherwise you wouldn't let me walk free at the Coven Parade.
Raine, I know about the Day of Unity and the Draining Spell.
Nope, I, I saw that expression!
It is that bad, isn't it?
That's why I , I need your help.
Wait!
This is for my kids.
They can't be around during the Day of Unity.
Put them in a castle, bunker, get them on an airship, I don't care!
Just, just, keep them safe!
If you do, I'll give myself up right now.
It's because there IS no plan, okay?
Me and Lilith don't have magic and we don't have allies, we're useless.
We have you and King.
So, I wasn't gonna do anything to make sure that you were safe.
But now, it's all over.
Luz, Luz!
It's okay.
Raine, why didn't you tell me anything?
I could've helped.
I guess not.
King, can you stop telling people that?
And it has something to do with the Day of Unity.
But, with this, he'll tell me everything I need to know.
Dang.
The fire needs to be hotter.
Keep stirring while I find more fuel.
What the heck happened?
You changed the recipe?
Don't you have family stuff to clear up?
Also, I heard about the factory incident with Luz.
I've got my eyes on you, Blight.
What's going on at the castle?
What's really gonna happen on the Day of Unity?
Have Raine's memories been altered?
Are you kidding?
Instead of making a blabber serum, you made a horrifying transformation serum!
Well, the side effects aren't pretty, but I can sell this.
Illusions, beastkeeping, and potion magic?
Keep it up, kid.
You got a future in wild magic.
Check it, Luz!
A new hunting weapon.
I will call her the Stab-Catcher.
Hey, King, did you know that apple is a hat?
Luz!
Time to bring these bad boys to market!
I had to deal with a curse for 30 years, so I think you can handle a few feathers.
I see it too, Luz.
And I'm trying to stay civil.
A single snail?
Are you kidding me?
You can't do this to me.
Do you know who I am?
What the--
I don't need your pity.
I was the most wanted criminal for years.
You should fear me.
Hmm... We gotta keep a low profile while my powers are weakened.
And we need fast cash.
How about this guy?
No, no, no.
I hear it's very dangerous.
And look, there he is.
Things aren't looking great, Lily.
This bounty hunting stuff isn't putting food on the table.
Oh, I'm sure Luz could handle bigger bounties, but if we wanna eat we don't have the luxury to mess up even once.
No apple blood.
I spent the money on griffin eggs for Luz.
There's not a lot she can digest here, so I make sure to have her favorites around.
Hey, Lily!
How do I look?
Getting scammed at the market was such a bummer, but it gave me an idea on how to earn a little more cash.
You wanna come?
I may not be at full power, but I can still make potions!
Aight.
Have fun wallowing in self-pity and feeling bad for cursing me.
Byeeeeeee!
It's called disguising your tracks.
Now, why were you on that ship to begin with?
You coulda gotten killed!
You don't know that!
They're the only ones worth robbing.
Why are you guys hunting the Selkidomus?
It's a peaceful creature, and you're provoking it!
Well, I'm just gonna smack you around a bit!
Luz, wait!
Luz!
Luz, don't hurt the Selkidomus.
We can find another way out of this.
What's this alone business?
Don't you remember?
Us weirdos have to--
You think throwing your life away is gonna help me?
Well, it won't.
You helped me find King's crown when you barely knew me.
You saved me from turning to stone and you even got me talking to my sister again.
So, unfortunately for you, my life is pretty great, because I'm friends with Luz, the human.
Now, your guilt-ridden brain is clouding your judgement.
There's gotta be a way out of this, where no one has to get hurt.
My first glyph.
Did I do good?
Don't worry, King.
Once the mother saw we weren't a threat to her baby, she calmed down.
This area is dangerous.
You need to move further out into the sea.
Hot dang!
It gave you the treasure of the sea.
It's selkigris.
Ah, people pay big money for it at the Night Market.
Ah, feel that money, Luz.
Luxuriate in it.
What, you don't like to luxuriate?
There's a whole pile of luxury right in here.
Move over!
We're home.
Oh, Lily, you couldn't have been more right.
And that Golden Guard... what a chump.
Oh, I'm in a good mood.
Who wants to get takeout and draw faces on Hooty?
Alright, what do we wanna eat?
We're not ordering crackers.
Eugh.
What are you doing out here?
Maybe it's for the best.
I don't like that you're still thinking about that creep.
Let's take a break, huh?
Maybe I could tell you a story?
This is the story of how I met the coolest, baddest, kick-buttiest witch of all time: Raine Whispers.
And after that, we were inseparable.
Raine, you better be okay.
Are you sure this isn't gonna like, blow our faces off?
Well, here goes something.
Luz, as impressive as this is, I don't want you getting hurt.
Just be careful.
The human realm's filled with some real weirdos.
She's made it this far, we just have to trust her.
I'm sorry, I had to pull you out.
The portal was closing.
Well, just rest up now, okay?
And don't you worry, kiddo.
With everything we've learned, we'll have a real working portal in no time.
Who dubbed you a parent?
Aha, YES!
I don't want to talk about it.
Get to the lake, I'll take care of- AH!
UGH!
Alright Owl Beast, let's see what we can DO!
Haha, yes!
I heard fighting, I'm ready to go.
Where's that nerd?
Dang it.
Ow ow ow!
Just get an elixir.
Ugh I got into harpy mode and now I can't get out.
Hey, I had to keep up my end of the bargain.
You wanna break the news or should I?
The empty lake, the Golden Guard, losing the portal key, pfft, today was a disaster.
Hooty wait, it's okay!
Oh girl, this is a hot look.
Don't worry.
I think it's a good thing!
But where's Luz?
Did you do that?
Are you two okay?
No no no, Hooty!
You actually weirdly helped me!
I'm like a harpy woman now!
Luz, what was Hooty trying to do?
Oh, whoa.
Do you wanna?
Then do it!
Yeah, I hear you.
I might be able to help.
It won't be perfect, but huh, does it really need to be?
Good luck, kid!
Dang, Hooty, you really are something.
You're going with Raine!
They'll keep you safe!
Yes, I can.
Luz, please!
Raine will be here soon.
I'll have King join you afterwards.
It's time to go.
Hey, Wrath!
You still in there, buddy?
For now, but nothing phases this guy, and we have to turn him back to normal.
We don't have time for a new potion!
You got it, kiddo.
Well, this is a development.
Sorry, dream Mom, I don't have time for... whatever this is.
I'm on a mission.
It's so good to see you again.
Wait... I remember this, now.
I won't let you ruin this again!
Raine!
HAHA!
Uh, nothing!
I'm fine!
Okay okay, I know how this plays out.
I hope that I'll be ready this time.
You hear me, bird brain?
No no no, I hate this part.
Ha ha!
It's fine!
Everything's normal!
You can leave now!
Who's there?
Reveal yourself!
Who's there?
Reveal yourself!
Did you make all these?
What are you?
Ah, look at you.
A king amongst his subjects.
It spoke.
Yeah, that's right.
A king.
You know what else kings do?
They command armies and eat delicious feasts.
Raine... I know why you're really here.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you say.
All right.
Raine's Rhapsody.
 You know, you can't run from your fears forever, which is why you've gotta get the jump on them.
Give 'em a whack right in the face.
It always starts the same way.
I wake up someplace dark.
And then it appears.
And eventually... I wake up and I know I turned into... that thing.
I never knew this was back here.
Okay.
Titan's five humors.
It's... Breath!
Alright, alright.
On Scaburary 40th, the day Belos declared the Isles an empire...
Think fast!
Seven months isn't just around the corner.
Is it a waning or a waxing moon?
Yeah, sure it does!
I-If it's a waxing moon, it's a 2-to-1 mix, but if it's a waning moon, the Blackroot Quills lose their umph, and you gotta double down to a 4-to-1.
We'll prank together.
We'll kick butt together!
Take over the world together!
Nothing can stop the Clawthorne sisters!
Our rivals shall be CRUSHED beneath our feet!
Even the Titan shall gasp in fear!
Yeah.
Like that.
See?
We're gonna be fine.
Hey, Fausty.
Vice Princey B.
My innate talents?
My unbeatable charm?
Wow, this is really shocking.
I thought there'd be more.
Hmm.
Yeah, I do kinda rule.
What?
You can't do that, I'll be separated from Lily!
It was his birthday!
He liked it!
Please, Principal Faust, I'll do anything!
I can't believe I agreed to this.
That was a fun day.
Sounds easy enough.
Ta-da!
I'm here all night, folks.
I never should've come here.
Blech!
Even the free junk is junk!
Uh, no, I excel at functions such as these.
Didn't you see how impressed everyone was when I faked my death?
I even love the horrid liquids they serve.
Whoa!
Hey, that's actually good!
How'd you change the flavor?
All right, I get it.
If you whistle loud enough, can you make all this..
less of a drag?
Till wittle ole me?
How'd you get those?
All right, I'm Eda Clawthorne.
I wonder what I'll get a ribbon for.
Strength.
Wit.
Radiance.
Well, you're gonna get one for -- think fast!
Why do you come here?
You're not like the other kids.
You're -- I don't know, you're cool.
Made a deal with the devil.
Our principal's gonna expel me unless I come back with a ribbon.
Nah, I think I'm being too used to embarrass our vice principal.
As if he doesn't do that to himself already.
It stinks, but, I've got a sister at Hexside.
She's kind of my only friend.
It'd be a bummer if that got taken away.
I'm not goin' anywhere!
This is crazy!
That plant lady is off her gourd!
Not really.
Bard magic can be cool.
Yeah, well, we got tired of your stupid little challenge.
I hope this was worth it.
Lily!
I finally caught you.
I never got to tell you about that weird training thing over the weekend.
I was horrified.
If I lost, I was gonna get expelled and then we wouldn't be able to--
Go, go, go, don't be late.
Blech!
Ugh.
Huh?
Raine?
What are you doing here?
Oh- oh no, your scholarship!
Oh, you'll love it.
It's got all the secrets.
And since Terra spoke to Principal Faust, I can get away with pretty much anything!
I've never had Apple Blood before, this stuff is good!
