Sorry you couldn't get an invite to the conjuring, Willow.
Only real witches allowed.
Ugh!
Yes, Mom.
I'm going to a moonlight conjuring.
No, Mom.
You can't come.
And yes, Mom, it's sad that you're asking.
A talking house is giving me a lecture?
Whatever.
I'll just TP you like I did with the rest of the neighborhood.
Ugh.
So what if we couldn't move a doll.
Now we have time for what really matters.
Penstagram.
Does subtle mean ugly?
I'm just here to take an ironic Penstagram next to your weird flashing trash sign.
What are you going to do?
Spit your human venom on me?
Oh, he's so cute!
How much?
I have to own him.
Yeah, no.
Just give up.
Sure, you can.
Shut it.
New post: Loser human thinks she can hang out in our sacred Treasure Shack. Spoiler alert: She can't.
Hold up.
I did not give you permission to leave.
Enough!
I don't know why they can't remember what a weirdo loser you are, but I'm gonna help them remember.
Luz, I challenge you to a race... around Dead Man's Curve.
And we'll be racing on those Giant rat worms.
Bye-bye.
Get her!
Get back here, human!
I think I saw her go this way.
Too wiggly.
Too obvious.
Now we're talkin'!
I think today is a talons day... rawr!
You only turn every age once.
It's so weird that a human goes here now.
Too bad she's already burned her social life at the stake.
Any friend of Willow's is an automatic dork.
Ugh!
Why did you give me an invite that was molting?
Gross!
Give me another one.
I can't believe she'd even hang out with her!
It's just embarrassing.
Oh look at me!
I'm going on a date with my ferns!
I can't believe I made him cry.
Like, he's the teacher.
Why do you look like you've seen a ghost?
Is there a ghost in photo class?
Are they cute!
Ask if they have any friends!
You are talented.
You are a star.
You may be hated, so long as you are feared.
Most important of all, you are a winner.
Alright, girls.
You know the drill.
Captain goes first.
Hello, Hexside!
Your star has arrived.
Groveling line starts here.
Something’s not right.
Nobody’s here!
Wow, she has to make friends out of plants.
How sad.
Oh, this is not gonna fly.
Aw, Willow thinks she’s popular now.
How cute.
It’s weird that Amity hangs out with you now.
Ever since Grom, she’s gone soft.
But don’t worry.
I’m still here to show you who’s boss.
Oh-ho-ho!
The friends wanna get in on this too, huh?
My apologies, sir.
I was practicing my aim for Grudgby.
Oh, thanks, but I already have the perfect targets.
Hey Willow!
I just thought all trash should stay in one spot.
She what?
Okay, maybe it’s the altitude of the second floor, but I thought I heard you say that Leaf Girl wanted to challenge me to a Grudgby match.
Let’s do this.
Fine!
And when we win, Willow and your team will be our water gofers.
And we get to use you as target practice.
See you after school, losers.
It’s after school.
Where’s the leader of your loser brigade?
Wow, you’re really a good friend.
And a perfect target.
Think fast!
Having fun yet?
Cause I’m just getting warmed up.
Huh?
You need three players on your team.
Where’s your third?
You just destroyed your social life.
Ugh!
Game on!
Like I’d fall for that.
Hmm.
Yeah, while you were celebrating your victory, I caught this guy.
It means we automatically win.
All magic sports are like this.
Well, we beat them and proved our social dominance.
All is right in the hierarchy.
Hey!
