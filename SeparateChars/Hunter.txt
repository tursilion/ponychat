Yeah, It does look good as new!
And I have no idea what I'm doing.
My duties are keeping my busy.
I entrust you to lead the Coven Heads today.
Consider this a test.
Hmm.
Good.
You're all here.
Ugh!
I said wait!
Come back here!
Darius!
Eberwolf!
Why is everyone leaving?
We are scheduled to have a recruitment meeting.
Of course it is!
And this is no way to treat the emperor's-
But Belos says I don't need magic to serve the coven.
Wait.
What should I do?
How do I earn it?
I'll do it.
Look at all these potential recruits.
Sure, I've never actually spoken to witches my age.
Teens are probably into the same things as me!
Like authority and rules!
Classmate!
Ignore the fact that we've never met.
What if I told you all your dreams could come true?
And you'd just have to leave your home, friends, and family forever?
You think these are cool?
Not as cool as the Emperor's Coven.
I hear you get to sleep in till 6 a.
You!
How would you like to rise to the top by joining the Emperor's Coven?
You aren't?
What are you talking about?
Calm down, flea-magnet!
NICE- TO- UH- MEET- YOU!
Caleb?
Uh, Caleb!
I just transferred from uh... the... Toes?
But!
I'm not here to play Fly Dooby or... whatever that is.
Wait!
Do you really think your club will attract the best and the brightest?
Then maybe I'll give it a try.
How do we evaluate others?
A Witch's Duel?
A maze full of traps?
Leave everyone at the top of the mountain and see who makes it back to the bottom alive!
Classic.
Hmm.
I don't feel sick.
This girl will be a perfect candidate for the Emperor's Coven.
If there are more witches like her, we're set!
You said you'd find the best witches for this team.
But them?
They're pathetic.
Well, where I come from, even chances have to be earned.
Especially if you're considered half-a-witch like me.
Sorry, Captain.
Good luck with your match.
Those look complicated.
I thought you couldn't fly?
That's uh, cool, I guess.
I SAID IT WAS COOL!
Call Darius.
Darius, it's me!
Doesn't matter.
I've found some incredible recruits at Hexside.
I'm earning my place, just like you told me!
What was that?
I gotta go, but you'll meet them soon.
Gus, that was amazing!
You know, because... we're green, and there's... more to us... than you think.
I can't believe I almost bailed on you guys.
Today was amazing!
Thanks for giving me another shot.
We can forget all about that when we play next time as a part of the Emperor's Coven!
My name isn't Caleb.
It's Hunter!
And I'm the Emperor's right-hand man.
The Golden Guard!
Yes, I am!
Yeah, this would usually look cooler with the cloak, but I don't have it at the moment.
Long story.
Whoa there, scouts.
I didn't give you orders to come here.
Ah, okay.
Very good.
Then there won't be any delay in branding you with coven sigils and taking you away from your friends and family forever.
Hooray!
Okay, listen, I'm sorry about this whole cell thing, but did you really have to punch Steve, Skara?
Well, I don't get it.
You're joining the best coven there is.
You can keep all your magic, you get free room and board, you can even play Flyer Derby on your day off!
Well, this year's day has already passed, but next year's only 52 weeks away!
You will eventually.
Trust me, I'm your friend now.
Sure they do.
The Coven Heads do it all the time back at the castle.
Captain, you're on my side, right?
Darius, I did it!
I found recruits!
I can wear this proudly now.
Right?
They just have to go through basic training before becoming scouts.
It's not too bad.
Classic.
I think Hunter is too.
DARIUS!
I was mistaken.
These four are insolent agitators who aren't fit for the Emperor's Coven.
And I'm unfit to wear the sigil of the Golden Guard.
You can go.
Please, captain.
Are you gonna tell Belos about this?
They were, but then they heard Darius ordered me to protect you.
That Belos is evil?
Don't worry, I'm a-okay!
Don't you dare mention that thing around them.
Shh!
Listen, I don't know if I'm a witch, or a human.
All I know is that I'm a copy of someone Belos made, disappear.
So I shouldn't worry how they'd react, right?
If that's the case, have you told them about helping Philip?
Yeah, I overheard everything.
Don't tell them.
Please.
Sorry, man!
I didn't mean to hide, Emperor Belos.
Is it true that rain doesn't boil in the human realm?
The operation at the knee, why did you switch me out with Kikimora?
If this is punishment for failing my last mission, I swear I can do better!
Why do you keep following me?
I don't speak palisman.
Here's the plan, I slip in with this disguise, I find the Titan blood before Kiki, I give it to Belos, boom!
I'm useful again!
Ah another way in, we'll find another way in.
The Owl Lady and her dog, and is that the youngest Blight?
Alright, new plan.
What?
Hey, hey, AHHH!
Uh, yes, I am but a humble scout and I surrender.
Why does everyone say that?
Argh!
Hmph!
You can put down your staff, I won't run.
Ancient witches used to mine the veins for Titan blood-
Wait!
Don't-
This isn't a normal cave!
These walls are made from the veins of the Titan.
Any magic you shoot will bounce right back at you!
Those two are definitely gonna get us caught.
If I ever see that human again-
Well at least I'm not delusional enough to think I can turn into a harpy.
Yeah, listen to your rat.
We should create a distraction.
Huh, that was easy!
When they're caught, you and me can take the Titan blood for ourselves.
We might as well be.
The Owl Lady and her pet have nothing at stake unlike us.
Oof, that doesn't look good.
Seems clear to me.
Come back with results or else...
You can figure out the rest.
Has she told you that?
We have a lot in common, Blight.
We're both trying to show what we can bring to the table.
And we can't fail, 'cause there's nothing worse than disappointing someone who thinks you're special.
Hey!
Find a different perch, bird.
STOP!
That's Fool's blood, don't touch it.
Wait!
Take me with you!
At least untie me so I can escape!
Please, I don't want to be replaced.
I get to Eclipse Lake before anyone.
BYE!
Don't worry, I won't pick a fight, there's no Titan blood.
Hoho it's simple really, Belos needs Titan blood to make a new portal key.
Can't get to the human realm without it!
Since I failed my last mission I thought: Hey, a chance to make up for it!
 But I can't go back empty-handed!
Not again.
Long story short, this is my grave.
Want me to make you one too?
That's just life, rat.
Everyone has a use, and if you don't bye bye!
Your friend gets it.
Go find a better witch to be with.
Real staffs are weird!
You really wanna help?
Then give me that key!
Listen, you're strong, and I'm tired.
If this continues, you'll probably escape.
But here's the thing, we know where to find you, and your human.
So just hand over the key.
Appreciate it.
I uh- mean that, too.
Oh, hey!
You stuck with me the whole time, huh, bird?
I think I understood that!
I-Is that your name?
Can you say it again?
Hahahah, weird.
Can you say other things?
You know exactly where we are, human.
You got us trapped in the Emperor's MIND!
I don't know what those are, and I don't care too.
Remember what happened at the Night Market?
Halt!
For crimes ]
against the Emperor, you are under arrest!
For crimes against the Emperor, you are all under arrest!
Human?
No, no, no!
Stop!
I forbid you to flee!
Human!
Do you know what you've just done?
You want to prove that my uncle is evil?
And you thought I would help?
Eh, makes sense.
Mindscapes reflect the individual.
I've read a lot about this subject.
Whoa, look at this memory!
You know, unfettered wild magic wiped out our family.
Everyone knew too much and got themselves hurt.
That's why Belos took in the survivors, and dedicated his life to making the Coven System!
It's why he's so well liked!
Our sigils protect us from ourselves, and make the Titan happy.
This is when I inherited my staff!
You know, I'm the youngest scout to become Golden Guard.
I, uh, never found out what happened to the previous one.
Huh, why does Darius look so sad here?
Emperor, you're here!
We beg for your assistance to return to the physical world, so that I may capture your enemies!
And so she can ruin someone else's day.
Where are we now?
What do you mean the Emperor's real mind?
That gallery-
We're probably being punished because you provoked his inner self.
Oh, no!
Eyeballs!
You're so easy to scare.
Flapjack!
Are you okay?
Have they hurt you?
We'll be trapped!
Dragged down into his subconscious forever.
I told you I read about this stuff.
I'll be home soon, Flapjack.
Stay safe.
I love you.
Over and out.
What?
Belos has never done anything worthy of feeling guilt.
It's obviously his uh, sense of innocence.
His pure intentions!
What was that?
Wait!
You're just gonna invade his memories?
That's sacrilege!
See?
He's always been helping people.
That was probably a special technique to get people to listen to his message.
It's for the greater good.
What's the kid doing?
He was just perfecting sigil magic!
Besides, maybe, he's remembering things wrong.
Who knows how mindscapes work?
Well, maybe I'm an idiot!
You!
Get back here!
Of course.
I helped rebuild it.
We weren't running from the Inner Belos.
He was with us, the whole time.
What did you do to the other guards...
To our family?
It wasn't wild magic, was it?
He knows.
He... he knows we were in there.
I can't go back!
Of course not.
I want to help.
A-A-And if you told me how wild magic did this to you, I might be able to find a--
My apologies.
I spoke out of turn.
It won't happen again.
Luckily, some travelers picked me up out of the wreckage.
So I'm actually doing great.
Looks like you had a rough night though.
Palisman!
Sorry.
You shouldn't be here.
It'd be bad if Belos saw you.
I was not expecting that.
Wouldn't you like to know.
But rest assured, Gus, I--
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Okay, fine!
Truth is, my living situation has been compromised.
Maybe.
So I just need a place to crash.
Temporarily!
Hexside..
was the only place I could think of.
She's not with the Owl Lady?
Why are we here?
Whoa, Gus.
Wha... Is your eye okay?
Well, you're a witch... unspell it.
Well, if we're still in Hexside, we should find a teacher.
Maybe they'll know how to help.
I owed you.
For the food.
Are these real steps or illusion steps?
Real steps.
It was a good sandwich.
You don't say...
Oh Titan!
He's looking for me!
He'll know I'm here.
I-I g-gotta run.
I-I gotta hide!
That's not worth anything.
Stop acting foolish.
Is this... real?
Who are you?
That's not the captain.
Have you ever seen her play Flyer Derby?
There's no way she'd be afraid of me.
Belos... I command you to stop!
This is an illusion!
Gus!
Hunter.
I- I'm not with them, I swear!
I was with Gus the whole time.
I was trying to get him to you.
I'm not lying, Gus was showing me around.
T-There was a sandwich, he showed me this breathing thing.
Please, you gotta believe me!
Y-Yes!
Um, Graye said he'll be in the gym.
But he will be guarded.
But- how?
Gus!
Gus, can you hear me?
It's... hard, when you can't trust yourself.
I spent my whole life believing I was doing something good for someone good... but it was a lie.
And some part of me still wants to..
believe in that lie, just like you wanna believe you're dumb, or, whatever.
But it's not true.
I promise.
I wouldn't mess with you.
Uh, now, uh, how did that breathing thing go again?
What is..
this?
Is Graye gonna be alright?
Everyone in the castle is traveling to the head for the Day of Unity.
I... think I did.
Yes?
Listen.
Emperor Belos has been lying to everyone.
The Day of Unity isn't about the Titan or magic.
It's much scarier than that.
Sorry... there's a lot to explain.
I heard whispers of an attempt to invade the Emperor's mind with wild magic.
I decided to take the villains out myself.
I know you didn't want me going to Eclipse Lake.
But if I hadn't, I wouldn't have found this!
