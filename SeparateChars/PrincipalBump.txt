All aboard students!
No roughhousing!
Do not make me turn this carriage around!
Now, the Emperor's assistant will be your tour guide.
Please don't make me regret taking you here.
Hello, Bonesborough!
Students ask me all the time, Principal Bump, what's the height of magical achievement?
Wow.
I failed you as a principal.
[grabs the mic with some feedback]
It's being selected to join the best of the best.
And there are none better than the jewel of the coven system [three witches appear]
and the enforcers of His will, the Emperor's Coven.
Feast your eyes on this elite force, each member handpicked to help usher in a new age of controlled magic.
Members of the Emperor's Coven have access to all-- yes, all forms of magic.
Ooh.
Aah.
But...
only the best can ascend these ranks.
Some day that could be one of you!
And now, I'm pleased to introduce the esteemed leader of this coven and this year's mystery guest.
You know her, you love her!
Lilith!
[over intercom]
Attention Hexside students.
This is your principal speaking.
This year, I have the privilege to bestow our highest Grom honor to...
Amity Blight!
Our Grom queen!
Very good.
Lower the streamers, fill the punch bowl, and- how's my disco ball?
Great.
Just keep it up for 36 more hours.
Luz has lasted surprisingly long.
But what form will Grom take next?
Grom has escaped.
Good afternoon, students.
Hmm.
Abomination, rise.
Abomination, lie.
Oh, no, abomination.
How strange for it to get the command wrong.
I mean lie down.
[points to a desk]
So very lifelike.
[approaches the table with Willow]
When Miss Blight told me about your abomination, I had to come by, see what she's made of.
We were hoping...
[pulls a dagger out of his sleeve]
for a closer look.
Willow, I'll allow you the first cut.
Willow, go ahead and make the first incision.
No, the intruder won't get far.
[gasps]
Remarkable.
I can easily change that.
[magically shoves Eda over]
[moves his name plate back]
What are you doing here, Edalyn?
That's not a bad idea.
[walks over to a file cabinet]
I think the student body could learn a lot from having such an exchange student.
But before I even consider that, there's a lot to be answered for.
Oh, I'm not talking about Luz.
I'm talking about the necrotic experiments, the graffiti, the scams, the cheating, Miss Jenkinmeyer's teeth.
The trouble you caused when you were here, Eda.
There's the whiny rebel teen I remember.
You'll need this [hands her a mop]
to clean up all the hexed graffiti you left us.
Good luck.
[leaves]
Are you ready to give up?
[takes a ghost out of Eda's hair]
You've barely scratched the surface.
[grins and holds up a plunger]
[shakes Eda's hand]
It will be very exciting to have a real human exchange student.
Hexside School is safe for you both.
I'm the principal, not a stooge.
Consider your pupil our pupil.
[snaps]
[to Eda]
To think that any student of yours would be capable of doing anything but create chaos...
Eda, take your student and leave!
You are both banned from this campus!
If that's so, Augustus, would you be willing to accept her punishment as your own?
Very well.
[to Luz]
In light of that, barring any more trouble, you shall officially be enrolled in Hexside School next semester.
I didn't hear that.
[to Gus]
As for you, I would be saying detention right now but that seems to be out of order.
So, as of now, I'm removing you from the Human Appreciation Society.
[takes Gus's crown]
Impressive.
Still alive.
Yes, I suppose you are.
[throws the crown on Mattholomule's head]
Now, with that accomplished, Eda, we have some paperwork to fill out.
Right.
The human that wants to be a witch.
Against my better judgement, I've allowed you to take this exam into Hexside.
But can you even do magic with all your...
human parts?
Hmm?
Spells cast with paper?
I've never heard of such a thing.
[to himself]
But is it enough to pass the exam?
Believe it or not, I've seen worse.
Welcome, Luz, to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics!
[drops pamphlet on her head]
Take that, Glandus!
Looks like this year's Grudgby match is going to be a forfeit.
Absolutely not.
Now, today we'll be visited by the Emperor's Coven for a routine inspection.
If we want to impress them, you'll need to join a coven track before they arrive.
[laughs]
Studying multiple tracks at once?
No one does that.
[very serious]
No, you won't.
[holds up rule book with Emperor's Coven logo on it]
According to the rules, a good witch needs to hocus-focus.
You can only pick one of the nine tracks.
[points to the track banners above him]
And you do not want to embarrass me in front of the inspector.
Well there used to be, but...
[shudders]
Then I'll choose one for you.
[points to the track banners]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!
Ah, yes!
The Potions track.
You humans are filled with liquids, right?
I expect you to be on your best behavior.
[looks at a corkboard of with pictures of the results of Luz's previous visits to Hexside on it]
Based on the costly repairs from recent incidents, we could really use a donation from the Emperor's Coven.
Now, off to class.
The Choosy Hat!
It broke free.
Ahem!
This is the place where all troublemakers go.
[turns Luz's sleeves and leggings dark gray]
The detention track.
Yes.
Actual detention still needs...
repairs.
In the meantime, I am keeping all troublemakers far away from the eyes of the inspector.
You may try for a new track next year.
Maybe you'll do better in human school.
Welcome to Hexside, inspector.
Excellent.
Please come this way.
We've prepared a show with some of our finest students.
[politely applauds]
That was some real Hexside magic, huh?
Yes, yes-- wait what?
Is, uh, this part of the inspection?
[running between Amity and the inspector]
Amity, stay back.
She's an impostor!
Ugh.
Only 300 years until retirement.
Must find help.
Are in so much trouble.
Leaving your homeroom, mixing magic and-- is that a secret hideout?
I don't care to know the ins and outs of rascality.
[pulls out rule book]
But if the Emperor's Coven can send an actual inspector this time--
B-but-- [hugs rule book]
Alright, I'm smart enough to know when I've made a mistake.
Which tracks would you like to be in?
Then so be it.
[changes their uniforms to reflect their new tracks]
But if any of you cause more property damage, I'm feeding you to the choosy hat.
[to Luz]
And you?
You know, only one other student wanted to study every track.
[summons Lord Calamity's picture]
Unfortunately, she was never given the opportunity.
The coven denies knowing about the basilisk, but that won't stop me from writing a very stern letter.
You're not a teacher.
[going down the stairs]
What’s this?
Boscha got away with murder?
I can’t say I approve, but at least she’s trying new things.
[leaves]
She helped me love teaching again...
after she left.
