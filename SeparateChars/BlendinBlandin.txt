The mission is proceeding as planned.
Over.
My time-knee!
Oh, time-dang it!
Huh?
What just happened?
Oh man.
This is bad!
This is real bad!
Guys, we've got a situation!
AAAAAGH!
My position has been COMPROMISED!
Assuming stealth mode!
Color match!
Initiating color match!
Come on, dang it!
Uh, NO!
Who told you that?
MEMORY WIPE!
All right, you've cornered me.
I'm a time traveler.
That's kinda how it works.
Out of the question!
You know, this is sensitive extremely complicated time equipment.
You shut your time-mouth!
You don't believe me?
Guess where I was!
That's right!
15 years ago there was a costume shop right here!
One second.
Aw, heck!
Pat!
Pat down!
Blendin Blandin, Time Anomaly Removal Crew year twenty sñeventy-twelve.
My mission is to stop a series of time anomalies that are suppose to happen at this very location!
But-but I don't see any anomalies!
I don't know if it's some kind of paradox, or I'm just really tired...
You know what?
What the heck!
I'm worth it!
But I've got my eye on you!
Ehhh, ehhh, One please.
Guard it with your life.
Woooooo!
Yaaaaaaayyy!
Weeheee!
YOU TWO!
Do you have any idea, how many rules you just broke?
I'm asking, I wasn't there with you, it was probably a lot, right?
AAAAGH!
The Time Paradox Avoidment Enforcement Squadron!
It was those kids!
And their leader, Waddles!
I'll get you for this!
I'll go back in time and make sure your parents never MEET!
I beg your mercy, Time Baby!
Ta tum, ta tee ta tum!
What are you looking at?
Through me, Oh, uh, Sorry, C-come on, Through me!
And that's, what it would be like if I'd just, gotten it right the very first chance, but it's still as effective.
It's Blendin! Blendin Blenjamin Blandin!
How could you not know my name after you ruined my life?
Initiate flashback!
It was after you stole my time device to win your stupid pig!
I was cast out of the Time Anomaly Removal Crew, my whole life's purpose.
And then I was given ten squared life sentences in time prison.
I spent every day since then planning my vengeance.
And now finally, it has come!
What?
You think some dumb birthday matters right now?
Do you know where you are?
Welcome, to Globnar!
It's gladiatorial time combat!
The winner gets a precious Time Wish, and then decides the loser's fate!
And the two of you are officially challenged.
Dundgren!
Get me my war-paint.
Yeah, neon green is good, this is a good color for me.
It's fierce...  Who?
What?
You can't let them escape!
Stop them!
I don't see them.
You better find those kids!
I'm gonna keep stammering until you find them!
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I...
Th-this way!
They've gotta be around here somewhere.
I-I-I think I heard them!
Man, the sooner I defeat those kids in Globnar, the sooner I can win my time wish.
Naing Niang Niang Niang Niang, with the kids!
Don't you know a time wish can do literally anything?
Any impossible problem solved just like that?
I mean, imagine the possibilities.
It's them!
Yes!
Let the Globnar begin!
Prepare, for, GLOBNAAA...
Get ready, kids.
When I get that time wish, you'll wish you were never born.
Or rather, you'll wish you were born, because I'm gonna wish you were never born!
Oh-oh, yeah?
Well I have training!
What do you think I did in prison all that time?
Yes!
Blendin for the almost-win!
Oh, I know it doesn't seem that challenging now, but just wait till they turn on that fog machine.
You'll be done for!
You just wait until ya, Aw, man.
Nooooo!
Oh, jeez, Wh-what?
You'd do that for me?
I got my job back!
I feel like hugging somebody.
Yes, sir.
And that's not all.
Behold your time wish!
The power to alter time paradox free in any way you choose.
Are you kidding me?
Do you have any idea what you’ve just wasted?
Do you how many have died to get the time wish; the wars that were started?
Okay, yeah.
Phew.
That’s a good time wish!
My body is a temple!
How dare you!
Aw, man, this has gone from bad to worse!
I gotta get out of time-Dodge!
