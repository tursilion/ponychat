Wow.
Daddy!
Let go!
...Hurt, or stepped on, or even get lost.
At all times, I know.
And if I see any strangers, don't talk to them.
Come straight home.
Okay, okay.
Can I go now?
Please?
Yes, mom.
Really?
How come?
But Dad, I...
Dad...
Hey!
Wait!
Come back!
I just wanna play!
Ahhh... the mighty hunter has cornered her prey.
Errrrh!
Whoah... cool!
The Outlands!
I wonder what's out there...
But... but...
B-but...
Nnngh!
Timon... would someone please just listen to me?
I'm not just a princess, you know.
That's only half of who I am!
Uh... well, I, uh...
um... Eww!
Gross!
My father says to never turn your back on an Outsider!
Really?
Cool!
Aaaaahhh!
Run!
This way!
Yeah... 
Hey... what about me?
Look out!
Move it!
I did it... I did it!
Whoah, man -- did you see the size of those teeth?
They were goin' Rrrarrarrarr ....
He was just totally eatin' you up right there, and I jumped on his head -- and I bopped him so good...
We make such a good team!
And you... you were really brave!
I'm Kiara.
Tag!
You're it!
Tag!
You're it!
You're it!
Hello?
You run, I tag... get it?
What's the matter?
Don't you know how to play?
Bye... 
But Daddy, I -- I didn't mean to disobey...
I know... Circle of Life.
I know.
But what if I don't wanna be Queen?
It's no fun.
If there's so much I must be can I still just be me, the way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart, or am I just one part of some big plan?
Daddy... you have to promise to let me do this on my own.
Promise?
Timon... what are you doing here?
My father sent you.
I -- but he promised to let me do this on my own; he lied!
I should have known he'd never give me a real chance.
I'll do this on my own.
Away from the Pride Lands!
Where am I?
The Pride Lands... why did you bring me here?
Who do you think you are?
Look!
I had everything under control!
Then move downwind.
Kovu?
Father... how could you break your promise?
But I was doing just fine!
Even before Kovu...
Hey... uh, thanks for saving me today.
What?
Oh... and I suppose you could teach me?
Coming!
All right -- impress me.
We start at dawn.
G'morning!
I'm ready for my first lesson.
Surprised ya, huh?
Hey, c'mon.
Let's go!
Gotcha!
You could hear me... huh?
Timon!
What are you doing here?
Like this.
Training?
This is just for fun!
Uh-oh.
Um... s-sorr -- uh... What?
Oh yeah!
Um -- look... there's one that looks like a baby rabbit.
See the fluffy tail?
Really?
My father and I used to do this all the time.
He says all the great Kings of the past are up there.
My father said there was a... a darkness in Scar that he couldn't escape.
What's wrong?
Kovu... Kovu -- wait.
Uh... friend of the family.
Kovu, c'mon!
Where is it?
Upendi -- it means love, doesn't it?
Upendi!
Good night.
Father... Father!
Zazu, get help!
Father... No... 
Daddy... it can't be true.
Kovu!
Daddy, please... listen to him!
...Kovu!
Father... please reconsider!
That's not... he loves me... for me!
You don't know him!
You will never be Mufasa!
Kovu?
Kovu...
Kovu...
In a perfect world, one we've never known, we would never need to face the world alone.
They can have the world, we'll create our own.
I may not be brave or strong or smart but somewhere in my secret heart I know: love will find a way.
Anywhere I go I'm home, if you are there beside me.
Like dark turning into day: somehow we'll come through.
Now that I've found you love will find a way.
Kovu... we have to go back.
Our place is with our pride.
If we run away, they'll be divided forever.
Daddy, this has to stop.
A wise King once told me, We are one.
I didn't understand what he meant... now I do.
No... Look at them... they are us.
What differences do you see?
Aren't we all part of the Circle of Life?
Zira!
Give me your paw!
Zira, come on... I'll help you...
Daddy.
Kovu...
