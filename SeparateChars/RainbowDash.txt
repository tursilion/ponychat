Uh, 'scuse me?
Lemme help you.
Oops, I guess I overdid it.
Um, uh, how about this?
My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry!
No no.
Don't thank me.
You're quite welcome.
The one and only.
Why, you heard of me?
Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap.
I'll do it in a jiffy.
Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
The Wonderbolts!
They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
Yep!
That's them!
Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
Loop-de-loop around, and wham!
What'd I say?
Ten. Seconds. Flat.
I'd never leave Ponyville hanging.
You should see the look on your face.
You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle.
I can't wait to hang out some more.
What did you do with our Princess?
Come back here!
Nighttime?
Forever?
Where's she going?
And just what are the Elements of Harmony?
And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh?
Are you a spy?
Whoa!
Nopony knows.
You know why?
'cause everypony who's ever come in has never come out!
Fluttershy!
Quick!
And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh, me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM!
Caught you right in the nick of time.
I'm on it.
Right here, guh, Then what is?
Oh, give me a break.
So would the mustache.
What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
Duh.
Who's there?
I ain't scared of you!
Show yourself!
Who?
Really?
I mean, Oh yeah, me.
Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya?
'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever.
Yep.
Yes.
Yes, it's all true.
WOOHOO!
Sign me up.
Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
You, Thank you!
For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
Where's the sixth?
Ugh, my head.
Aw yeah.
Whoa!
Ugh.
Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?
No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
YES!
This is so awesome.
The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping Gala every year.
I can see it now.
Everyone would be watching the sky.
Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!
I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash.
And for my grand finale, the Buccaneer Blaze!
The ponies would go wild!
The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member.
Don't you see, Twilight?
This could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff.
You gotta take me!
That doesn't mean you own it.
A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?
Living the dream.
Wait just a minute.
I mean, yes.
I mean, maybe.
Look, it doesn't matter.
I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.
Your ticket?
Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had.
Enjoying the sunny weather?
Whaddya mean?
I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
No no no, of course not.
Seriously, I'd do it for anypony.
Heh heh, eh.
Ugh, fine.
Yes!
That means the ticket is mine.
Ha ha, I got the ticket, I got the ticket, 
you know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for the Wonderbolts anyway.
I don't need that ticket either.
What a great way to apologize.
STAMPEDE!
Look there!
Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
But she'll be here for sure.
Applejack is never late.
Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there?
What an athlete.
This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.
Tired?
There you are.
See this contraption?
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own.
Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
Ready?
One, two, THREE!
Umm, maybe I wasn't clear.
You're supposed to land on the other end.
Applejack, what the hay is going on?
I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
Ugh!
Wait, Applejaaaaack!
I think somepony else needs your help.
Yep.
STAMPEDE!
Phew!
That applebucking sure made me hungry.
Pinkie Pie?
Not again.
Not now, Pinkie Pie.
I'm in the middle of something.
I said not now...
Phew.
That was close.
Waaa, oh, forget it.
Okay.
Pinkie Pie!
I can think of one thing.
I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.
You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought.
You wanna hang out?
A simple nod would do.
Is she even home?
There she is.
Fluttershy.
Yeah, you're right.
Huh.
We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff.
So, who's it gonna be?
Oh, awesome.
Who?
Who?
Do I know them?
Good one, Pinkie Pie.
Ridiculous.
Mornin', Pinks.
Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.
Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.
She's half-eagle, half-lion.
Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp.
Hey, remember the chant?
Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you?
Gilda just got here.
We'll catch up with you later.
Yeah, only faster.
So now what?
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
A race?
You are so on.
I win.
No way.
Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you.
Oh Geez, dream on.
There is no way you beat me.
Hah, see?
Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.
New moves?
Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while.
Try matching that.
Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?
That was sweet.
Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here.
Shouldn't take long.
Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
Later.
Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer.
You are a scream.
Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
G, the punch.
Priceless.
Hey G, look, presents.
Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
Come on then, let's have some cake.
You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself.
You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends.
If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.
Not cool.
I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here.
I didn't know how rude she was.
And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
I'd rather hang out with you.
No hard feelings?
Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us.
Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic.
Boo!
So, Great and Powerful Trixie.
What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?
There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
That's my job!
They don't call me Rainbow and Dash for nothin'!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-a-a-a!
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Yeah!
A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
It's fine.
Unbelievable!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Magic's got nothing to do with it.
Trixie's just a loudmouth.
And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder.
Uh-huh.
Don't be such a scaredy-pony.
It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder.
Three forty six, three forty seven... Three hundred fifty four, Three hundred fifty five, no, wait...
Pinkie Pie!
Now I have to start over.
I'll tell you what we're meant to do.
Give him the boot.
Take that.
And that!
Okay, girls, you heard her.
The fate of Equestria is in our hooves.
Do we have what it takes?
Raaah!
You bet it is.
The higher you go, the chillier it gets.
Heh, oh yeah.
That'll keep you nice and cozy.
Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along?
I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow.
She's just going to slow us down.
Whoa.
What was that?
Well, it is a mountain.
I'm going to fly up there and check it out!
Wah!
Oh, all right.
Hey!
What are you waiting for?
An invitation?
Well, it is a cliff.
You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?
Ugh.
Around the mountain?
That's going to take them forever.
Told you it was going to take them forever.
Ugh.
Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
Not your fault.
Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, great.
She's scared of caves now, too.
Oh come on!
We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
Ugh.
I'm not!
So much for persuading him.
All right, that's it.
We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does.
It's time to stop wasting time!
I'm going in!
Get!
Out!
Heh.
Sorry.
Who-o-o-o-o-a!
Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...
Dragon!
Why are you laughing?
That awful dragon is back!
Pinkie Pie, you scared me!
I mean, uh, you, broke my concentration.
Sinister.
And the clouds move, all by themselves!
Here we go...
Well, Once a month, she comes into Ponyville.
W-what about digging at the ground?
You've got to admit that's weird.
And Zecora's still out there.
Yeah, back at ya, Zecora!
You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!
Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself.
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?
She's trying to say-ow! 
Zecora slapped us all with a curse!
I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
I don't care what you say, Twilight.
It's time to pony up and confront Zecora.
Come on, girls.
Are you with me?
How about you, Applejack?
Applejack?
Rarity's hair!
I bet they went after Zecora.
Hey, a little help here?
Hey, wait for me!
Ex-CUSE me?
What the, Aaah!
Ahh!
You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.
Okay, fine.
But what about the cauldron?
Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy!
This is waaay too boring for me.
Ugh, sooo boooring.
What's that sound, Twilight?
Wow, what are they?
Uh, I'll take one.
Huh?
Huh?
Get off me!
Waaa!
Ditto!
Guh.
Yeah!
We can drive 'em back into the forest.
Aye aye.
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
All right!
We call in the weather patrol.
Time to take out the adorable trash.
YAAAAAA!
I can't hold it!
She's breaking up.
Heh.
Hey, it worked.
They're not eating the food anymore.
YAAAA!
They're not that adorable.
Some sort of infestation.
All right team, you're clear for takeoff.
Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?
Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
Um, Sorry, Twilight.
Got it.
Got it.
Okay.
Ugh!
Make up your minds!
Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.
Oh that featherbrain.
Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head.
Let me do something about that.
What's the matter, kid?
Cutie mark?
I can get you a cutie mark like that!
Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark?
I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry.
It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.
That's right, stretch out those legs.
Gotta be nice and loose.
The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible.
One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark.
Are you ready?
I said: Are!
You!
Ready!
Juggling, go!
Hang-gliding, go!
Karate, go!
Kite-flying, go!
Ultrapony Roller Derby, go!
Tried that one, tried that one, tried that one, Tried that one, tried that one...
Eating cupcakes?
Whoo-hoo!
Oh yeah?
Think you can do better, cowgirl?
Heh!
Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse.
The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
Yeah, yeah.
I still have the closest throw, Applesmack.
Just try and beat it.
I lost.
I hate losing.
All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?
So let's prove it.
I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition.
A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.
Iron Pony competition.
The most athletic pony ever!
I don't know.
Why is she here?
Right, heh.
Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books.
Thanks, but I couldn't have been as fast as you.
Oh, I can't believe I won.
Ugh.
Ready for another pony ride?
Does this count?
I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
Whoo-hoo!
I win by a landslide, or mudslide in your case.
I am the Iron Pony!
What?
Sounds like sour apples to me.
But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
I still would have won even without my wings.
Gladly.
How?
Heh!
Easy shmeasy.
No wings?
No problem.
Pardon me, excuse me.
Make way for the Iron Pony.
So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?
Yeah, yeah, I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
Very funny.
Good one, Twilight.
What?
You're not an athlete, you're a, well, you're an egghead.
Egghead.
What'd you read, The Egghead's Guide to Running?
Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up?
Get it?
Eye muscles.
Yeah.
See you at the finish line, Tomorrow.
Come on, Rainbow.
Show 'em a little dash.
You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?
Not so fast, Applejack!
This race isn't over yet!
Whoa!
Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.
Oh, I see.
A big cheater is what I see.
Sure it was.
I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.
Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.
Look, ma, no wings.
Nice one, Rainbow.
Aaa!
I'm sure I'll win now.
Oh horse apples...
See ya!
What the hay?
You said no flying!
Aaa!
Whoa!
You know, I think Twilight's right.
Yeah!
If you wanna beat me, you better, RUUUN!
No, you cut it out!
And now I'm gonna finish it.
Oh yes, I will.
That's it!
All bets are off!
I won!
I won!
Then who won?
You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.
I don't believe it.
Twilight beat us.
We weren't very good sports.
I'd love to stretch my legs.
Look out below!
Sorry.
New trick.
Didn't quite work.
Outfit for the what now?
Oh, I love fun things!
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
What?
No, I just want my dress to be cool.
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
The shape's fine, just make the whole thing, you know, cooler.
It needs to be about twenty percent cooler.
It's cool!
That's so cool!
You think we overdid it?
She kind of is.
That's your answer for everything!
Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
Now, what have we learned?
Good.
Yes, and most importantly?
Right!
So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.
, Ugh.
You're gonna cheer for me like that?
Louder.
Louder!
Louder!
And now, phase one of my routine.
Phase two.
Here we go.
Phase three.
The sonic rainboom.
C'mon!
Uh-oh.
Hehe.
Sorry about that ladies.
That was a truly feeble performance.
Ugh.
I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours.
That feeble cheering!
I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
Yeah.
I wish you guys could be there.
Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
It was a long time ago, I was just a filly.
Are you kidding?
I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale!
I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts.
A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes, It'll be a dream come true!
I'm gonna go rest up.
Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know.
Hehe.
You, on the other hand, better keep practicing.
I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy.
Don't be afraid to speak up.
I didn't get kicked out.
Those guys are right.
I'll never be able to do it.
Aaaaaah!
What do I do?
Everypony's gonna see me fail!
The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join.
Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest!
My life is ruined!
Rare?
The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!
Rarity!
Are you, flying?
I, I can't believe it!
This is so cool!
You guys made it!
Wait!
How'd you do that?
Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous.
But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here.
Hey, we've got some time before the competition.
Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?
Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!
Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
Great idea!
C'mon, girls.
To the weather factory!
This is where they make the snowflakes.
Each one is hoofmade.
As you can see, it's a delicate operation.
We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
And here's where they make the rainbows!
Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
Rarity!
What're you doing talking to these guys?
Oohh, Are you kidding?
I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings.
I'm doomed!
Of course!
Why wouldn't I be okay?
Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
WHAT?
What am I gonna DO?
I'll never win the competition now...
Eyah!
Umm, She's talking to you!
Uhh, What am I gonna do?
C'mon, Rainbow Dash.
You can do this.
Just remember the routine.
Phase one.
Oof.
Waaah!
Time for phase two.
Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around.
Phase three.
rainboom.
Wings, don't fail me now!
Hold on, Rarity!
I'm coming!
Whoa.
I did it.
I did it!
Oh yeah.
I did that too.
Ha, best day ever!
Aw, it's okay.
Everything turned out all right, right?
I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!
This really is the best day ever!
Heh, thanks, guys.
Aww, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Sorry, boys, But I've got plans!
Yeah.
'Cause all you said earlier was, Yuck!
Ugh!
We'll see about that.
Get 'em!
Come on!
Twilight!
That could take forever!
There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
She must be in there.
Let's go!
Heh.
I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
Oh man, we're going fast!
This is so exciting, I can't even wait!
Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
Ghk, Psst!
Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?
If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?
When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?
No, Fluttershy.
I do not think she's a tree!
I was just?
Well.. Yes.
But not exactly?
Hmm, Something tells me this isn't a circus act.
Hey there!
Where ya headed in such a hurry?
Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so, bulky.
No offense.
I just wanna know?
Hey!
I'm talking to you?
I got you now, you?
Dragon-napping Spike.
I'll show her!
Ow, Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo...
Hnnh, Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
Yah! Pinkie Pie!
Shhshh!
What do you think you're doing?
You gotta get out of here!
You're gonna blow my cover.
I'm trying to save Spike!
And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting, caught.
Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off.
Save yourself!
Ugh, Huh.
Well, I still don't trust them.
I say we turn tail and bail while we still?
You!
That's it!
We are outta here!
Yeah, right.
Hmph...
Huh, I'll say they had a good reason!
C'mon.
We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!
We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
The land is theirs!
You planted the trees not knowing that.
Honest mistake.
Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
Plant the trees somewhere else!
The buffalo had it first!
Come on, Applejack!
I put my hoof down!
I know you don't want to do this.
I don't know, but it's never too late to think of something.
Come on, think!
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!
He's not gonna do it!
So, what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?
Is the pay good?
Hellooo?
Anybody home?
Wah-wah!
Ooh, you're good.
Too good.
I'm bored.
What are you two doing?
Are you having a race?
Oh, can I play?
One, two, three, go!
Hey, you know what you should do?
You should go over there and tickle them!
Yeah!
I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.
It all happened during the race at Flight Camp... where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor.
I've never flown like that before!
That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt!
The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane, I liked it, a lot!
Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast, was winning!
Most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale.
But that day, The day I discovered racing, I proved that the legends were true.
I made the impossible happen!
And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.
Whoa!
Wow, Twilight!
You're lucky to have such a rad assistant.
I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.
Oh yeah, pipsqueak?
How about taking out the trash?
He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
Nice one!
Now, let me show you how it's really done.
Hey, Pinkie Pie!
Me neither.
When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there!
Ta-da!
What kind of surprises?
See ya later, birthday alligator!
This afternoon?
Oh, man!
We'd love to, but, we're, house-sitting this afternoon.
Uh, look at the time!
We'd really better get going.
Harry.
Yeah, I don't think you know him.
Yup!
He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon.
But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house.
A-at the beach!
Yup!
Gotta go!
Hi, Pinkie Pie!
Uh-oh!
We have a problem!
You heard her!
Hey there, Pinkie Pie!
Sorry I was in such a rush earlier.
Had some place to be and couldn't slow down and say, Hello.
You know how it goes.
Yeah... so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?
Uh, Pinkie Pie?
Aaallrighty.
What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...
You should really just come with me.
Who you calling a chump, chump?
Ugh, That's it.
Party's over.
Come on, Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie, let's go!
Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?
We'll do this the hard way!
We're, here, Uh, yeah!
Because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
Uh-huh!
It sure would.
I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
You don't wanna know.
For Gummy, yeah!
For what?
Sure thing, Spike.
Uh, I-I don't know, Spike.
To prove!
Hey, no prob.
Hay yeah!
Name's Rainbow Dash.
Sure.
Why not?
I'm, hanging, with the, Wonderbolts!
Hey, Spitfire!
You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?
You ever soared past lightning?
It's awesome!
This isn't hanging out.
If it's the last thing I do...
Come on, Rainbow!
If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.
This is my chance!
Yes!
Whoa!
Yeah!
Hanging out with friends!
Come back here, you!
Gotcha!
Eww, what is this?
Cotton candy?
Wait a second!
It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow.
You can't just?
You did.
Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!
There's crazy weather all over Equestria!
Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now!
But don't worry.
I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
Alright, Princess!
Hey!
Nopony insults the Princess!
That's right!
I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
Nope!
Dopey Discord forgot about these babies!
I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time.
My wings!
The first rule?
Yeah!
Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!
Moving out!
I've got you now, element.
Get off there and put 'em up!
Come on!
Let's go!
I've got a message for you too!
Cloudsdale?
Crumble, without me?
Hey, guys!
That's nice.
Pfft.
Loyalty, schmoyalty!
Have you guys seen Ponyville?
It's a disaster!
I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
Nice try!
Ponyville's your problem, not mine.
Lemme go!
I don't need you guys!
Leave me alone!
Wh-what happened?
How's Ponyville?
Where are the Elements?
Did we stop Discord?
Uh, what are you talking about?
I don't have any issues with Applejack.
Because she asked me to.
Right, Applejack?
You got it, boss!
Canterlot?
Wait!
But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
Lighten up, old-timer.
This is the best night of the year for pranks!
It's all in good fun.
There's another group over there!
Ha-ha!
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
Whoa!
Who?
Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious.
C'mon, try and keep up!
Winona?
I mean, Winona's head?
Um, is this weird, or is it just me?
Angel?
Gummy?
Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town.
Yaaaaah!
Whaa!
Phew.
What are you all doing out here?
Uh, you do?
Oh, I'm not mad.
You all are right.
Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?
Hey, now wait a minute!
Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!
Sky is good.
I'd like it to fly.
Pass.
Otters and seals do not fly.
That's it.
I'm outta here.
Bigger.
And cooler.
It's just a squirrel.
...Yeah.
Ya think?
Better, but cooler.
Now you're talking!
But instead of just one standout, now that's too many.
And may the best pet win!
Shh!
You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya?
Well, we'll just see about that!
If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers.
This competition isn't for the weak.
You'd better be prepared to step up your game!
You call that flapping?
That's better.
There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme!
Any questions?
Seriously, Fluttershy!
The turtle?
What did you bring that thing here for?
Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up.
Look at him!
But?
Grrgh, ugh, fine!
But don't say I didn't warn you!
This isn't a game, you know!
Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet.
Speed.
Agility.
Guts.
Style.
Coolness.
Awesomeness.
And radicalness.
You would think that, Twilight.
And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
Speed!
Yeah!
That's speed!
Tsk-tsk.
That's just sad.
Agility!
Wanna know the opposite of agility?
Yeah, baby, now that's what I call agility!
Don't leave me hangin'!
I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
Okay!
Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
Now that takes guts!
Style!
Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!
Coolness!
Sorta cool.
Not cool.
Pretty cool.
Could be cooler.
Not what I had in mind.
I can't hear you!
Eugh.
Now that's a cool sound!
Sorta awesome.
Not awesome.
Could be more awesome.
Ho ho ho, yeah, that is awesome!
Uh, you did that already.
That's pretty much all you can do, huh?
Whoa!
That was truly awesome!
But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.
Listen, turtle... Whatever!
You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.
You didn't.
I mean, 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home.
You're starting to creep me out.
So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one.
So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be, pause for dramatic effect, a race against, ME!
Through Ghastly Gorge!
Dun dun dun!
Gesundheit.
Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary.
It's fun.
Heh.
I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack.
But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet!
Ready?
Setgo!
Woo-hoo!
Haha!
Try to keep up!
Can't catch me, ha-ha!
C'mon, slowpokes!
You wanna win, don't ya?
I forgot to tell you!
Watch out for the Quarray eels!
They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this.
Whoa.
Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy!
Right, guys?
AVALANCHE!
Hey!
Whoaaaa!
C'mon, Wait!
Come back!
Don't leave me!
I'm the one who's supposed to win!
I don't wanna end up stuck here, forever!
Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening.
Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge.
I mean, it's like, forever!
Somepony!
Anypony!
Help me!
Wahoo!
My prayers have been answered!
Oh, thankyouthankyoutha?
You?
Oh no!
Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world!
Gyh, I'm doomed.
DOOMED, I tell you!
Just my pride.
Uh, thanks.
What you did, I owe you one.
Oh, Right, Yeah, That.
Easy, fella.
Nothing to be afraid of.
The falcon sure does looks cool, He's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet.
But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help.
The tortoise!
Spike, take a letter.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Today I learned what the most important quality really is.
A certain kind of spirit.
A stick-to-it-ive-ness.
A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner.
And this tortoise has it.
Gesundheit.
You just can't stop that little guy.
He's like a, like a, Tank!
Hmm, Heh.
C'mon, Tank!
We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!
What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
What a beautiful day.
There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
Looks like my sky swim will have to wait!
I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!
Wow.
What's with this crowd?
Uh, thanks, everypony.
It was really no big deal.
Oh no!
There's something wrong with the baby!
She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!
I can't hear you!
And then I zoomed into the well.
I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me.
Danger's my middle name.
Rainbow 'Danger' Dash.
Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
Hey, Applejack.
How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?
Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies.
But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write.
That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.
Spike here writes down everything I say.
Don't you, Spike?
This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform.
Yep, it takes guts.
But it also takes brains.
And sometimes a big lunch and a nap.
Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.
There you go.
Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
Yeah, yeah.
I've got a good ten seconds to spare.
Just a couple more.
Mare Do Well, huh?
Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way!
Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow?
Ugh, fine!
Picky, picky.
Whoaaaa!
Aah!
I can't believe it.
Mare Do Well is stronger than me?
Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.
Huh?
Never fear, your friendly neighbor?
Whoa!
Never fear?
I'm coming!
Hold on!
Whoa!
Here ya go, safe and sound.
Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow?
You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.
Okay.
She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time.
I've gotta step up my game.
If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded!
Looks like Ponyville needs a hero!
Easy peasy.
My game is officially back on.
If only somepony were here to pat me on the back.
Eh, guess I'll have do it myself?
Help!
Help!
You?
I suppose you want me to thank?
You gotta be kidding me...
Lemme get this straight.
She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic?
Ughhh!
How do I compete with that?
Wait a minute.
I do have a leg up on her.
And that leg is, wings!
Hah!
Take that, Mare Do Well!
Oh, for the love of Pete.
I don't have to admire that!
I don't think she's all that great!
I didn't say that.
Who, me?
Don't write that, Spike!
Fine!
Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good?
no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!
Huh, no sign of trouble here.
Darn it.
Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill.
Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?
Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere!
How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?
Hold it right there, Granny Smith!
You don't have to pretend with me.
I can see that you're in way over your head here.
You're putting on a brave face, I get it.
But you don't have to anymore.
I'll help you cross the street!
Don't worry!
You're in extremely, capable, hooves!
Here we are!
Safe and sound.
A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?
Somepony's in trouble!
You'd better let me handle this, ma'am!
For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!
Ta-da!
How would you describe what I just did?
Would you say I was amazing?
Please, just answer the question!
Was I, or was I not, amazing?
Oh, look!
Another great feat of heroism!
I have just saved that grass!
From weeds!
Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
Aww, who am I kidding?
All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that!
What about me?
How could everypony forget about me so easily?
I mean, have I changed?
Same sleek body.
Same flowing mane.
Same spectacular hooves.
Nope, I'm still awesome.
They're wrong.
But, then, why am I all alone?
I hate being all alone.
I knew it!
No need to apologize, squirt.
Anypony could make that mistake.
Wait a minute.
Why are you here?
No way!
Can't you see I-I wanna be alone?
I love being alone.
Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her.
Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e?
Hey, squirt!
Wait up!
The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?
So what are you hiding?
Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
What the hay?
Grrr, I got you now!
Alright, Miss Mysterious!
Mystery, solved!
P-p-p-p- Pinkie?
Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?
Twilight?
Applejack?
There were three of you?
I don't understand.
Why?
Don't you want me to be a hero?
Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.
Okay, a lot.
Ohhhh.
That makes loads more sense.
Yeah.
You're right.
And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me.
Like Mare Do Well.
That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.
Okay, let's hear it.
Look out!
It's a real ghost!
How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?
Duh, the one in your mouth!
Hey, wait up!
We're your friends!
I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too!
C'mon, you guys!
Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!
Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
Huh?
Don't tell me!
You-you tied yourselves up?
Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
Put her down, right now!
I mean it, dragon boy!
Drop her, scaly!
Look!
The Wonderbolts!
On it!
All in a day's work.
I can hardly wait!
Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day.
I spy a snowpony!
Aaah!
Rain-bow-Dash!
Rain-bow-Dash!
Aaaah!
Thank you, thank you!
Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'!
I'm the star!
All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!
For the hundredth time, it's not us!
We're not making it snow!
It must be the unicorns!
They're doing it with their freaky magic!
What a shocker.
An Earth pony with no ideas.
You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!
Well, I'm leaving first!
Atten-tion!
Well?
Aren't you curious about how it went?
Horribly!
Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful!
Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed?
We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!
C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on!
Hup-one, hup-two!
Get a hold of yourself, Private!
We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand.
To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!
You never know where enemies might be lurking.
A-ha!
What's that?
Okay.
This is getting old.
This is the new land we've been searching for!
I proclaim this new land to be, Pegasopolis!
I planted my flag first!
Did too!
The name is Pegasopolis!
Pegasopolis!
I say we fight for the land.
May the best pony win!
I'll have you court-martialed for insubordination, Private!
We settle this on the battlefield!
Oh no.
Not again.
It's Commander Hurricane.
You mean like this, your highness?
Private?
Outline our territory for everypony to see.
See this real, non-invisible line?
No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it!
This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!
What are you doing?
Don't go around the rock, go over it!
I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!
I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!
Hey!
You invaded our territory!
That's the last straw!
Great.
Now there's no way out!
We're trapped!
You've been fighting too, your Highness.
That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win!
Earth ponies are numbskulls!
Why do I always have to do all the high up chores?
Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
Y'know what?
I got it.
Aw, yeah!
Heh, just you wait!
Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon.
Gotta dash!
Huh?
Now, careful, Derpy!
Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done.
Yeah.
It's a mystery.
Nothing!
In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!
Seeya in a week!
Well, that is the point.
What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?
She loves Ponyville!
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's go find her!
I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end.
I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?
Change of scenery?
What's that supposed to mean?
Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!
Twilight's right.
We gotta get her to spill the beans.
Fine!
Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
Really?
Did you see Wild Bull Hickok?
What about Calamity Mane?
Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
It's time to call in the big guns.
The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!
Tomorrow, huh?
I don't know, Yeah, maybe.
Pull over!
Come on, Fluttershy!
No time!
They knew what they were getting into!
Not so fast!
But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
And we're your friends!
We don't care if you came in fiftieth place!
You're still number one in our books.
Darn it!
Now you got me acting all sappy!
C'mon, Fluttershy!
Cider season's about to start!
The rush?
Don't you remember what happened last year?
Or the year before that?
Or pretty much any cider season ever?
Pinkie Pie.
She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!
Well, not this year!
This year I'm gonna get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want and laugh when she doesn't get any!
It's the perfect plan.
Y'know, I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of her?
Who are all these ponies?
Surprise, surprise.
You ran out again!
Why can't you make enough cider for all of us?
Or at least for me!
I doubt that.
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Is this some kind of cruel joke?
Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
In my sleep!
We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
Applejack, help me!
All right then, double time!
I ought to press you into jerk cider!
Awwww.
Huh, how long do I need to lie here?
I've got things I need to do!
You guys have gotta get me out of here!
I'm gonna climb the walls!
Few days?
Might as well be a few months, or a few years!
What's this?
'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
No thanks.
I so don't read.
I'm a world-class athlete.
Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight.
Heh, no offense, but I am not reading.
It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
Get it?
Never mind...
As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step.
If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky.
But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days.
Few days, it might as well be a few months, or a few years!
Huh.
I'm right there with you, sister.
The mosquitoes buzzed loudly.
The macaws cried from the high trees.
Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step.
Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe.
She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!
I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but, I love this story!
I, I, I love reading!
I'm an egghead.
The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple.
Uh, hey, guys...
No no, you first.
Aw, shucks, you, rained on my cumulus, heh.
Go again!
Whoa, you found my seagull.
You zapped my weather pony!
Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee.
Oh, my thunderbolt.
Aw, and that's my last cloud.
You found it.
Guess you guys win, I lose.
You win some, you lose some.
Thanks for coming!
Who said anything about Daring Do?
I told you I'm not interested in reading.
It's nap time for me!
Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber.
At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!
Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but?
Oh, just in time.
I am sooo hungry.
'You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.
Whoa!
Who is this dude?
oh, good evening?
morning.
Doc.
Uh, of course not.
What?
Later today?
Right now?
'Right now' right now?
But I don't feel better!
How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?
Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette?
What's gonna happen to Daring?
Ah-ha!
Twilight has a copy of the book!
Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all...
Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!
Owww...
Oh, the pain, the pain!
Well, uh, my wing!
It's still hurtin', Doc.
Oh, ouch!
Right there.
Uh, right.
Well, I think that one's hurting now too.
B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc!
I'm not being lazy!
What am I gonna do?
I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do!
...Which may not be such a bad thing...
I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!
I'm an egghead.
See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of?
You got me.
Good?
Try awesomely amazing.
That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able!
But then I had to put it down... I was sent home before I could finish it.
Oh, thanks, Twilight.
I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this.
I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you.
Yeah, I get it.
I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.
Didja get all that?
Great!
You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book!
And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured... the world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do!
'Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet'.
Awesome!
Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.
You got it!
And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and?
What's going on?
Aren't you gonna stop him?
Oh, this is too rich.
Hey, Twilight!
There's a mouse right behind you!
Oh no!
Uhhh, I'm not so sure that's a?
Y'know, it really doesn't look too bad...
Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me!
You owe me!
Yeaagh!
Ugh!
Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time.
Shoot!
You don't think we missed them, do you?
Pfft, pretty lame move.
Is that all they've got?
Uh, not so much.
The word 'fierce' comes to mind.
Yeah, right, Spike.
That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!
One tough stain against one lame dragon.
Hey, guys!
Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
Spike, that's nonsense talk!
I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business!
They're big, and tough, and scary...
All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
Aaagh!
Don't tell me you think he should go?
I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things.
Rrgh.
Yeah, we hope your trip?
your quest answers some of your pesky Who am I?
questions.
Go get 'em, big guy!
I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
We can't worry about that now, Twilight.
We're here to help Spike!
Not so fast!
I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
Oh no, they took Spike!
We've gotta go after them!
I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!
Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
Calling all Pegasus ponies!
Meeting tonight!
Library, tonight.
Be cool or be mule.
No offense.
All right, go on in, find a seat.
You too, Fluttershy.
Come on, let's go.
So, here's the scoop.
Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria.
And you know what that means.
It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.
Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed.
Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power.
But I think we can do better.
I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane.
Nopony's getting sick on my watch.
So, are we gonna train hard?
Are we gonna be strong?
Are we gonna be fast?
Record-smashing fast?
Who's with me?
Fluttershy!
Stretch those glutes, Flitter!
Nice flexibility, Cloud Chaser.
A, little too much flexibility, Blossomforth.
Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof.
Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane!
Good pace, Silverspeed!
Keep it up!
We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!
Good work, everypony!
Everypony except Fluttershy.
Fluttershy?
I know you're in there!
You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why!
Fluttershy, open?
Fluttershy, what happened to you?
Oh, you poor thing.
You know, there's only one cure for pony pox.
Cold water!
Those pony pox are clearing right up.
Messed up wing, huh?
Stop horsing around, Fluttershy.
We've got a lot of training to do.
Come on now, what's going on?
What are you talking about?
Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
It wasn't that bad.
Suck it up, Fluttershy!
This is no time for?
I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you.
I need every ounce of wing power I can get.
Thanks anyway.
You will?
You're game?
Alright!
Don't worry, Twilight.
Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed.
Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?
Not bad, not bad.
Now listen up!
If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.
wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record.
We'll be number one!
Impressive.
Fluttershy, your turn.
No, you tell her!
Um, great job, Fluttershy!
Fluttershy, wait!
So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal.
You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?
But I need you!
This is crazy awesome!
We're gonna smash that record!
You did awesome, Fluttershy.
So you won't fly with 10.
wing power.
Every bit counts!
If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
Are we ready to do this?
Lazy Thunderlane!
Where is he?
He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all.
Rumble, where's your lazy brother?
Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
Phew!
Of course not.
Forget the record.
Cloudsdale still needs water!
Okay, everypony!
Let's give it all we've got!
On the sound of the horn, we take off!
Yaa?
oof!
I'm fine!
Rbbbb?
We've got to try again!
One more time!
I've gotta know we gave it our all!
If I'm going down, I'm going down flying!
C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!
Stay in position!
Flap those wings!
Faster!
C'mon!
Just a little harder!
I can see the water trying to funnel through!
Whoa, girl, take it easy!
Yeah, we did it!
You did it!
Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy!
Let's hear it for Fluttershy!
You guys!
The new Gabby Gums just came out!
The Great and Powerful Trixie's Secrets Revealed!
Did you forget who you're talking to?
The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license.
Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet.
Are you kidding?
Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
It's that good, huh?
Well, maybe just one little hoof.
Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves.
Man, I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me.
Well, my life is officially over.
Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.
I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late!
I'm a laughing stock!
Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums!
Are you kidding?
Everypony in town knows it's you three.
I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
So, Fine!
If you want to stand guard, go for it.
We're going to bed.
What happened?
I-I don't even like cake!
I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!
Cut it out!
Aw nuts, so did I.
And boy was it!
Yeah, I just dove right in!
Sorry, Pinkie.
Yes!
A sonic rainboom?
At a wedding?
Can you say best wedding ever?
Whoa, what's with all the guards?
Sorry, Twi.
Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
You sure this is what I should wear?
Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way.
Best, wedding, ever!
Crystal what?
Eh, I don't see what the big deal is.
Just looks like another old castle to me.
Yeah, who doesn't?
A way to protect the Empire!
You know anything about it or what?
Hold on!
You gotta know something!
I got nothing so far.
Ugh.
We totally nailed it, right?
Must be feeling a lot of love and unity about now!
Gonna have some grub, huh?
What are you thinking?
Crystal Empire berry pie?
Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob!
What is with these ponies?
Of course we have it!
Can't have a Crystal Faire without the Crystal Heart, right?
W-what's that about 'powering the heart'?
I think we may have a problem...
I think we may have a problem...
Let's do this!
Name it.
What?
With that thing moving into the Empire?
Yeah, and?
Keep the Faire going and the Crystal Ponies' spirits high.
Done and done!
Who wants a flugelhorn?
Who else wants a flugelhorn?
What are you lookin' at?
That's what I thought!
Exactly.
Huh.
Seeing my awesomeness does have a way of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.
Come on, Knight Fluttershy.
It's showtime.
The fate of an entire empire rests on us showing these ponies a good time.
But, y'know, if that isn't important to you...
Okay, okay, I'll take it easy on you next time.
But not too easy.
I've got a reputation to maintain!
This punk cloud got so heavy it's making fog.
Figure I'll thin this bad boy out so it floats back up.
Uh, thanks, Pinkie...
Hey, Pinkie.
Got something fun planned this afternoon thought you might wanna know about.
Actually, what I meant is after I'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays.
Wanna hang?
But, that's when I'll be at the swimming hole.
Ah, well, doesn't matter.
Whichever one you choose is okay with me.
I don't know, Cloud busting was tougher work than usual today.
I'm kind of exhausted.
Glad you made it, Pinkie.
I thought you maybe went to Applejack's, instead.
The barn up yet?
But I thought you said you were just at Applejack's.
Duplicates of you, huh?
Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie.
Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh...
How'd you do that?
What the?
Wow!
Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates!
Except now there's triplicates, and quadruplicates!
No more Pinkies!
I can't take it!
Hey, Twilight!
Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down.
Wait up, I got one more!
Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces.
Ugh, I can't take it anymore!
Somepony's making balloon animals!
Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride!
Twilight!
Come quick!
It's an emergency!
You call that great and powerful?
I've got it!
Trying to sneak past the force field would be impossible without help, but I know who's got the goods to get into those woods!
Fluttershy!
Perfect!
Fluttershy'll sneak out of Ponyville and find Twilight.
Yow!
Stop it!
Tha?
that tickles!
Sorry.
This is going back into hiding where it belongs.
Nice moves, kid.
What took you guys so long?
Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?
Sure!
Long as you don't snore.
You don't snore, do you?
Then you and I are gonna get along just fine.
You have got to be kidding me.
Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood.
Seriously though.
Can you get us some wood for the fire?
Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard.
Okay, maybe it's the second best story you've ever heard.
But probably still the scariest.
You like scary stories, right?
It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this...
...And then, The Olden Pony asked, Who's got my rusty horseshoe?
You do!
Knew you wouldn't be scared.
The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me, fearless.
That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!
I'm hitting the sack.
Come in whenever you feel like it.
What's that noise?
Is there a bug in here?
I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly.
Glad you're rested up, because we've got a long trek ahead.
Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls.
Doesn't matter to me.
All right!
A deep, dark cave!
Perfect for the story I've got for tonight.
All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go.
Thanks.
That's it?
Now, where was I?
Oh yeah, the scary part.
Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one.
No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking.
I've been told that these very woods are haunted, by The Headless Horse!
It gallops only at night?
It's headless, not brainless.
...and they were never heard from ever again!
Never.
Sleep tight.
That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!
I gotcha!
What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?
Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it.
First time I heard those stories, I was scared too.
Sure!
I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on.
So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?
Yeah, I might be up for something like that.
As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.
They think they can beat the two of us?
Here it is, for pony's sake.
Now take it and stop all your moaning.
I'm not nervous at all.
When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy, I'm telling you, it's in the bag.
In Ponyville?
I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria.
I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day.
I, didn't get in.
Gotcha!
Ha, you guys are so gullible.
Like I wasn't gonna get in!
Uh, thanks?
Pinkie Pie?
I kinda need to get going.
The sooner I get there, the sooner I get to show 'em my stuff!
See you guys in a week!
Won't need it!
Oh, yeah!
This is gonna be sweet!
No, ma'am!
I'd never quit, ma'am!
One more lap to go!
Rainbow Dash!
Definitely.
Yes, ma'am!
I make everything look easy.
No pony even came close to six seconds.
Yeah, they should.
Heh, yeah.
So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony?
What?
A wingpony?
Permission to enter, ma'am.
I had the best time on the Dizzitron!
Only six seconds!
And you made me a wingpony!
Yes, ma'am!
I mean no, ma'am!
I mean, We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am.
I think I should be lead pony, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Ready.
Not yet.
There's one!
We should slow down.
It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!
Uh, sure.
Just give me a second.
Yeah, totally.
Doesn't matter!
We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!
Thank you, ma'am.
Um, Lightning Dust?
Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that.
Yeah, I-I guess you're right...
But we're already way ahead.
I'm in!
Noooooo!
Are you guys okay?
Pinkie Pie!
Well, yeah, of course I remember you.
But, what are you all doing here?
Awesome?
My friends could have been smashed to pieces!
A hoof bump?
Seriously?
You made me clip my wing.
You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course.
You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!
And I get that you want to be the best.
So do I!
But you're going about it in the wrong way.
You're right.
She did.
We're done with that, ma'am.
That's why I'm here, ma'am.
Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado.
Yeah, well that effective tactic nearly took out my friends!
No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless.
And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it.
I quit.
Not anymore.
OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!
Yes, ma'am!
AJ, Rarity, what's happening?
Sweet!
What are you having him do?
Wash your laundry?
Clean your room?
Help you with your unfinished novel?
Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts!
Just came to me.
That's easy!
Just make him help you with something really, really hard.
Puh-lease.
He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt!
Leave this to me.
Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today.
Yeah, I am.
So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks!
Yeah!
A huge tower of rocks!
And you're gonna build it!
Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack...
Then get to it!
Trust me.
This is gonna work like a charm!
Huh.
I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks.
Bad news: He actually ended up building the whole rock tower.
Good news, I've got a rock tower to knock down.
Sure!
Why not, Bbbbrrr.
Yeah.
I guess I'm good.
For now.
Timberwolf!
A visitor who's important and slow.
If by serious havoc you mean turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world...
Fluttershy?
Really?
Hey, slackers!
Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?
We're all waiting on you!
Try us, Dip-cord!
You go, Fluttershy!
Don't listen to him, Fluttershy!
He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does.
So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, that's why!
You big liar!
We'll be outside.
Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole befriending business doesn't work out.
Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!
That's one creepy little gravy boat if you ask me.
Hey!
That's hot!
He did that on purpose!
I'm not falling for that!
Discord's just trying to distract us from?
Hey!
Knock it off!
I suppose that's another mistake?
Fluttershy!
Can't you see what he's doing?
He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him!
You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy?
Fluttershy!
What's gotten into you?
Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?
Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres!
And we all know who's behind that now, don't we?
Oh, give it a rest!
What do you think of your friend now, Fluttershy?
You see Discord's behind all this, right?
Tch!
Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny.
He can take care of himself.
He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet.
Alright.
uh, Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone.
You know, the two of us are very diligent.
A-hem, I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts.
Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something?
Tank has a tendency to?
All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet.
You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle, once.
Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this.
He woulda' had fun here.
Hurry up, Twilight!
We can't miss our train!
Duh!
Of course they're excited.
They're up for the Equestria Games.
It's only the biggest sporting event in all of Equestria.
Cloudsdale should have hosted the games one year.
I'll never forget when we got the bad news.
These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse.
They've had enough bad news.
No way we're letting them experience the pain of losing out on these games.
You heard the pony!
On your hooves!
And it's probably also because we'll be awesome at it.
Yup, I remember that feeling.
But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things didn't work out.
That right there.
That is the face I do not want to see.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're trying to land the Equestria Games here.
There is no such thing as a small detail!
Way to step it up, Rare!
What!
You couldn't have told her that news first!
That's fifteen minutes from now!
I'll just ignore that.
We need to remember that the Games Inspector arriving early is probably part of a plan to psych us out.
You said it yourself.
She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games.
Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games.
Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it.
Excuse me, ma'am?
You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence.
Watch that.
It's all part of the game.
She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation.
Looks like we passed.
Bump?
Or, if you like, we could give you a tour of the castle!
That way you could be learning and stretching all at the same time!
It's just another test!
We gotta roll with it, remember?
Huh?
I got this.
Wanna stretch your legs, huh?
Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide.
Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium.
Our tour will now be headed, this way.
Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium.
Wait, that's the Games Inspector!
Let her do her thing.
I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not.
Yeah, okay, we need to stop her.
Closer, closer, I think we've got her...
Yaaaaaaah!
enjoying your visit?
glad!
From the looks of it, just locking up the games for the Crystal Empire is all.
Ain't no thing.
We got the wrong pony?
Except that there isn't!
Okay, here's what we do.
We split the Empire up into five sectors.
Oh, there she is!
We're in luck!
I don't think either of them knows yet that the other one's here!
Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything.
When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games.
But it didn't happen.
So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games.
But it looks like I ruined your chances instead.
We did it!
You know, it feels good to help others get something you always wanted but never had.
Almost as good as getting it yourself.
Almost.
You're right.
That'll rock!
Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this.
He woulda' had fun here.
Hey, guys.
Whoa!
I'm in here!
Help!
I'm trapped!
Um, hello?
Friend trapped inside, remember?
Uh, what just happened?
Say no more!
Twilight's got wings!
Awesome!
A new flying buddy!
You gotta really flap 'em hard.
Uh, maybe not quite that hard.
Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't!
Now get up there and show everypony the big finish!
I don't know if it's everypony's dream.
Oh, no, you don't!
This is Ponyville territory, and we aren't due for rain until after the Summer Sun Celebration.
You Everfree clouds need to just head on back to where you belong!
Whoa!
Gonna make me do this the hard way, huh?
Hey!
All I know is the sky's split in two, and these clouds moving in sure aren't from around here.
Oh, yeah, just like old times.
Yeah, right!
This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!
I say we blast him back to stone!
Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them?
The tree of what now?
Aw, you'll figure it out eventually.
Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it.
Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause?
We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle.
Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real.
Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony.
Maybe?
It can't be!
Nice try.
Heh- Whoa!
Oof!
It was your idea, Applejack!
Up here!
Yeah.
Equestria may need its princess...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh.
How are we supposed to protect Equestria?
I'm not gonna move.
You move.
But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is!
You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony!
Okay, no problem.
We just have to come up with another daring dare.
Uh, what's so daring about this place?
This is where we got the Elements of Harmony.
You mean, like a ghost?
Ugh.
I don't see what's so daring about an old legend.
Plus, I don't believe in ghosts.
Run!
Okay, so, maybe the legend is true!
Scared?
I'm not scared!
Then it's settled!
Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony.
But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.
I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!
I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all!
W-what's the matter?
It's just a dark hallway full of, disembodied pony legs.
Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it.
You don't need to put your hoof around me.
You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Whoa!
It's just old pony armor.
What's the big deal?
Uh, Applejack?
If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?
Come on, castle!
Is that all you got?
Fluttershy?
What are you doing here?
On whether or not you're the Pony of Shadows.
You're the Pony of Shadows?
Yeah!
Why weren't you scared?
Me too!
Four more months, four more months, four more months!
I bet you're excited, huh?
Come on, you gotta be excited!
I thought so!
Because the next Daring Do book is coming out exactly four months from today!
That's how exciting it is!
So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?
Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon?
Only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense?
And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day?
Or will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?
Would she cower, turn tail and run?
Or would she fly at him, full bore, knowing full well against all odds that the greatest challenge she ever faced was still surely no match for?
Three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days!
Heya, Twilight!
Aren't you excited that?
What's everypony doing here?
So what holiday would today be?
How come nopony bothered to invite me?
Yeah, well, in three months and twenty six more days, I'll be able to read the next one.
Two more months?
I've been waiting so long already!
I don't think I can take another two months!
I'll never make it!
Did they give a reason?
How could you possibly know that before me?
I'm the series' biggest fan!
Right.
Where she lives?
Don't you get it?
The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing!
So I?
I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP!
Think about it!
We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever!
Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?
She can always just say no.
Of course I am.
So, how's about getting that address?
I think I spotted the house!
We're super close!
This way!
Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already...
I know!
There might be no more books!
Uh, But, of course, I'd be worried about her, too.
Heh.
Okay, clearly this isn't the best time, but I've just gotta say how much we all really love your books...
Great!
Maybe now would be a good time for me to ask her how we can help move the new book along a little faster.
Chop chop!
Aw, come on, I knew it all along.
Daring Do!
He's from book four: Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams.
He wanted to partner with Daring Do on her adventures.
Are you okay?
We've gotta go help!
How can we just stand by and do nothing?
You know what's at stake here!
Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three!
But the Radiant Shield of Razdon is vulnerable to the dark enchantment of the Rings of Scorchero!
Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan!
Did you ever think of that?
We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late!
I'm coming, Daring Do!
Come on, come on, come on, Bingo!
Here I come, Daring Do!
To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could ever?
Okay, maybe I just need a sec...
Just another adventure.
No big deal.
Get a grip!
I got this.
Though, doing it alongside Daring Do, Wow!
Maybe I could get my picture taken with her, or an autograph?
There you go again.
She's just a pony like any other pony.
A pony who stops entire armies of bad guys with nothing more than her bare hooves, and an attitude, and?
Ow, That's starting to hurt.
Yow!
Stop!
Wait, don't go!
Think fast.
This is your big chance to impress her with your quick wit and courage.
I am suuuuuch a huge fan.
Wait, wait, wait!
Let me help you!
I promise I could be a huge, huge help if you just give me a chance.
But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?
But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted!
Neither do I.
Let's go!
Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town.
Oh, I see.
You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves!
Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing!
Or maybe- 
Okay.
I'll be quiet now.
Just watching very quietly, heh.
Shh.
So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then?
Wow!
Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool, she's got this!
Come on, Daring Do, come on, Daring Do!
I've got your hat!
You want me to toss it?
Daring Do!
Daring Do!
Whoa!
Don't worry, Daring Do!
I'll come help you!
Whoa!
What have I done?
In here.
Daring Do and the ring have been captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl, and it's all my fault.
Whatever.
Let's just go home.
Trying to help is how I got in this mess in the first place.
You were right, Twilight.
We should've stayed out of this.
She doesn't want my help, Twilight.
My hero's way better off without me.
She's here where she's got no business being.
She should be at home.
Gotcha!
You can flap too, y'know!
Of course.
I just thought you might need this.
Have I mentioned yet that you're lucky I don't?
W-Was this your plan all along?
You did it on purpose?
But?
but I thought?
Ponies!
Run!
This place is goin' down!
Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever.
Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was.
Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else.
Sweet!
The new book a week before anypony else gets it!
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Oh, come on!
Tell 'em the fun part!
That's right!
All you gotta do is show Ms Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games!
So who's going to be the lucky ponies?
So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games!
Oh, you are gonna love this!
Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later.
Tell 'em the important stuff!
Like who's the coach!
That's right!
And you know why I'm qualified to coach you?
Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little filly?
I'll never forget it, I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze.
I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since!
Yes, Ms Harshwhinny.
Y'know, professionalism is my middle name.
Rainbow Professionalism Dash.
Ahem.
Yes.
Quite, quite correct.
In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives!
But, I know you're up for the challenge.
And so am I!
Wooho, Ahem...
Meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours.
Sharp.
And show me your flag carrying skills.
I am outta here.
Professionally.
See how professionally?
Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good!
That was ama, Wait.
Hold on now.
Gotta stay calm, cool and collected.
To give a calm, clear analysis, Wait.
You whipped that act together just yesterday?
That is, Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check!
Overall, it was, kinda, sorta, Overall, it was okay.
Keep working hard.
Who knows?
You might have a shot.
Gotta go!
Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow.
I know you're gonna absolutely, positively, have a lot of fun, heheh.
Okay, go!
That's, y'know, good and all, heheh, I just thought, maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better?
Just do the routine as it was!
Don't mess with success, right?
Seriously.
Now I need to, go coach these other ponies!
And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire.
See you in the morning!
How's my favorite routine going today?
Oh, I just can't keep it in!
I want you to win so bad!
She's what?
And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?
Hang on.
Are you nuts?
You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind!
Come on!
Put on some speed, girls!
Throwing away your scooter?
Yup, but not just me.
What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?
And who said you had to?
But that was me!
You're you!
And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not.
Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special.
You do still know what that is, right?
Listen, Scootaloo.
Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't.
You're all kinds of awesome anyway.
Who's the toughest little pony in town?
Ahem.
Look.
What you three did was, acceptable.
Contain your excitement, Ms Harshwhinny.
Remember, professionalism.
You got it!
I'm good!
Spike!
So somepony zap us back out!
Pinkie!
Where'd she go?
Whoa-whoa!
No biggie.
I was already awesome.
And now we've all got superpowers!
So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!
Then leave the rest to us!
Come on out, Mane-iac!
Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!
Seriously?
You aren't even just a little angry right now?
Just watch us!
Get mad!
Need a place to put these guys!
Awesome!
Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?
What about the cider?
There was still cider, right?
No cider?
No cider?
We need to round up these monsters, and we need to do it now!
What's the problem?
You've used the Stare plenty of times before!
Me too!
Think of the cider!
Won't somepony please think of the cider?
First round of cider's on me!
Gotcha!
Ye-he-heah, whoo!
We'll be drinking cider all winter long!
I hear ya, Applejack!
C'mon, everypony!
Let's track down those vampire bats!
The witching hour, Uh, who's there?
Answer me or you'll regret it!
Fine, have it your own way!
Take that, you, you, you, scarecrow...
Fluttershy!
It's me, Rainbow Dash!
Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?
Whoa!
Maybe we should just let her come down when she's ready.
Our fault?
Hit the deck!
If she keeps this up, your whole crop will be gone in no time!
So much for having the winning apple in the Appleloosa State Fair, huh?
She's coming!
Does that mean what I think it means?
Yea-he-heah, whoo!
Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria!
I know.
Ponies just bursting into song in random places at the drop of a hat?
Who does that?
I'm on it!
Hey, buddy!
Is this cab taken?
Huh?
What?
Does everypony in this town want a cab?
Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed!
Is, everything okay?
But he said he brought them.
Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then...
Wow, Applejack.
I know your thing is honesty, but come on!
I loved it!
Uh, I mean, it was a'ight.
Alright, ponies, listen up!
I like your attitude, Bulk Biceps, but it's gonna take more than muscles and Yeah!
s to get us to the Equestria Games!
We are the Aerial Relay team, and it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the tryouts.
And do I need to remind you how much I - I mean, Ponyville, heh, wants to qualify and make it to the Games?
Just make sure you have one ready for when we qualify for the Aerial Relay.
Alright, team!
Show me what you got!
Put some bend into those knees!
Flap those wings!
And I want to see all four hooves off the ground on the count of three!
One two three!
Don't forget to breathe while you're up there!
Nothing nice about it.
I know that I can pick up the slack for anypony.
With me on the team, we'll qualify.
I'm sure of it.
Yeah, I'm pretty awesome.
The Wonderbolts know a winner when they see one, and we'll be winners just as soon as we practice!
Right team?
So, do I need to remind you of what our goal is here?
We want to qualify!
We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line!
Bulk Biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it!
What the?
Okay, the passing of the baton needs to be seamless.
You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude!
And whatever you do, don't let go of it!
We were using that!
And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!
I guess some ponies do.
Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others.
Watch and learn.
The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts, and Wonderbolts are the best flyers there are.
And my personal heroes.
So, maybe you can learn something.
Please learn something?
Gotcha!
Ah, it was nothin'.
But, if you feel like talking about how great I am, don't let me stop you!
Tough break to lose a teammate right before the tryouts.
Fly?
Uh, I don't know.
My team really needs me to be at my best in order to qualify.
Don't wanna be too worn out by the time the race comes around.
Heh, I did kick some major tail at the Academy, but I don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition.
Alright, I'll do it.
Come on, Bulk Biceps, you can do it!
Nnnngh, You, uh, keep doing your wing-ups.
I'm just gonna get some, uh, water.
You, know?
Does anypony else?
Well, I've seen the other teams practicing and we're still gonna qualify.
I can fly fast enough to make up the distance.
But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than, um, the non-winners.
Besides, Ponyville will still qualify.
Uh, sure.
They want me to fly with them!
It's like a dream come true!
Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team!
What would you do?
Woe is me!
Oooh!
Urgh, I've hurt my hoof, I, uh, tripped on a-a foam hoof and landed on a, pokey stick coming out of the ground...
There is no way I can fly now.
I'll be lucky if I ever fly again!
I just need a little rest.
Everything!
Absolutely everything!
Thank you.
I couldn't have done that on my own.
That might help.
I've been better.
Well, hopefully your wing will be better soon.
What do you mean, 'wants you back'?
Spitfire and Fleetfoot told me that you were still too injured to fly!
That somepony else was me!
Until, uh, well, until I got hurt, that is.
I-I feel great, because, I was never hurt in the first place.
I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale.
I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!
I know now who I should've been loyal to.
Ponyville.
Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are.
The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not.
You lied to me about Soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer!
You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team I wanna be a part of.
Come on, Ponyville relay team!
We've got a race to get ready for!
Oh, I can't deny it.
I love to win!
But if I ever gotta choose between winning and being loyal to my friends, I'm always gonna choose my friends.
'Cause as much as I love winning, I love them waaaaay more.
Uh, sorry.
Something in my throat, like a big ball of 'lame'!
What is that?
Whatever color you are is the color of trouble!
If you're so 'sick', why have you come here instead of, y'know, staying home in bed and getting over your weird illness?
You need to chill.
Fluttershy's out.
Good thinking.
Head on home, put your feet up.
I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something...
Not it!
Yeah!
Yes, Pinkie?
Uh, yeah?
I guess.
Okay.
I'll tell you what, making this party epic!
'Cause this isn't just any birthday.
It's also the anniversary of when I moved to Ponyville!
Exactly!
So what do you say, party planners?
C'mon, everypony!
Let's party down with Cheese!
Yeah!
Hah, now that's what I'm talking about!
I'm so stoked you're here, Cheese Sandwich!
I mean, Pinkie Pie's parties are fun and sweet and all, but now this party's gonna be...
You said it!
Oh, yeah!
Uh, heh, no offense, Pinkie.
My birth-iversary's already looking way cooler!
You are my kind of party pony, Cheese Sandwich.
Totally awesome!
She actually has a goof off rulebook?
Heh.
Big tense competition on my birth-iversary.
What could be better?
But I haven't named a winner.
Pinkie, wait!
I'm sorry I got all swept away by Cheese Sandwich.
But don't you get it?
You're both super duper party ponies.
Sure, Cheese Sandwich is a great guest party pony, but you're Ponyville's permanent party pony.
Nopony could ever take your place, and we could never have a party without you.
Enough with the warm fuzzy stuff, you two.
It's my birth-iversary, and you gotta throw me a bash!
Hey, everypony!
Who's ready to get their party on?
Hit it!
Cheese Sandwich!
Oh, I gotta tell ya, you and Pinkie have totally made this the best birthday/anniversary super combo ever!
Yeah, it is!
Wow!
I can't believe how many ponies showed up!
Yeah!
Whoo-oo-oo!
Pinkie Pie and I can hang lights and decorations in the town square!
Uh, yeah, we did!
Spit it out!
You totally blew my mind!
The thunderous applause?
You did it, Fluttershy!
I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!
That's too strong!
We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!
Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!
What if we speed it up?
I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?
Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.
Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet.
Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home.
Uh, alright.
We just have to trust Fluttershy.
She must know what she's doing.
It's too strong!
Fly back!
I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down.
Now it's too light!
Oh, this will never get them home!
Holy mini-sized paradise!
Whoa!
That was a close one!
So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon.
You sure?
What about a dragon?
It doesn't have to shoot fire!
I don't see what's so important we had to meet her here this early.
Celestia hasn't even raised the sun yet!
Ugh!
Hey- whoa!
Ugh.
My teeth hurt.
Hold on.
The secret ingredient is rocks?
I doubt she'll notice what anypony's wearing, so what's the big deal?
Uh, you sure?
Is she even moving?
Huh?
So, uh, Pinkie Pie tells us you like games.
Awesome?
Really?
Oh, come on!
We spent all day digging in the dirt, and he was in her pocket the whole time?
He's a rock!
Yeah!
Let's see you beat that!
Whooaa!
Whoa.
How'd you do that?
I guess you won this one, Maud.
Maybe, but who really knows?
That pony is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an igneous.
Nope.
I mean igneous.
It's a kind of rock.
Ask me how I know that.
Huh?
Like I said: Huh?
What?
how?
what?
Did you see how fast Maud moved?
Uh, we noticed.
And we're totally cool with it.
Heh, sure do feel like relaxing!
Yeah!
Surprise!
Puh-lease, Twilight.
That was the worst sneak attack ever.
I saw you giving me the stink-eye from the ground and heard you flying towards me and muttering from a mile away.
Yeah, yeah, the Wonderbolts history test.
No big deal.
Twilight, not everypony gets all freaked out about tests like you.
Uh, seriously?
Your freakouts are so epic, you sing whole freakout arias about freaking out.
Sure.
Fun.
Wha?
huh?
And ginormous!
Okay, but how am I supposed to get what's in there into here?
Of course.
Is it snack time?
Recess?
Can't we just watch the history of the Wonderbolts movie?
Here!
Oh, does that mean I'll learn in a flash?
What?
I was, riveted by your captivating cards!
Got what?
With a spit wad?
Really?
Clearly.
Bring it!
Ernie's undercooked pancakes.
Celestia's cereal celebration.
Hello?
General Blazing Donut Glaze!
So, did I ace it or what?
What?
But?
but how?
My dreams of being in the Wonderbolts Reserve would have been totally crushed!
What am I gonna do?
I'm running out of time!
I don't know any of this history!
I'm gonna fail!
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail!
And it's all your fault!
Maybe your famous study methods aren't all they're cracked up to be, eh, teacher?
Yeah, right.
Uh, well?
Fine!
Rub it in, why don't ya?
Besides, I don't see why I have to take this lousy test anyway.
I've proven I'm one of the best flyers around.
Yeah, right.
Some history buff like you must have made that up to bring us flyers down.
Beneficial for eggheads!
Just 'cause you've got wings, doesn't mean you can fly!
You're barely able to just get off the ground!
Yeah, sorry.
Oh, who's that, who's that?
Uh, now what?
Uh, how are you getting all this?
Stop, stop, stop!
That was aw?
Well, I give it a whoa, whoa, what?
I'm totally confused and I just wanna go home...
Whoa?
hey!
Yes, Pinkie Pie!
General This and Colonel That, they're the Wonderbolts, something that rhymes with that!
What?
No, really?
But I've gotta learn this stuff!
Now!
Rarity, you look ridiculous.
Good luck.
Pinkie, you're real!
It's too much for my eyes!
Really?
Well, what special study trick do you have, AJ?
Twelve hours.
Enough!
No rapping, no cards, no costumes, no play, and no apples!
I am never gonna pass this test, ever!
Just forget it!
It's okay.
You were just trying to help.
It's just too bad I'm too dumb to learn anything.
If by differently you mean not at all, then you're totally right.
See?
Wrong again.
Well, that's not going to get me into the Wonderbolts.
Great.
My years of being a class clown prevented me from actually learning how to learn!
I know.
You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice.
Ha-hah, you're such a rookie.
An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask.
It's essential!
Yes, I was paying attention to you, but was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems.
Flying's not just flying!
In order to stay safe in the sky, I've got to hear and see everything down to the littlest details.
For instance, I saw Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo come out of Sugarcube Corner, and from the looks of it, they had carrot cupcakes with sprinkles.
And I'm thinking Big Mac sold a huge order of apples to Filthy Rich, 'cause I heard him give a very hearty?
I always make note of everything when I fly.
No biggie.
What?
Yeah, I get it.
I wouldn't want to hang out with a loser like me either.
Sure.
Got nothing better to do.
Didn't we just do this?
Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll become a great flyer in no time.
After all, you're good at everything.
Oh, nothing.
Just getting my dreams crushed.
Just history books.
I'd tell you what they were about, but my brain is as dry as a rock.
Maybe I'll go work there as I have no other plans for the rest of my life.
Seems my dream has given up on me.
Maybe I'll learn to shine shoes, sell hats, dig ditches...
Twilight, give it up!
I have.
Nothing important.
Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.
Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons.
And, at the celebration of the first Celestial year of peace, an elite flying squadron performed, headed by General Firefly, who later named the group the Wonderbolts!
Commander Easyglider established flight choreography that is still used by the Wonderbolts today!
I, I know the history!
I know it all!
But how in Equestria did that happen?
Yeah, I got that!
But how?
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Thank you!
Thank you all so much!
Ha, I always knew I was brilliant!
Yeeeaah!
Whoo!
There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it!
I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one!
Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first!
If it hasn't been traded yet...
It's the only one in all of Equestria!
Normally I'd say I don't need any help, but you're right.
This is really important.
I've gotta get that book!
There it is!
The first edition of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue!
It hasn't been traded yet!
Lucky for you, because I've brought my most valuable possession to trade for it: My lucky horseshoe!
What?
You got it!
I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that Orthros.
Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight.
I need to trade this horseshoe for, that.
Aww.
A whole stand filled with Discord-shaped lamps?
Seriously?
Will you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so I can trade it for an Orthros and get my book?
Great!
What's an antique chicken?
Okay, cool!
So will you trade one for a horseshoe so I can trade it for a lamp and then trade it for an Orthros so I can get my book?
Hold on a sec.
We need a crystal chalice to trade for a chicken to trade for a lamp to trade for an Orthros.
So what are you willing to trade for it?
I'm guessing it's gotta be some crazy thing way across the Exchange.
Yeah, like where am I gonna find?
wait, I've got one of those!
Now that we've got the chalice, this is gonna be a cinch!
All we gotta do is bring this thing to the chicken stand and we are?
Well, that took forever.
Oh no!
The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted!
Okay, look.
I'm fast.
I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants.
Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay?
Beat it!
You go.
I'll stay here.
Hello!
We got the kind of chicken you asked for!
Hello?
Where's the pony running this joint?
'On break'?
Look, I know it's your break and all, but you've gotta open your stand so we can trade you for a lamp!
Oh come on, please?
But the Exchange ends at sundown!
I've got an idea.
Next!
Next!
Next!
Next!
Next!
We're home free!
As long as this thing doesn't drown us in slobber.
We gotta hurry!
We're never gonna get to the Daring Do stand through this crowd in time!
Come on!
We gotta go!
Okay, the Exchange is almost over, but we did it.
We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken...
And the lamp for an Orthros, just like you asked.
So there you go!
Now where's my book?
Argh!
Ugh, Hey!
You said you wanted an Orthros!
Yes!
Of course it's a deal!
Yeah-eah, whoo!
I did it, I did it!
Fluttershy, can you believe it?
Oh no.
what did I do?
Twilight!
I need you to say a trade wasn't fair!
Fast!
Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong!
I did want that book, a lot.
I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria.
But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend.
I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true.
Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!
Oh, come on!
You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other!
That's the coolest thing a friend can do.
Trust me, I know.
I traded it for something way better.
Even better, because I can read this one with all my friends!
Take that!
And that!
What in the...
This just got real!
Listen up, gang!
We're almost there, so I've got a few things to say.
First off, who here besides me thinks this is the best Equestria Games delegation in Ponyville history?
And no matter what your sport is, we gotta give it our best, because we've all got a genuine shot at Ponyville gold!
I mean, we're good and all, but we're up against the Wonderbolts in the aerial relay, so gold's kind of a stretch.
Let's not kid ourselves.
Uh, that's because you're carrying the flag for Ponyville in the opening ceremony.
There are no winners.
That's the spirit!
You hear that, everypony?
Winners or not, we all still have the chance to be awesome!
But, uh, let's still try to win lots and lots of stuff too, 'kay?
Awesome!
Ya done good, squirt!
Psst, here he comes now!
Act casual!
'Sup?
But Cloudsdale has two ice archery finalists down there now!
If they both place, Cloudsale wins the medal count!
Those aren't your average arrows.
They freeze whatever part of the target they hit.
Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins.
Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale, he's the favorite.
Steer it towards the field, away from the crowds!
That was awesome!
Hmm, wonder which medal that was?
Bam!
You only mentioned it about fifteen times on the train here.
Heh, point taken.
So what are you supposed to do in the meantime?
You want some company?
I still can't believe we had to give back the Elements.
What are you even doing here, Discord?
In your dreams!
Sure!
But being loyal to my friends was way?
Best party I've ever had.
Whoa!
Twilight?
Must have been or something, because there wasn't any breeze up there.
I'll bet he takes his sweet time.
Don't do it, Twilight!
We've been over it like a million times, Twilight!
We found all six keys, defeated Tirek, and got this sweet castle!
End of story!
Y'know what?
There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route.
Count me in!
Yes!
This is where the map sent us?
It looks like the most boring place in Equestria.
Okay, that's weird.
I bet there's some sort of horrific monster behind it.
'Cause fighting a horrific monster would be super-awesome!
Great idea, AJ.
Let's go!
Ugh.
Thanks a lot, map.
Be ready to fight.
We don't know what's gonna come through that door.
You're kidding, right?
Give up our cutie marks?
No way!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is she for real?
No, the reason to be rude is that they all keep staring at us!
Don't drag me into this!
Okay, that was weird too.
You think?
So what's stopping you?
Go get your cutie marks back.
Forget it, Twilight.
This door's not opening.
You've been saying how great this place is since we got here!
Not interested!
You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutie marks back!
Don't worry.
Fluttershy will have us out of here in no time!
This guy's a barrel of laughs.
Come on!
Let's go get our cutie marks!
Look!
Oh, come on!
I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save our cutie marks!
She's gonna get away!
She's getting away!
Up all night, huh?
Is that why she's so, uh, out of it?
You think that's weird?
She raced me, like, a hundred times the other day.
And lost every time!
She just kept goin'!
Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred!
I mean, I know hanging out with me is awesome, but it was like she'd rather keep losing than?
Yeah.
Who does that?
There's gonna be cider?
Uh, I mean, let's decorate!
We sure did, something.
Fluttershy, I love that you brought so many animals.
I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophies but with my name permanently etched onto them.
It's pretty bad, right?
What're we gonna do?
Come on, guys, we've gotta do something!
Twilight's counting on us!
How about this?
How about these?
Then let's lose the curtains!
The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark!
They can't all be your favorite!
Okay, I'm taking down the portrait.
We all know what we look like.
Not if I help you first!
You're right.
There is literally nothing cluttering this castle.
Why is this so hard?
We're Twilight's best friends!
This should be easy for us!
But it's not your home.
It's Twilight's home!
Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys just cleaned up?
That was good times.
And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library.
Look at that, Tank!
Cloudsdale's here!
That means Ponyville is next up for winter!
You're doing awesome, everypony!
Keep it up!
We need those leaves off those trees!
Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be hello, winter!
Was that a yawn I just saw?
How can you be tired when the most exciting time of the year is right around the corner?
And don't forget the best part, our first winter together!
Come on, wake up!
Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding!
And over there, we can play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads!
Almost everything.
Does Tank look alright to you?
I know, right?
Totally!
Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right.
Well?
Okay, so give him a vitamin or something!
Maybe we're just staying up too late.
Uh, too many Daring Do stories.
Well, what's wrong with him then?
You do realize he's not a bear, right?
Come on!
Tortoises don't hibernate!
Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.
Well, then your book must be wrong!
Whatever.
Okay, thanks.
Come on, Tank.
To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert.
Come on!
You're practically twins!
But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?
Same family though, right?
I'll take that as a yes.
Well, what would you know?
You're a dragon!
Nopony knows you like I do, Tank.
All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping.
Come on!
These things are heavy!
Chock full of snowflakes!
We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank.
Tank?
Tank!
Don't say that word!
That one!
If you think hiber, you know, that napping thing, is so cute, why don't you go do it?
Somewhere far away from here?
What are you looking at?
Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation!
Who said anything about anger?
I didn't say anything about anger!
I'm not upset!
And I am not angry!
Do I look angry?
Come on, Tank!
Let's get out of here!
I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed!
Which, is exactly what you are.
But get up anyway!
You can't hiber?
you know.
What about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter?
Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire.
Don't you wanna do those things with me?
Think, Rainbow Dash, think!
Tank's only hibernating because it's cold, right?
Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the cold...
I just have to stop winter!
Hah!
Stopping winter is gonna be a breeze!
Ugh!
For every hoof step back, they go three hoof steps forward!
What are we gonna do?
Cloudsdale.
That's it, Tank!
If I can't stop winter in Ponyville, maybe I can stop it at the source!
Lunch hour!
Perfect!
The winter lab.
We're in, Tank!
Now we just gotta figure out a way to shut it down.
Sabotage snowflakes?
I think we gotta go bigger than that.
Wait here.
Hmm.
We could get rid of these clouds, but, that's still not big enough.
Slam dunk!
With no water, they can't make clouds or snow!
They can't make winter!
I hate to do this to those weather ponies, but desperate times call for desperate measures!
Oopsies!
Looks like these were a little loose!
And there goes winter down the drain!
Uh, I can't see!
Aaaaaah!
Let's get out of here!
You okay, Tank?
Whatever...
Whatever...
Didn't you hear me?
I said 'whatever'.
I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine.
Months?
I don't want him to go!
Uh-huh.
It's alright, Fluttershy.
It's alright.
I think so.
I feel better.
Really, I do.
Thanks, everypony.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh, Tank, I'm sure gonna miss you.
Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome.
I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank.
He's ready to hibernate.
Yeah, me too.
So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh?
Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit.
That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story.
I'll be right there.
Hey!
Yeah!
Uhh, I think we're gonna go hit the dance floor.
I think they're, jokes?
Way to go, Tree Hugger!
Rude, insensitive bullies?
Yeah, I mean Gilda!
When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, especially Pinkie Pie!
Mm-hmm.
And why do you care so much about griffons anyway?
Hey, you can totally take my place if you want.
I still have half a nap to finish.
Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in Griffonstone.
And then some.
It's like Twilight herself in book form.
Always carry plenty of bits.
The griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth.
Ugh.
Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us.
See?
These griffons are exactly like I'd thought they'd be.
Hello, Gilda.
What are you doing here?
Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us here.
We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back to Griffonstone!
Well, I don't care what she says.
We're gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to Ponyville!
Come on!
What, taking a bunch of pictures?
Knock yourself out.
But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas.
I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone!
Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss.
Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?
Never mind, I got it.
So how deep is this abyss?
Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits?
No wonder Gilda's such a delight.
You sure we can't just fly down?
Whoa!
Never mind, totally got my answer there.
Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.
Whoooa!
Ow, ooh!
My hoof!
Help!
Throw me another rope!
Wait!
Pinkie Pie, you get back here!
Can you throw down a rope or something?
Where does she think I'm gonna go?
I hope I don't go anywhere!
What took you so long, doofus?
I'm slipping!
The idol!
Thanks, Gilda.
And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back.
Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem.
Whoa, Pinkie.
That was, really sappy.
I don't know, Pinkie.
You really think these griffons are up for this?
We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know.
Whoa, Pinkie.
I guess that really was the problem we needed to solve.
Well, we'd better be heading home.
No, you haven't.
You've made two.
Just try and stop us!
Uh, Pinkie?
Who are you talking to?
Whoa!
That's where the bugbear bit me!
I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute.
I mean, they even broke the trophy.
Um, I-I had a thing...
It could be better.
You'll show 'em a good time!
Why are your eyes darting around like that?
Aerial recon turned up nothing either.
Piece o' cake.
It's sort of panic-themed.
Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks.
I think I can see a little bit.
Gah!
Nope.
Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?
How cool is this?
She may be more organized than you, Twilight.
Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party?
Yeah?
Well, we've got the cure for that!
Yeah, Rarity.
Thanks for setting all this up.
Uh-huh.
Uh, only, you know, I didn't think mine was that scary!
So what?
Probably just a coincidence.
Uh, so Smokey gave us bad dreams.
No biggie.
Okay, okay, okay, I take it back!
That does sound bad!
Really bad!
What are you talking about?
This is my favorite dream!
Hyah!
Me either!
Yeah!
We're already on it!
I got you!
Come on!
If that Tantabus thing turns any more of this dream against us, we'll be too busy saving ponies to catch it!
And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world!
Oh, I think we'll know.
What the?
That's true, in Ponyville!
It's working!
Yeah!
If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!
Yeah.
Hey guys, how's it?
My bad.
Sorry I messed up your dress thingy.
I'm here for Princess Celestia's royal garden opening tomorrow.
Well, kind of exciting.
Technically, I'm not flying.
I'm just the lucky Reserve who was called in to be the backup flyer in case a Wonderbolt can't perform.
It is pretty sweet.
And I do get to stay in the castle, hang out with the Wonderbolts, and eat awesome food at the dinner tonight.
Speaking of the dinner, you're still coming, right?
Great!
See ya tonight!
Let's grab some grub!
No, it's broccoli!
Rarity!
Don't you know who this is?
It's Wind Rider!
You didn't let me finish!
He's a living legend.
He holds the Wonderbolt record in the Mustang Marathon!
Oh, heh, I'm nowhere near as good as you.
I mean, I'm fast, but I don't have the endurance to go long distances.
Not as nice as it is to meet you, sir.
I can't believe I just met Wind Rider!
Really?
That's incredible!
Guess I'll just watch Wind Rider being awesome from the sidelines, practice tomorrow is gonna be so boring.
You could!
They always let friends and family come watch practices!
Oops.
Heh, sorry about that.
Lemme help you clean that up.
See you tomorrow, Rarity!
Thanks for keeping me company, Rarity.
If you weren't here, well, I don't know who I'd be talking to right now.
Oh, no!
I hope her mom's okay!
L-Like, in the actual show?
I won't let you down, Soarin!
This is the best thing ever!
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
I'm gonna get to fly with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, 'cause I'm the bestest and I'm awesome and they know it!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh...
Why would anypony want that?
I would never do that to Spitfire!
Why would you think it was me?
We were room neighbors in the castle!
Yeah, but I didn't mean anything.
I was asleep at midnight, having this totally amazing dream.
There I was at the arena flying with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, like I've always wanted to?
ah, eh, never mind.
Not helping.
I understand.
But how am I gonna prove I didn't send a letter that I didn't send?
Yeah, what's with the getup?
That's not good.
What are you doing?
They're gonna kick me out of the Wonderbolts unless we solve this thing!
Come on, Rarity, we don't have all day!
Where were you on the night of last night at midnight?
A likely story.
What are you tryin' to say?
Ugh, who cares how it was decorated?
Do you?
I mean, even I think I'm guilty at this point!
I really did want to fly in that show!
What if I wrote that note when I was asleep?
Do you know what I do when I sleep?
Because I sure don't!
What do you mean, raspy?
I can't believe you're talking fashion at a time like this!
Trust you?
You've spent more time changing clothes than trying to help me!
I'm doomed!
Rarity, I can't believe you would accuse Wind Rider of framing me!
He's a living legend, for pony's sake!
Peh!
What evidence could you possibly have?
But why, Wind Rider?
Was it because I took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it?
Really?
That is so not cool.
And I thought you were the coolest Wonderbolt ever.
Until now.
That's not what being a Wonderbolt is all about.
No wonder she's been gone so long.
Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring!
But Spitfire shouldn't have to miss this!
I'm gonna get her!
Then there's no time to lose!
Rare, I couldn't have done it without you.
And I'm sorry I doubted you.
But why didn't you tell me what you were doing?
Thank you for believing in me, even when I was doubting you.
I'm some friend, huh?
I'll get my chance one day.
Would I?
Woo-hoo!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, aww yeah...
Coming!
We have so got this.
I'm gonna go sign us in.
Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh?
I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you.
Why don't I just let you finish signing in?
But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion!
Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play!
Okay, hot stuff!
What's our move on the grape squish?
Apple toss?
Egg carrying?
Nice jump, Scoot!
Hah!
Looks like we win, squirt!
Uh, how did you know all that?
So, you said you needed our help with something?
Sweet posters!
Is that Smash Fortune?
Totally understandable.
Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise!
So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual?
Come on.
Whatever it is, you can tell us!
We're best friends!
Friends!
Friends!
Friends!
Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us?
I'm starving!
Ughhh!
I need a hayburger in my belly right now!
I hope it's something about eating lunch!
Wow, you're scary good at this, Pinkie Pie.
What happened?
Seriously?
You?
Out?
Tonight?
Hey, Fluttershy, where's your costume?
Oh, yeah.
Good luck beating that, Fluttershy!
Awesome!
Just, like, ninety per?
Her scaring us?
You're being serious.
Did she just say tea party?
Uh, what are those?
It's a good thing Fluttershy isn't here because she would never be able to handle this!
Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me.
What do you mean?
Didn't you help plan this?
RUUUUUUUUUN!
I can barely move!
It's like glue!
It was you the whole time?
It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of!
You came up with all of this?
Yeah!
Sorry.
Me and Discord are just messin' around.
Like we do.
Sneaky snake!
Good one, Discord!
Kind of an inside joke from this weekend.
You wouldn't really get it unless you were there.
Cool.
Well, uh, catch you later, Twilight!
I don't know if I can get it out!
It's too funny!
It was a hose snake.
Super deadly.
And it chased after us!
A snake!
Uh, does it really matter?
Yeah, Twilight.
If you don't get it by now, I don't think you're ever gonna get it.
Yeah, and I'll bet they'll be just as hissssss-terical!
You're kidding.
Yeah!
And to top it off, you're accusing us of not being able to tell he was up to something!
What do you take us for?
It's funny if you were there.
And, you know, not try to make us recreate everything that happened when you weren't around.
Come on, Discord, do we really have to spell it out for you?
Well, spill it, Pinkie!
The changelings attacked Ponyville!
We barely escaped with our lives!
The princess asked you a question!
And unless you wanna end up in the dungeon, you'll tell her what she wants to know!
I mean, I knew my rainboom was awesome, but I never thought all of Equestria depended on it!
Well, I think we should leave ASAP.
I don't want to miss the Crystalling!
And some kinda cool energy.
Um, Applejack, what is that?
Yeah, it's okay, But it's no Cloudsdale mobile!
Bam!
Well, I know all about super-strong flying!
Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic.
Take it easy!
Just pick whoever looks the most like honor guard material.
I can totally fly up there and bust those puppies!
No problem!
We're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside!
Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling isn't happening.
Come on, it's freezing out here!
Ugh!
What?
Heh.
Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit.
The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness.
Spitfire!
Heh.
Sorry.
Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts!
Come on, I'll introduce you!
You coming or what?
You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?
Where have you been?
Right.
Hiya, Scootaloo!
What's up?
Well, it's great that you guys are going to the show, Scoot, but I won't actually be performing in it.
Reservists aren't in the show unless one of the real Wonderbolts can't fly.
I'll probably be working crowd control or something.
A Reservist one, yeah.
Uh, anypony seen my wing balm?
I don't want to be stiff when I show up at Wonderbolt headquarters.
Heh.
Well, not much to tell, really.
Spitfire told me the Wonderbolts need me to go on tour with them.
Yeah.
Fire Streak decided to retire and teach full-time.
Cloudsdale Flight School will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there.
But guess who was at the top of the Reserve list.
I have to report to Wonderbolts headquarters this afternoon.
It's only two days 'til tour starts, and I need to learn the routine.
Pinkie, I'm not leaving Ponyville.
I just have to train for this show.
Luck?
Heh.
Save that for the rest of the team.
Now that my awesomeness has finally been recognized, the other Wonderbolts will have to keep up or eat my cloud trail!
Aw, you're right!
I mean, do I show up wearing sunglasses or not?
Sunglasses are automatically cool, but anypony can put them on.
Maybe I'd stand out more if I didn't.
0720, because there were twenty ponies in the original E.
Guard that became the Wonderbolts!
Built by Admiral Fairweather himself!
Uh, sure, but, nopony else is here.
Right, no problem!
Whoa!
Is that General Flash's cap?
Wow!
I mean, ha, cool.
Yes, ma'am!
I'll have all of the moves down by the end of the day!
Lookin' good!
Okay, you're about to take your first flight as an actual Wonderbolt.
No pressure.
Just gotta go out there and knock 'em off their hooves.
Okay, Wonderbolts, get ready to meet your most awesome member ever!
Huh?
Whooaaa!
Hey!
You guys buzzed me on purpose!
Yeah, well, I was just, testing you guys!
My name's not Crash!
Tough day?
Please.
If I can pull off a sonic rainboom, I can learn this routine.
I'll have it down cold tomorrow.
Probably even come up with a couple of improvements.
Yes, ma'am!
Oh, yeah?
Did you want some ideas on how to make the show extra-awesome?
My name's not Crash.
What?
Yeah.
It was somethin', all right.
Heh.
And I'd love to tell you, I really would, but I'm pretty beat.
You know, from all the, excitement of my big day?
What could be wrong?
I'm finally a Wonderbolt, which means everything has to be totally, perfectly awesome.
I told you, it's nothing!
I mean, maybe some of the Wonderbolts started calling me Rainbow Crash...
Well, I kinda sorta fell into a garbage can.
That's it!
I'm gonna stand out in a different way, just like you guys!
Goodbye, Rainbow Crash... hello, Captain Awesome!
Good morning, everypony!
Who's ready for a fantastic day of flying?
I know I am!
I just couldn't be more excited for the big show tomorrow.
Are you guys excited?
I'm excited!
Actually, I'm always excited!
Some ponies even call me Dynamic Dash!
Because I'm so full of energy all the time!
Well, of course I know that!
But the truth of the matter is, you should be excited!
It's the dream of near every little Pegasus pony to grow up and fly with the Wonderbolts!
And here you all are doin' it!
True!
Go ahead and call me Forthright Filly if you want.
But shee-yucks, I like to tell it like it is, and I believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work payin' off like this, because bein' a Wonderbolt is somethin' special!
You know, I was just reading about how dihedral wing angles can help increase stability in banking turns.
It made me think that pre-flight checklists could really help increase our efficiency, so I went ahead and made them for everypony!
I'm always finding so much interesting information in books.
In fact, a lot of ponies call me Reading Rainboom.
I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help because I care about all of the Wonderbolts oh-so much.
Yessiree, just call me Care Mare.
Um, but if you're busy now, I can just come back later, Or, you know, not at all...
Okay.
I must tell you how much I just love these uniforms.
Why, ever since I was a foal, I've admired the mixture of bold lines and classic contours.
They don't call me Rainbow Fash for nothing.
The Fash is for Fashion.
I was just, you know, trying to show everypony all the awesome ways I can contribute to the 'Bolts.
Yes, ma'am.
Crash?
Couldn't you just put my regular name on it?
Clipper?
If I don't come up with something unforgettable to add to the routine, I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash for the rest of my life!
Perfect!
Hey, can I borrow Scootaloo?
Oh, heh, I just needed some help and figured the president of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club was the right pony for the job!
Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing, uh, official Reserve stuff.
But don't worry!
With Scootaloo's help, everything's gonna be awesome.
Better than awesome!
Gotta go.
I just need a small favor from you that's really gonna make this show something special.
Now, the Wonderbolts are gonna fly over this ridge right before the finale of the show.
I'll fly by last, and when I signal you, you zip up the ramp on your scooter and kick the storm cloud into my path!
That kick will shoot off a lightning bolt right behind me, making me look totally awesome!
And then I'll do some incredible Rainbow Dash flying with it to create the coolest, show-stoppingest, lightning-tastic light show anypony has ever seen!
Uh-huh!
It's gonna be so awesome!
And nopony will ever call me Rainbow Crash after this!
Oh, gotta go!
Be ready for me, okay, Scootaloo?
I'm so sorry.
I know, and I'm ready for whatever punishment you want.
You guys were right to call me Rainbow Crash.
I've always been a standout flyer, but since I joined the Wonderbolts, I've only stood out for making mistakes.
It's been my dream my whole life, but, I guess maybe I'm not Wonderbolt material after all.
Uh, I?
But, you guys all called me Rainbow Crash.
Uh, 'cause you're as fast as a ship?
Huh.
Whoa!
That is so much worse than Crash.
So does this mean I'm, still on the team?
I promise!
I spent my whole life trying to be a standout flyer, but now that I'm a Wonderbolt, it's time to be okay with fitting in!
No, ma'am.
I'm doing great, thanks!
Nah.
This mess is my responsibility, and I've gotta clean it up myself.
And after this, Spitfire's got me cleaning the Wonderbolts' compound for the next month.
Duh!
Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
What do you need?
Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve.
Where did they get that crazy idea?
Dangerous?
It's awesome!
It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!
I think you might be missing the point.
Sweet!
Hey, Merry.
Oh, no, the eggnog was awesome, Flutterholly, I'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful Hearth's Warming Eve is.
She said Hearth's Warming Eve is just an excuse to party, and we would all be better off spending time working to make Equestria a better place.
Ponies working hard, learning, and using their abilities for the benefit of Equestria.
Boss?
Wow.
Dragon toenail?
Uh, thanks?
You kidding?
No one's ever given me dragon toenail before!
It's awesome!
Now come get some eggnog!
Come on!
If we hurry, we can get there before the paper's even delivered to Rarity's house!
I still can't believe we all just blabbed everything that happened to that reporter!
Um, I have an idea.
How 'bout we don't read it?
After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right?
Wait, are you writing this down?
I wish we were having as much fun as they are.
Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping.
I mean, how lame is that?
Nope.
Leave the hiring to me.
What would she do without us?
Huh.
Lemme think.
Darlings, I'm absolutely doomed, doomed, doomed!
Heh, I sound just like her!
Hey, you're not writing this down, are you?
Rarity For You is only hiring the best of the best.
And to me, that means the fastest.
Now, uh, before we begin, uh, Am I doing this right?
What would Rarity want?
New plan!
Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is?
Are you sure?
I don't know the first thing about clothes.
Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's clothes or not.
This chair?
Not clothes.
I don't know which one of you to hire!
Just, keep guessing fabrics!
I asked a lot of fabric questions.
Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do get speed.
And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers Rarity's gonna have.
So, first one to the river and back gets the job!
It's a race!
Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out!
Honestly, they were all pretty slow.
But they finished the race.
Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I did.
So, I hired them all!
What?
Oh, they're totally not.
At least, not the froufrou kind.
Yeah, I, uh, I think I tweaked something at Wonderbolts practice the other day.
I just came in for a deep tissue sports massage.
I-I'm pretty sure that wasn't what I signed up for.
And it seems like you're really busy today anyway!
I'll just come back tomorrow.
Uh, see you two later!
Have fun!
But put me down for the same thing.
Thanks for letting me know there was an opening.
I don't know if I could make it without my pampered muscle massage.
Oh, absolutely!
Sometimes a girl just has to pamper herself, am I right?
Hey!
I was just, uh, uh, Uh...
I suppose I could take it.
You know, for you ponies.
And it was super awesome of you to invite me too!
Things have been so busy with the Wonderbolts lately, it's great to get a chance to relax someplace quiet.
I'll say!
Remember when he was convinced square clouds were gonna be the next big thing?
Wait, you don't mean?
Ugh.
Oh, this ought to be good.
Zeph was just telling me all about the ins and outs of mane therapy school.
You know it's the middle of the day, right?
Same old Zeph.
I know you weren't expecting to see your brother, but you've been kind of quiet, even for you.
We just had lunch with Fluttershy's parents, and you'll never guess who showed up.
Zephyr Breeze.
She's a bit peeved.
So, where's Zeph gonna go now?
Are you kidding?
One hundred percent!
Okay, maybe like seventy percent.
You know what?
I totally forgot that I promised to help Pinkie Pie, sprinkle, something.
That's right, Zeph!
You're coming with me!
We're going to Wonderbolts Headquarters.
And I am gonna give you a job so simple and straightforward, not even you can weasel your way out of it!
And the second you try, I'm gonna zap you with a storm cloud!
Got it?
Aw, cheer up, Fluttershy.
I know it was hard, but you did the right thing.
You couldn't let Zephyr pull the same stuff on you that he's always pulled on your folks!
I know he needs to learn to do things for himself, but...
Actually, I don't think he'd make it through the night.
It's noon.
But then you won't ever do anything.
You think he can do it?
And it looks exactly like it's supposed to.
So, Zeph, now that you've accomplished this, what's next?
Thanks for dinner, Mr and Mrs Shy!
It was great as usual.
Huh, Heh.
That's great.
Hah, awesome!
Well, don't stop there!
You read, I pack!
That's the deal!
Don't worry.
I'll make sure AK Yearling signs your book.
I can't believe she's gonna be there!
She never goes to conventions!
Which, I guess, will be cool for all those other fanponies.
But since you and I know AK Yearling personally, and we know that she's secretly Daring Do herself, it's no big deal.
This convention will be fun, but it's nothing to get too excited about.
So excited!
No thanks.
Did that already.
Ahhh.
They even put the tiles in the right order.
Nice costume.
Thanks.
I am so glad I ran into you.
Even though I knew the convention would be totally awesome, it's more fun when you're with someone who really knows Daring Do.
That's weird.
We've only done stuff from the first trilogy.
After lunch, we should probably start working our way back through the other books.
Of course there are.
Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers, Daring Do and the Many Faces of?
Why?
What?
I know for a fact that everything in every one of those books is one hundred percent possible!
Why would you even come to this convention if you hate Daring Do so much?
Okay, now I know you're crazy.
AK Yearling is awesome, and every Daring Do book that comes out is better than the last!
That's okay, because I could never be friends with somepony who's so focused on things being possible that he's willing to turn his back on the coolest hero of all time!
Fine!
Look, just tell AK Yearling that Rainbow Dash is here, and I need her help to convince a know-it-all pony that everything Daring Do's ever done actually happened!
I gotta talk to you.
It's an emergency!
What?
But there is a pony downstairs who thinks everything you've written after the first trilogy is totally unrealistic and terrible.
And I need you to help me prove to him that it's all totally possible.
Whoa!
Yes!
Sounds like another awesome Daring Do adventure!
But, what are you doing here?
How can I help?
Got it!
Does a pony who only likes your first trilogy qualify as suspicious?
Heh, just checking.
Ugh!
Sorry, Quibble, I've got more important things to do than argue with a pony who thinks awesome means unrealistic.
Ugh!
Obviously, her wing wasn't broke?
Caballeron!
No-no-no-no!
Caballeron is right there!
Daring Do told me that Caballeron came to this convention to steal the Amulet of Culiacan, and I just saw him and his henchponies come this way!
Caballeron!
Hah!
What do you have to say now, Quibble?
What?
Look around us!
Henchponies, Caballeron, the jungle it took forever to get to?
This is the real deal!
The Griffon's Lock!
They're not gonna listen to me.
They abducted us both.
It doesn't matter.
We'll never solve the Griffon's Lock before they get back.
Okay, that was pretty good.
Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do!
Fine.
Let's just say this is a Daring Do Adventucation.
The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it.
So just follow me, and I'll lead you out.
Deal?
Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you.
Is it too realistic for you?
Wouldn't want that on a Daring Do adventure, would we?
Hah!
How's that for not possible?
Yeah.
If you read that in a book, you might even think it was unrealistic.
You'll never get away with this!
Finally!
Ugh!
Uh, Quibble?
Whoa!
Um, maybe you should let Daring Do figure it out?
Yeah.
But, he's usually right.
Uh, The way out is totally covered!
How are we gonna get out of here?
We won't be fast enough!
We'll never make it!
If Quibble says go over him, we go over him!
You said go over him!
He's a fan.
What about you?
So, What?
How can you?
Okay, Well...
I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can!
You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself.
In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way.
Heh.
Definitely friends.
Uh, Quibble?
Are you kidding?
Of course I'll help with the Applewood Derby!
I want you to have as much fun as I did when I was a filly!
Sure!
Practically every town in Equestria has one!
I still remember racing my cloud cart...
Heh, obviously!
Help you?
I'm all over it!
I've got tons of ideas.
The blueprint for my derby cart, of course!
I'll have to change it a little, 'cause this race is on roads, not on clouds.
But trust me, your cart is gonna be amazing!
Hey, I'd get up in the middle of the night if it means my cart crosses that finish line first and wins fastest!
Our carts.
Scootaloo, where have you been?
I've only got 'til noon to make the fastest cart ever!
Exactly!
It's all about speed!
You've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, so we might as well get there first, right?
Hey, I left a bunch of paint cans by the road.
Bring them up here, would ya?
Nothing as fun as painting racing stripes on the winning cart!
The race is about to start, Scootaloo!
You better shake a leg if you wanna ride in the winning cart!
It still counts as a win if I push my cart across, right?
But why didn't you say anything?
And we probably could have done a better job of listening to you.
Um, how do you feel about a do-over?
And it's probably best keeping all the grown-ups on the sidelines.
But, what are we supposed to do now?
Seriously!
This is the most relaxed I've been all day.
Go, Scootaloo, go!
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
Uhh, I mean...
This is the life.
Right, ponies?
Gotcha!
Nope.
You're too easy.
You're scared of everything.
Boo.
I mean, how could you not appreciate that?
See?
Everypony likes a good prank!
They're just jokes!
Lazy?
And I can do funny.
Fine!
If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get.
Gotcha!
Ha-ha!
How's that for effort?
Still think I'm lazy?
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Boo!
Pinkie, hey!
I actually have something totally important to tell you!
Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?
Here.
Have a cookie.
So, I got to thinking, why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?
You don't even know what it is yet!
Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever!
I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane.
And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies.
When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash!
Ha-ha!
It's gonna be so awesome!
What?
Stop?
No way!
This prank is happening, Pinkie!
And it's gonna be hilarious!
Pinkie, what's the deal?
I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies.
But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself!
Uh, Pinkie?
Wow.
Your face is still pretty rainbowed.
Uh, no.
I just told you, I used them all for the prank.
Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town.
Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me!
It's gonna be so awesome!
C'mon, you don't wanna miss it!
Aah!
On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest.
All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?
Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me.
Come on!
You heard her!
Every house in Ponyville!
Any minute now.
Huh?
Oh, uh, nothing!
Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten?
I mean, it's still early, right?
You think?
Huh, Maybe you're right.
I'll go check.
Okay.
Definite cookie-eating happening.
But, where is everypony?
They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now...
They should all be running out into the streets!
Unless everypony went to bed early...
Pinkie?
The whole town got the cookies, and now everypony is shut up in their houses!
You don't think there's something wrong with the joke cookies, do you?
Mrs Cake!
Phew!
Have you seen Pinkie?
I was thinking I might have something to do with her not feeling great.
Uh, Mrs, Cake...
Uh, I can see you're busy!
I'll come back!
Uhh!
Twilight!
You gotta come with me to Sugarcube Corner!
Something's going on with the Cakes!
Well, not something exactly.
I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies...
Oh, no!
Fluttershy?
Don't touch those!
Come on!
We gotta get outta here!
There's no time!
You have to follow me!
I don't want the cookies?
But they do!
I'll explain later.
Come on!
Did we lose them?
I think it's something in the cookies.
Uh, unless there, is...
Cover the windows!
Okay!
So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead!
I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine.
No, no!
Stay away!
They're making you sick!
You don't want these!
Nngh!
Please!
Stop!
I never meant for this to happen!
It was just a harmless prank!
It was supposed to be funny!
But this isn't funny at all!
What?
Wait, What's happening?
So, you're, not sick?
None of you are?
This, was all, a prank?
Well, I don't think it's very funny!
And I'm the one that got pranked!
I was really scared!
I thought I made everypony sick!
You can't just go around?
Yeah!
Ohhh.
I see what you did there.
I guess I did.
I'm sorry, everypony.
I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel.
Totally!
You ponies pulled off an amazing prank!
I'll have to work extra hard to top it!
Gotcha.
Heh.
If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!
No way!
Did you see Big Mac's sword?
I totally want in!
Hey, Applejack!
Whatcha doin'?
Uh, distance bucking?
What for?
What?
That's ridiculous!
Nopony beats Ponyville!
I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back!
Oh, yeah!
I am so there!
I've just got one question.
Uh, what's buckball?
So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever.
Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action!
It's got it all!
Yeah, I'm kind of an expert.
Well, it's a new game.
I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert.
Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team.
All we need is a unicorn.
That's where you two come in.
Uh, obviously.
You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team.
And the Pegasus is on defense.
She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team.
Just give it a little kick, Pinkie.
All right.
Now let's see which of you has what it takes.
When the ball comes towards you, catch it.
Coming your way, Pinkie!
And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.
Hiya!
Nope.
Aaaand, This didn't go how I thought it would.
Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?
Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa!
Uh, you two, obviously!
Mm-hmm.
Me, too.
I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition.
But you still flew rings around me.
Well, duh!
You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville.
And, more importantly, us!
So let's hop to it!
Snails already has a head start on you!
Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down!
It's all about ball control.
Ready?
Come on!
Faster!
You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?
Come on!
Push!
Push!
Push!
Faster!
Come on!
Come on!
I don't know.
They mopped the field with us before.
Or a whole lot of it.
Heh.
We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.
Totally!
Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team!
I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you!
If that doesn't get you in the zone, I don't know what will!
Hey!
You two are supposed to be in the zone!
I don't get it.
They're naturals!
Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?
What?
That's crazy talk!
Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus!
And?
Get ready to totally smash the competition, and?
and, none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?
What do we do now?
Pinkie?
Fluttershy?
You don't have to play against Appleloosa.
But, we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice.
So we need you to play just one more time.
Don't worry about it.
Applejack and I just need a little workout.
No, thanks.
Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are.
I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't.
And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out.
And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!
You guys are amazing!
Hah!
Good game?
We bucked the hooves right off of you!
Uh, I don't know if we can chillax properly in the castle.
We need very specific conditions for optimal chillaxing.
Heh.
Shows what you know about chillaxing.
Let me do some location scouting.
Ugh.
There is nowhere to chillax in this castle!
We're gonna have to set up somewhere else.
Wow.
That pony really needs to chillax.
Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer!
Yes, Starlight Glimmer.
Yes, Starlight Glimmer.
Ugh, tell me about it.
Well, here's a friendship lesson for ya, don't cast spells on your friends!
That was a pretty good apology.
Uh, I'll come and get those storm clouds out of the bathroom.
Nope.
Quiet.
Hey!
She completes the lesson when I say she completes it.
So less learning and more chillaxing!
Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!
I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!
But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.
See you gals later!
Huh?
Oh, the map!
Hey, Twilight!
So where am I going?
The Crystal Mountains?
Vanhoover?
Here?
Please say here.
Awesome!
Does that mean there's bad news?
I was just there!
Ahem.
I remember when she said that to me.
Official friendship business.
Adorable.
They're so full of hope and competition.
Eh, their technique could use some work, though.
Nah.
I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.
We can?
Count us in!
Maybe for you.
I practically fell asleep when I went through this.
Tell you what.
I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake!
Good one, Twilight.
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session!
But you can call us T-Sparks and The Dashinator!
Just kidding.
Who said that?
What's your name?
Huh.
That's pretty impressive.
But you'll have to in the solo trials.
Yup.
It's a part of your final evaluation.
That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer.
Wake up newbies!
Class is in session!
Yeah, nopony fell asleep.
What?
I'm not a student!
Me or Twilight?
Probably Twilight.
Tell you what.
It's almost time for your freestyle training.
Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?
But did you see Vapor Trail?
Her wing was under his.
I think she gave him a boost.
Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
Of course not!
Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence!
You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!
Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!
Will do!
Hey, you did great.
You're a really strong flyer.
You've been doing great!
Not without you.
And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.
You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it.
Then we have to find a way to help both of you.
Yes!
Hah-hah!
I love being right!
Okay, here's what we do.
Sky needs to build his strength.
Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff.
We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.
Hah.
You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.
Oh, you were awesome!
That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.
Gyuh, Do you think they're still mad?
Yeah, they're still mad.
No, it's my fault.
It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you.
He wasn't even trying!
Oh, no.
He's lost his confidence.
Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it.
We really messed up, huh?
You know, you're really good.
You're lead pony material.
But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine.
That is what you want, right?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Come with me.
Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight.
She thought she was helping you.
Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen!
Please pick the second option.
I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me.
Okay, let's not get carried away.
Hey, I heard that!
You're telling me.
Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejack?
You've gotta be kidding me!
I was just there!
Trust me.
You are a totally different pony now.
I mean, you were pretty awful.
What?
She was!
It's a compliment!
Hello, ponies.
We need Rarity and Applejack.
Very important friendship business.
Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed.
Well, she definitely has one.
I mean when has Twilight not had a plan?
Well, we are awesome.
But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria.
Hah!
Griffons barely like each other!
We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships!
So get your quill ready, bub!
You're gonna have to write down a new record!
Just put the gem in!
We're trying to set a record here!
I've seen those symbols!
Over here!
I'm not.
I knew we were the best!
Gah!
Did we do it?
Aw, nuts!
I have a coupon!
Hah!
Yeah!
What is it, Fluttershy?
Spill!
Pretty awesome.
How about putting an awesome flying course for the birds right there?
I was born to make thunder!
How?
Where's it coming from?
Oh, no.
I guess they're with me.
Mom, Dad.
So, good, to see you.
Uh, how did you know I was here?
Moooom!
Mom, please!
They don't wanna hear about your bath time!
Dad, hold it together.
We're in public.
Okay, yeah!
Uh, great practice!
I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!
Dad!
Could you give us a sec?
Yeah.
You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents!
Or talked to Twilight or something!
Not just shown up!
Ugh!
It's just my parents and I have a delicate relationship.
I love them very much, and we're really close, but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!
They can be a little bit, embarrassing.
Yeah, really!
And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!
Uhhhh, we didn't.
Stop!
This is ridiculous!
Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive!
This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt!
You're just, too much!
Yes!
The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?
Well, I'm tired of it!
I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do!
I think you should leave.
Scootaloo, you don't understand!
Scootaloo, wait!
I know I wasn't myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents!
That's exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!
Can I tell you something?
Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your wings because this could rock you to your very core.
Believe it or not, there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything.
See this picture?
Granted, I was the youngest pony in the senior competitive circuit.
Most other ponies my age were still in the Junior Flappers' Club.
I thought it was utterly mortifying having my parents cheer me on even when I lost!
But then, when I started to win competitions, which didn't take very long, by the way, things got even worse!
Being the best came with consequences.
Very loud, very embarrassing consequences.
Yeah, right!
Name one!
I am pretty good at napping.
I can fall asleep anywhere.
Huh?
You're right.
I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am!
And I took them for granted.
I gotta make this right.
I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help.
That is, if you're willing to help me after I acted like that.
Windy Whistles and Bow Hothoof, please be seated for a super private Wonderbolt event!
Mom and Dad, welcome to the, I Love My Parents and I'm Sorry That I Took Them for Granted and I Know That They Made Me Who I Am Today So I Really Wanna Make It Up to Them, event.
Enjoy!
Thanks for doing this.
Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm your biggest fan.
Yeah!
Greatest report giver of all time!
Nopony says that.
Do they?
You got it!
We're not playing that!
Or it's super-easy 'cause I'm awesome.
I'll say!
There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons.
Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them.
I-I don't even know what this is.
What can I say?
When I learn something, I learn it hard.
I found Pinkie's page.
Remember this one from when I helped Daring Do?
Never underestimate the power of friends who always got your back.
I'm awesome.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, good idea.
Maybe it's time to call it a day.
Hey, here's a great idea!
Why don't you guys talk to Twilight for a while?
So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else.
Again?
Haven't we already covered that one?
A couple dozen times?
Uh, It's just that I, uh, really need to get those storm clouds back in their, pens.
You think you've got problems?
I know I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am!
Uh, Rarity?
What are you wearing?
So that just happened.
There are worse things than not being able to do anything without being told I'm awesome.
Mmmm!
These berries look good enough to eat!
What?
Don't worry, kid.
You've got a big sister this time.
Follow me, everypony!
Ugh.
You want stories?
I've got a ton of stories!
Spoiler alert, they're all about me and how awesome I am!
I got this!
Eh, heh.
It was no biggie.
It'd be impossible for one pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava.
I mean, even I couldn't do that.
Good story, Applejack!
Even if it wasn't about me.
Mistmane?
Isn't she the old wrinkly sorceress with the flower?
Ugh!
These Fly-ders won't quit!
What do they want from us now?
What?
Now those bugs can't get in!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Scootaloo.
You're focusing on the wrong things.
Close.
I have a story.
Practically.
It's about my favorite legend, Flash Magnus!
Oh, these were definitely the big, scary, mean kind!
But not too scary.
You can sit closer to me if you want.
A long time ago, before the Wonderbolts were even founded, Flash Magnus was a lowly cadet in the Royal Legion.
And the Legion needed to fly over the Dragon Lands to get to their comrades on the other side.
But as they got closer to the dragons, the dragons attacked!
Scootaloo, if you just hang in there?
I said if you just hang in there, I promise you'll like the ending.
So, like I was saying, Flash Magnus and the Royal Legion tried to get past the dragons, but the dragons wouldn't let them!
Flash Magnus and a few other cadets were separated from the battalion.
He managed to get away, but the dragons captured his friends and took them back to their lair!
But you can out-think them.
While Flash Magnus bravely flew for his life, Commander Ironhoof was able to get his soldiers back.
Flash Magnus flew like the wind, faster than the dragons!
But he knew he couldn't do this forever.
Luckily, he had a plan.
He led the dragons straight into a storm that the Legion had planted!
One taste of the lightning, and the dragons retreated.
Flash Magnus' plan worked!
Told ya!
He always inspired me to be my brave and awesome self.
Tch!
You guess?
Come on, I'm just like him!
Scootaloo, just remember the story.
Gotta be brave like me and Flash Magnus, okay?
I hear water!
Eh, seems like a bunch of boring hooey to me.
Snooze.
Another day, another parasprite hype story.
What?
Let me see that!
No, this!
It can't be true...
No, Pinkie!
I can't believe that the greatest author and secret pony adventurer of all time, AK Yearling, is retiring!
Pinkie, the AK Yearling I know would never quit and retire out of the blue!
Something could be really wrong, and we need to make sure she's okay!
Of course not!
But that wouldn't hurt either.
Now, come on!
Uh, maybe she's not home.
Maybe she went to the editor-in-chief of the Ponyville Chronicle to correct the misprint they've made.
How do you know?
I knew it!
Something is wrong!
What?
it's us!
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie!
Your friends!
Oh, no.
Did somepony ransack your cottage again and steal some ancient, mysterious relic that's the key to saving all of Equestria?
Then is somepony blackmailing you and forcing you to retire?
So you're just quitting and moving away?
Why, would, you, do, that?
Oh, really?
Author AK Yearling announced yesterday that the next adventure novel in her popular series, 'Daring Do and the Curse of the Pharaoh's Tomb', will be her last.
Yearling looks forward to her retirement.
That doesn't explain anything!
It just says you're giving up writing stories.
But most ponies don't know that you actually are Daring Do and that the stories are real.
So what you're really saying is that you're giving up being Daring Do, but you're not saying why!
Yeah.
We just came to make sure you're all right.
That's really why we wanted to find out what's going on.
Dare Or Scare: Local Rogue Daring Do Involved In Frightful Fiasco?
So all we have to do is go down there and explain to these ponies that none of this stuff is true.
Come on!
For every one pony who's upset, there must be at least a hundred that know you're a hero!
Well, why don't we go visit this village Som, am, u, a and see for ourselves?
And what a heap of rotten apple cores these articles are!
I know so!
Let's go!
This is so cool!
It looks just like that village in your last book where Daring Do recovers the Doomed Diadem from the Wild Bunch Gang who chase after her through the desert!
Daring Do thwarts Ahuizotl's evil plot to separate the Sister Crown Relics.
And if it wasn't for her, the region would be cursed with eternal night, and the entire town of Somnambula would have sunk into the ground!
Watch this.
Hiya there, mister!
I was hoping you could tell me about a pony named Daring Do.
I hear she's an awesome adventure-pony hero.
What?
Daring Do is the exact opposite of a menace!
Come on, A.
So we picked a bad example.
That was just one angry pony.
Come on!
We gotta follow her!
But we have to convince her that ponies do appreciate her!
As her friend, I have to make sure she believes that.
Look, Pinkie!
It's the Get On Inn!
Daring Do stays here all the time in her adventures.
Which means there must be ponies here who love Daring Do!
Maybe they can help us.
Come on, Why not?
But?
No, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.
Daring Do was trying to save everypony from the curse of the Doomed Diadem of Xilati.
And she was only in a rush because she had to get the crown back to the Tiara of Teotlale before the curse took effect.
Chapter seventeen.
Hmmm, Listen, AK.
After a good night's sleep, we're going to fix all of this.
I promise.
Of course it will!
All I have to do is go up there and explain to everypony how wrong they all are.
Daring Do would never steal anything!
And okay, she destroyed your statue, but it was because she was trying to save you all from Ahuizotl!
Ahuizotl?
He's about yea big?
Long neck?
Itty-bitty face?
Weird claw thingy on his tail?
Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten away with the Doomed Diadem, your entire village would have been swallowed up!
And that's a lot worse than losing some crummy old statue!
Who?
Wow.
I had no idea how special the statue was to you.
Somnambula sounds like a pretty cool pony.
But I bet if she were here, she'd tell you how cool Daring Do is too, because they've both fought to protect this town!
Hey, buddy!
What did Daring Do ever do to you to deserve all this?
Caballeron?
But I-I didn't mean to?
Help!
Somepony help!
Somepony!
Anypony!
Pinkie Pie?
Daring Do?
Is that you?
And I'm kinda hoping you ponies will untie me before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!
Are you kidding?
That, was, awesome!
And if something bad happens that you didn't intend, you shouldn't give up hope or lose faith in yourself.
Maybe, No problem!
This'll do the trick.
Just you wait!
Yes!
Nailed it!
You saw her mane, right?
Yeah!
And we're here to remind you how awesome you are, mane or no mane!
A friend who stuck by us, no matter what!
Awesome!
I don't know why you were so upset.
Your mane looks awesome!
While you were shining from the inside out, Photo Finish took a few pictures.
My seventy-third training session?
That's specific.
Whaaa?
You didn't have to do this.
Whoa!
What's that?
Huh.
Guess it was nothing.
But wow, heh.
This pie is the best I've ever had!
Mmm!
Is that cinnamon?
Really?
Oh, that's so great!
But I need to go change.
A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet.
Heh.
His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again.
Do you mind if I take this pie with me?
Heh.
Thanks.
Another pie!
Thank you so much!
Whoa!
What's that?
Huh.
Guess it was nothing.
Heh-heh.
Awesome!
Three lemon meringues?
Uh, Hey, what's that over there?
Oh, never mind.
Heh.
Great pies!
Thank you!
No way!
Check that out!
Oh, sorry.
Guess it was nothing.
Mmm!
But that custard was everything!
Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!
And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!
Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty!
Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
W-W-What's happening?
Ugh.
I've never heard of Wake Your Friends Up Day.
What's the first most important part?
Uh, Well, I'm sorry I forgot about Wake Your Friends Up Day.
Let me make it up to you.
Here!
What do you mean where did it go?
Heh-heh.
Mmm-mmm.
Okay, this is getting a little out of hoof.
I haven't even trained yet.
Pinkie, look out!
Pinkie!
Are you okay?
The pie was delicious!
You just get better!
Don't worry, I got ya!
You gotta be more careful, okay?
Uh, Thanks!
I can't wait to eat all these pies!
Delicious!
You did it again, Pinkie!
Are you okay?
You seem to be staring more than usual.
You sure you don't have to blink?
Well, Do I want to take a big bite or a small bite, I just don't know, Or maybe medium?
No, no, no.
Definitely not medium.
Ahhhh, Do you have any milk?
Ah, never mind.
Your pies are just too good to resist.
Uh, everything okay, Pinkie?
What are you talking about?
That's crazy!
What do you think I did?
Somehow make them all disappear into thin air?
Okay.
So maybe I made one of them disappear into thin air.
What?
I, uh, I-I just wanted to share these amazing pies with the folks of Cloudsdale!
So I, uh, I was trying to send them up via, balloon mail.
Well, obviously that's because, I have amnesia!
I've been brainwashed!
I-It's Opposite Day?
Laser eyes?
What?
I can explain!
She won't listen to me.
She won't let me apologize.
I feel terrible.
Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head.
Is it my fault that I don't like pies?
And not just Pinkie's pies.
All pies!
I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her.
Oh, but I, You're right.
I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place.
Wait!
That's it!
I know how I can make it up to her!
Pinkie Pie, wait!
I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong.
And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle.
I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?
Of course you do.
The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong.
So to make up for it, I made this pie for you.
Well, I guess I made it for me.
To eat in front of you.
Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!
Yeah!
I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now.
So here I go.
Yeah, honestly, I have no idea.
Whoa!
What's that?
Huh.
Guess it was nothing.
Heh-heh.
Oh, never mind.
Heh.
Great pies!
No way!
Check that out!
Oh, sorry.
Guess it was nothing.
Mmm!
But that custard was everything!
Heh.
I know it does.
Yes!
Aw, shucks.
It was nothing.
Heh.
Cool.
H-How about this?
Your hugs are too tight.
Uh, So, the Pony of Shadows was really real?
Totally!
Uh, how long will all this research take, exactly?
Ugh.
I haven't spent this much time reading since the last Daring Do book came out.
I don't think anypony's seen any of this for a long time.
Whoa!
Uh, what just happened?
What exactly is so amazing?
You mean, like, stuff that belonged to them?
Flash Magnus' shield!
I can't believe Flash Magnus' shield ended up in the Dragon Lands.
Okay.
That was awesome.
Hey!
That's an ancient pony artifact!
It isn't yours.
No problem.
Wow.
You must be slow if all Spike had to do to win was fall down.
Doubt it.
Fine.
I'm pretty sure I could beat you anyway.
But with that heavy hunk of metal on your back, it'll be a snap.
Otherwise, we'd have brought this shield for nothing.
Um, where'd he go?
Oh, we've saved the world, Beardo.
And we can do it again.
What are we waiting for?
Isn't that a good thing?
Seriously!
She got her wings by finishing one of your spells!
So it's like a super-villain tracker!
No offense.
No problem.
We're used to banishing evil before breakfast.
Yeah!
Oh, it felt sooooo good to do that again!
The pirates!
They were pretty awesome!
Uh, once they decided not to throw us overboard.
It's too much.
Too much!
Not your dress!
This!
Teaching?
They're gonna think I'm an egghead!
Call me Professor Egghead.
I'm in!
Grandpa Gruff?
What are you doing here?
Okay, break it up!
That's because we're terrible teachers!
Face it.
This school isn't gonna work.
I don't look like that, do I?
Because my students are gone!
Uh, g-gone somewhere else!
Doing a loyalty lesson!
And-and I was just going to grab, uh, this pencil!
Because they need it.
Wherever they are.
Which I know, 'cause, I'm the teacher!
Come on, Twilight!
You can't sit around in the boring dark all day!
What?
No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever.
Totally!
Uh, how?
right now!
So, what are you waiting for?
Get your student and let's go!
Do you need me to do the whole apology and explanation thing again?
Okay.
Ooh!
Or went undercover!
He must be taking all that stuff to the other students!
We've gotta follow him!
Oh, yeah!
With class run my way, it'll be two hundred and twenty percent cooler.
Sorry, but we've got a Wonderbolts show coming up.
Well, let's find out!
Hey, Fluttershy?
Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?
What?
You are a small-town pony!
And your cottage isn't even in the town!
She kicked us out of the shop!
What customers?
Yeah!
I think you totally have what it takes.
Wait.
The fastest, most thrilling ride of all time?
Of course I have!
All right, you got me.
What is it?
It looks incredible!
'Til finally you climb to the highest peak on the rails!
Then drop towards the ground at lightning speed, before coming up to a screeching halt!
It's the coolest ride ever to exist in the history of Equestria!
I haven't.
The ride closes this week!
Forever!
But I can't go to Las Pegasus because I have to teach at Twilight's school.
I'm gonna miss out on the coolest rollercoaster of all time!
Unless, Can you cover my classes?
Really?
Awesome!
Surely you don't mean Granny Smith!
Look after them?
There is no way I'm going to Las Pegasus with a bunch of old, slow grannies!
Ugh, fine!
I'll go!
Why is this taking so long?
The Wild Blue Yonder's gonna close before we even get to Las Pegasus.
That could happen?
Make sure they get their naps.
Eat only soft foods.
Careful when dancing?
Don't get too excited?
Seriously?
Wait.
Then how am I supposed to go on the rollercoaster?
Yeah.
That'll happen.
Come on, come on, come on!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Argh!
Everypony okay in there?
They said they've heard the tree story!
The Wild Blue Yonder is in our hotel?
Uh, I bet you grannies are feeling super tired from your journey.
You know what would be really fun?
Relaxing in our room!
Come on.
Last one to the hotel is a rotten apple!
Let me get that for ya.
Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh!
There it is!
The best rollercoaster ever!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
That sounds a little too exciting.
Why don't we get you checked in first?
Uh, Granny Smith's right.
Let's not overdo it.
How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy Las Pegasus?
Uh, if you say so!
What?
They'll be in here sleeping the whole time I'm gone!
Quit judging me!
One ticket for the coolest rollercoaster of all time, please.
But, But, this line never ends!
Enjoy the ride.
Heh.
They didn't even know I left.
Whoa!
Aah!
They're gone!
Granny Smith!
Apple Rose!
Are you here?
Applesauce?
Goldie?
Oh, I'm the worst chaperone ever!
I know, I know!
Excuse me, sir.
Have you seen a group of old mares around here?
This place is huge!
They could be anywhere!
No way!
Goldie's totally got game!
Yeah!
Go, Goldie!
Huh?
Uh-oh!
Uh, mind if I try?
Whoops.
Guess I'm no good at this game.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm so glad I found you!
Everypony feeling okay?
Not too excited?
Good.
From now on, I'm not letting you grannies out of my sight.
Really?
Uh-huh, Come on, Granny.
You know you can't have those.
They're super crunchy.
How about some nice soft carrot soup, instead?
Wait.
I am fun!
So, what does everypony want to do tonight?
I was thinking go to our room and put on eye masks and earplugs?
Sounds kind of intense.
Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?
Ugh.
Dancing it is, then.
I'll be there.
Ugh!
Stop doing that!
Uh, that's probably enough dancing for now!
Right, Apple Rose?
So gross.
Oh, come on!
You said you were going back to the room after dancing!
So each pony could have some alone time?
Hey, where are you going?
Come back!
Release those grannies, right now!
Y-You were in danger!
I saw the water!
You were trapped!
What?
I'm so sorry, everypony.
The truth is, all I wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the Wild Blue Yonder.
I mean, it's why I came to Las Pegasus in the first place!
Applejack told me not to let you out of my sight, or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early.
Well, now it's too late.
I ruined your trip, and it's the last day ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder!
The line is so long, I'll never get to go on it.
Hey, what's so funny?
Like fancy suites and rollercoaster rides?
Um, yes!
This is amazing!
Isn't this amazing?
I'm sorry I misjudged you for being older ponies.
You mares are actually pretty cool.
Yeah, Granny?
Ha-ha!
Really?
I wouldn't miss it for anything!
Heads up!
Here comes our answer!
Celestia?
Starring in our play?
This is huge!
Our play is gonna be amazing!
I gotta tell everypony I know!
And even the ones I don't!
All right!
I just finished telling everypony to come to our play!
Yeah!
You should've seen how excited they got when they found out Celestia was in it!
They said they'd tell their friends, and then their friends would tell their friends!
Everypony in Equestria's gonna see this thing!
Uh, did I miss something?
That sun will never rise again.
Standing room only!
Did I do a good job of advertising for this thing or what?
Sorry.
Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
Yeah, right.
I got this one nailed.
Come on!
Yeah.
Me, neither.
Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.
I wouldn't say better.
Just a little more qualified.
No offense.
Totally!
This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever!
With me in charge, that is.
Whoa!
Yeah.
Good one.
Sweat?
Seriously?
That's supposed to be part of friendship?
Whatever.
Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity.
Emphasis on the slow.
Oh, yeah?
I just did!
Oh, sorry, can't hear you.
Too busy practicing my Teacher of the Month pose.
Oh, come on!
These students are totally gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!
Just bring it down already!
That's because you need a different teacher.
Follow me!
Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?
We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off.
That means you gotta move fast!
Any questions?
No time for 'em!
Get in the boat!
I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
We'll see about that.
Stroke!
Stroke!
Stroke!
Harder!
Put your backs into it, newbies!
When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack!
Now stroke!
Dig in, team!
We can still beat that record!
Left!
Left!
I can see the finish line from here!
Who cares about a few fish?
We'll just go around them!
Obviously not!
Because there goes our new speed record!
I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
Did too!
We are!
Mostly.
No way!
You're the one the students listen to.
Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.
Uh, long story.
But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.
Field trip?
Come on, Twilight.
We get it.
No more arguing.
Right, Applejack?
I was thinking right, unless you want to go left.
Because what makes you happy makes me happy.
But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.
Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?
No, no.
I insist.
We knew that.
All part of our plan.
Right, Applejack?
Only if you want to build a bridge.
Cooperation!
You are so right!
I-I'm building with your idea!
Branches!
End of story!
Why didn't I think of branches to begin with?
They're so, easy to work with?
Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to?
I can't get out!
Let me guess.
Bite-acudas?
Yeah.
No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
I thought you'd never ask.
Ocellus?
Now, that was a rescue!
Well, not all the time.
I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.
You were the one doing the angling!
So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly, There was a huge storm cloud in our way!
My genius happened!
I changed the routine on the fly!
And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!
Only the coolest thing ever!
I flew up and?
Hey!
I never told that story to my students before.
Scootaloo!
Without even having to study!
Hey!
Are we talking fun fun, or learning pretending to be fun?
Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?
We're looking for Fluttershy!
Hey!
I'm guessing some kind of curse?
Maybe poison joke?
Hey, hey, we're all friends here!
And I always have fun when we're all together.
Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.
Just getting there will take days!
A fake summons from the map?
And 'cause it looks cool.
Yeah, shouldn't you guys be getting ready to go?
If you miss that train, it's a really long walk.
And I don't think it was an accident.
Somepony was up here!
Might as well give up, whoever you are!
We got ya cornered!
I'll check the back door!
The back door's locked!
No way out!
One of you must have done this!
But, why would any of you want to sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?
Uh, what about me?
And once we find out who did it, just you wait!
We're gonna, We'll, What are we gonna do exactly?
Silverstream!
You're up!
Let's go!
Next!
Smolder, come with me.
Yona, Twilight's waiting for you.
We kinda guessed it was you.
But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.
Looks like they don't really need any extra lessons.
I thought I was the example.
And Rarity's weird fashion seasons.
She's working on her winter collection, and it's not even summer yet!
Aw, come on!
I even said shopping that time!
But I brought stuff for buckball to?
We've always been friends.
Well, no.
Not always.
But for like a super long time.
Uh, there was that time during the Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer Competition that I totally saved Rarity's life.
Game on!
Rarity!
You were supposed to be holding your bucket!
Good!
'Cause this time, I'm gonna try something new and super-intense!
Rarity!
Are you even paying attention?
But you have to catch the ball!
Oh, forget it.
She's never gonna understand the point of this game.
Buckball time is over!
Uh, isn't that what you want them to be?
That doesn't make any sense.
Unless you like tripping with every step, heels on a horse are pretty useless.
Can they clean up glitter?
It's on my hooves!
Are we done yet?
This is sooooo boring!
Finally, something we can agree on!
Treasure hunting!
Cool!
Now, what would be even cooler is if we could find a treasure chamber or something!
Now, if I were a secret door, where would I be?
Look!
A lever!
It's stuck!
Come help me, Rarity!
Yeah, well, you ruined my treasure hunt!
Who cares about clothes?
We're supposed to be on an adventure together!
Fine by me!
Maybe I can spend some time doing something I actually like now!
I don't think we can.
You don't care about any of the things I like!
It's always about you and your boring fashions!
We need to be able to fly!
Duh!
The Wonderbolts show was ruined!
Rarity's hat was blocking everypony's view!
No way am I wearing those!
The library?
And this helps us how?
Ugh!
Fine!
Uh, what's so funny?
But they're real!
You even met Daring Do!
Ca-ba-ller-on!
Just like it looks!
How hard is that?
Seriously?
Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade!
What a yawn fest!
W-Wait.
He was?
Not my fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!
At least we agree on that!
From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who get me!
What's gone?
Don't worry, Twilight!
I know tons about searching for lost treasure!
Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!
Don't you see?
The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!
Azurantium?
You know!
The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from Daring Do book four is made from?
It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes.
Just like this, remember?
It's from the book you just read!
Seriously?
After giving me all that grief, you didn't read mine either?
As soon as we find this amulet, we are done with each other!
Who cares?
I found a bigger clue!
Nah.
It's too deep.
We'll get stuck.
Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.
Nope.
If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks.
I could, try and slingshot my way through.
But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet.
Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft.
Uh, that, is, awesome!
Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess.
How did you know how to do that?
How are we supposed to find the Amulet of Aurora now?
I think it's a Bufogren.
They have really sensitive ears.
Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?
Hold that thought!
His breath smells so bad, I can't think!
But we can't hear him from back here.
Now what?
Now that I can do!
Uh, we're doing this together, remember?
Sorry, but I wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp.
Huh.
Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.
High heels could do that?
I shouldn't have said that.
Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do.
Some of it's actually sorta neat.
Soooo, does this mean we're still friends?
Yeah!
Wait!
That tunnel leads to the, school?
A secret passage!
Awesome!
Yeah.
We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together.
I mean, imagine if we did!
How boring would that be?
We still have a little time left.
You wanna, go hit the shops?
I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.
Uh, yeah!
Let's go already!
Is it supposed to sound like that?
Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?
Please.
Don't.
Yeah, we just need to be supportive of her practicing...
So the getting-better part happens as fast as possible.
Like, now!
Does this answer your question?
For second place.
Second!
Place!
All because of Pinkie's playing!
Yeah!
If anything, she's gotten worse!
Ugh, fine!
So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?
Well, it's, uh, It's just, You need to know, uh...
Twilight?
We were all really nervous to tell you.
There you are!
We've been looking all over for you!
I don't get it.
So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone.
What's the big deal?
There are so many other things she's really good at doing.
Don't blame yourself.
None of us did any better.
We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony.
Yeah!
If anything could help Pinkie Pie cheer up and make her forget about her yovidaphone, this is definitely it!
And all of Pinkie's stuff is, gone?
Fine!
How about if I ask you a?
Wait.
Yeah!
Why would she want to go live with the yaks?
Then what are we waiting around here for?
Let's get going to Yakyakistan!
Are you sure?
Because that actually sounds kinda, good.
Huh.
Not what I expected.
Oh, sorry.
I said I was sorry!
Oh, uh, sorry!
We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.
Wow.
That was a lot easier than I thought.
We're awesome!
Yeah, we've tried everything!
Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play.
If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!
Ladies and gentleyaks!
Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of stomps for, Pinkie Pie!
Me, neither.
Huh?
Oh, hey, Scootaloo.
I was just in the neighbor?
What's this?
Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?
I could ask you the same question!
It's no use pretending!
I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for every meeting!
Well, sure it sounds weird when you say it out loud.
And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still.
Why are you starting a new fan club?
What is a The Washouts?
Stunt troupe?
Twenty bajillion?
Boring old flight and formation junk?
Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.
Can you believe she actually said that?
I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool!
And, And it kinda sounded like she didn't think I was cool either.
But, peh, we all know that's crazy!
I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else.
Heh.
Nope.
Not!
All!
But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?
They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?
Look at this!
It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!
Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on.
Hello?
The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too!
We practically invented sitting on bleachers!
And look at that!
Popcorn and cotton candy?
Ripoff!
Lame.
Whoa.
Come on, come on!
She's not gonna make it!
That, was, insane!
Woo-hoo!
I mean, It was pretty cool.
Who are these guys?
You can if you're with me.
After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless.
Observe.
Hey!
Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show.
Heh.
Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a, pause for dramatic effect, a Wonderbolt.
O, kay, No way!
Cool!
What's your story?
Uhhh, Okay.
So, who's the leader?
Lightning Dust!
Lightning Dust!
I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts!
Or should I say, lack of brains!
Yeah, well, I'm still?
If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second.
Well, I'm glad it all worked out.
Your show was pretty dynamite.
Well, we do have safety rules for a reason.
It's not about making anypony feel bad.
It's about finding the best flyers.
The best of the best.
I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt.
Uh, lemme think.
And also, no!
That's it!
You're comin' with me!
To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!
Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?
You, What?
See?
This is what I was telling you about.
Patent pending?
I think she gets the point?
Uh, Heh.
Sorry that was a little, intense.
I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt.
That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps.
Heh.
Everypony's dream, right?
Same difference.
Clearing things up is one of my specialties.
Now, come on.
Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff.
I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club.
You know, the one about me?
How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly?
Nah!
I'm just kidding.
That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it?
Oh, oh!
Maybe if they're framed, it's like, Wow, she's so humble!
Ya think?
Scootaloo?
Uh, Scootaloo?
Anypony seen Scootalo?
My fault, my fault!
Sorry, I?
Twilight?
Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.
Seriously?
You haven't seen Scoot, have you?
I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice!
Why can't she see how dangerous they are?
But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!
But what if she chooses them over me?
She's gonna get hurt!
Um, maybe you're right.
But this isn't about me.
I'm just worried about Scoot.
You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?
I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.
Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!
Obviously, you do!
Because you can't see how dangerous this is!
Do you not remember what Spitfire said?
That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.
That's it!
We're leaving!
You're right.
You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions.
I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time.
Great!
So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.
Wouldn't have it any other way!
I'm the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club.
I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest.
But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me.
I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club.
Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.
Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville!
With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the, Scootaloo Fan Club!
W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong.
Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?
I'll tell you the real problem here.
We haven't given Rockhoof the chance to be who he really is.
Ugh.
A hero!
What we need to do is find him a job that's as epic as he is!
You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?
And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
Ta-da!
The Pegasus Weather Factory!
Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.
I know, right?
Hey!
The cool stuff's over here!
Come on!
We gotta catch 'em!
The students dropped out of the sky!
We barely caught everypony in time!
Still think there's nothing to worry about?
Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?
Uh, duh!
Magic this, magic that.
We don't need magic to go on a little hike.
I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!
Maybe he was wrong.
Don't look at it!
It'll turn you to stone!
Look out!
So you are behind this!
How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?
Then I guess we'll just have to bust our way out!
That didn't work.
Good boy!
Race ya!
It's about time you noticed!
Nope!
Makes perfect sense.
We're awesome!
Does this mean we get all your powers?
Ooh, ooh!
I call dibs on showing up in everypony's dreams!
Stage one, you get big news and you're like Nooooo, but then you pace, and you chart, you worry...
Um, if you think about it, they literally almost never help.
See?
We've almost always done things without the princesses' help!
Which makes sense now, because it was all just training for you to take over!
She's got a point.
We totally just wiped the castle with that guy!
What.
Just.
Happened?
Then we'll just have to beat him the old-fashioned way!
This is usually when you say something funny to lift our spirits.
Let me help!
I'm faster!
Twilight, this is bad!
Like, really bad!
Ahem.
Aw, yeah!
Go get 'em, beardy!
Not if I can help it!
Okay, guess we need a different plan.
Twilight?
Ooh, will I go here?
Or here?
Or here, or there?
Gotcha!
A little less talking and a little more helping?
Okay, King Sombra!
Time to give up the crown!
Discord!
And we keep telling bad guys.
That's Discord for ya.
Well, we are kind of an awesome team.
Congratulations, Silverstream!
You're officially the first non-Pegasus Wonderbolt!
Easy!
You're kicking off our show right now!
So get up there and make me proud!
Of course we'll help.
But how?
Uh, how is you making a break-in plan the opposite of Twilight doing it?
We got questions, and you're gonna serve us up some answers, juice jockey!
So make like a glass of O.
and spill!
Wait.
Did you just make all that up, or did that actually happen?
The Wonderbolts did a fly-by, and the only way past those giant fans and into the castle ducts is here.
But there's no room for mistakes!
Um, the location to a secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle.
Zephyr Breeze?
How is this perfect?
He's the most annoying pony in Equestria, and he's totally obsessed with me, and we have to come up with a way to distract?
Oh, no.
Oh, no-no, no way!
Unh-unh!
Not really.
I mean, eh, totally.
Why don't you step into the light so I can see how, ugh, handsome you look in it?
Yep.
You're real guard material.
Blech.
And the other half might open a secret passage to the castle!
Uh, what are you guys doing down here?
I can't believe this worked!
So, if Twilight and Shining Armor failed, who gets the crown?
I think they have a pretty good idea.
Well, he better get his flank over here then!
You have to win the first few games without me cheering you on.
Applejack was too busy to come, so she made me promise to go to all the museum exhibits and tell her about them.
I'm gonna try to get in first and beat the crowd so I can get back to the tournament faster.
What?
The doors aren't even open yet!
What kind of sports fan camps out for a museum?
Quibble Pants?
Fancy meeting me?
I'm a sportspony.
Of course I'd be here.
What's fancy is you being here.
If fancy meant confusing.
Uh, it's a buckball field.
And you are?
Um, you've met Daring Do, so that's probably an exaggeration.
No offense.
And who is this?
I kind of wanted to skip the museum, too.
But I promised a friend that I'd check out all the exhibits.
So, you and Clear Sky, huh?
What do you mean?
A ball?
It's a basket.
How do you not know what these are?
Well, I figured you weren't the sportiest pony in Equestria.
Uh, why?
Here.
Give it a shot.
It's easy.
Yeah, I don't think she's fooled.
No problem.
I've totally got your flank.
Trust me, the game's a lot harder to play with apples.
Who do you think taught them?
Of course, being a Wonderbolt takes up most of my time, so I don't get to practice as much as I'd like.
Hmm, you don't say.
You know, Quibble's pretty sporty, too.
I think I've seen enough of this museum for three Applejacks.
Let's go watch some buckball!
Uh, do you mean ball park?
Of course she will.
She just needs to see your sporty side.
Everypony has a sporty side, and we're gonna find yours.
By the end of the day, I am gonna turn you into the sportiest pony in Equestria!
It's either that or be yourself and bond with Wind over comic books and role-playing games.
What?
Wow.
We need to get started on Operation: Sportify ASAP.
To figure out what your sporty side is, we just need to see what your skills are.
Everypony's got something.
Speed!
Strength!
Agility!
Heh.
Of course, some ponies can do it all.
Right.
We should probably start small.
I'll pass the ball to you, and you just pass it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Maybe agility's not your thing.
Ready?
Yep.
Remember, think speed.
Come on, Quibble.
You got this!
If we had time to train, I know I could mold you into the perfect sportspony.
Or at least a sportier pony.
Maybe you're not the best athlete in Equestria, or the most coordinated, or the fastest, or, even a little bit strong.
But none of that matters because I just figured out how to sportify you!
Well, you can thank Quibble.
He's friends with the sportiest ponies around, so he must be pretty sporty, too, right?
I guess you'll find out.
I think it's time we told Wind about your next surprise.
books are awesome.
And BTW, this is way more awesomer than that!
For the tournament halftime show, you and Quibble are gonna play a game of buckball against Team Ponyville!
Uh, you should probably stretch.
Look, you wanted to impress Wind Sprint, and this just made sense.
Don't worry, I've got your flank.
I already talked to Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy.
They're totally gonna make you look good.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure everypony knows you're not supposed to score in the other team's goal.
What are you doing out here?
Come on.
That goal you scored for the other team was amazing.
What?
We haven't even gotten started!
I've got, like, seven more top-notch ideas to turn you into a super-sporty pony!
It's throw in the towel.
And that's ridiculous!
You can't just give up!
It's beating her to the punch, and it's barely a sports reference.
How do you not know that?
So you should stop pretending!
Look, you are terrible at sports.
You're uncoordinated, slow, weak?
And you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics.
But maybe I'm not the pony you should've come to for help.
Say wha?
Wha, Hah!
Nah!
Technically, he still needed to buy her the book, but that's it.
Don't be so surprised.
I'm awesome at everything!
Except for baking.
Don't worry, Yona.
That was the hard one.
Mine's way easier.
A little dance called the Pony Prance!
The key to this one is speed!
Come on, Yona, try it!
Just get with the flow and let yourself go!
Whoa there!
Look!
She's dancing!
You dance great!
It's the opposite.
If anything, we should be apologizing.
We all decided you and Yona totally earned this.
Guess who just got three front-row tickets to the Wonderbolts show next week!
Uh, that is not the reaction I was expecting.
What?
No way!
Scootaloo belongs here!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I cannot believe you're giving up so easily.
You're the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
Solving tough problems is what you do.
It's Cutie Mark Crusader Appreciation Day!
But we couldn't start without all of them here.
Oh, it's way more than just a club.
The CMCs have made a difference for everypony here.
No way!
After all that, you're still gonna make her leave?
I don't think that thing knows what small is.
All the times we've actually needed their help, and they show up for this?
I can't read this thing.
How am I supposed to lead a Filly Guides hike if the map makes us more lost?
How are we supposed to learn to be rulers of Equestria with them fixing every teensy problem for us?
Well, there are waaaay more fun things to do than follow us around.
One question.
Why?
And we're nowhere near ready!
You!
You're on food duty!
I thought Pinkie Pie said to get here right away.
Sorry I'm late!
But when Twilight said she needed my help with the buckball team, I figured I'd better grab every piece of coaching equipment I could find!
So what should I focus on?
Offense?
Defense?
Trick plays?
Awesome!
Lay it on me.
Whatever it is, I'll give it a hundred and twenty percent!
Cheerleading?
I don't mean to sound ungrateful.
It's just when you said you wanted my help with something important, I thought you meant something important.
Well, sure, cheer squad is totally important to somepony who isn't me.
But I'm more about ponies playing in the game, not cheering for it.
I mean, it's great that some ponies only want to cheer, though I don't know why they would.
Of course I've seen cheer squads before, on the sidelines, but I'm not even a hundred percent sure what they do.
I'll probably just mess it up.
What do you mean?
Okay, So why are you here?
You don't even go to this school.
Ugh.
Dancing.
Right.
I've seen you two around school, haven't I?
I didn't know you three would be here.
I didn't realize you were into school spirit, Smolder.
Don't count on it.
Eh, I'unno.
I mean, if you guys were an actual buckball team, I'd have plenty of ideas.
But I don't know anything about cheerleading.
If you say so.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Listen, you guys don't have anything to worry about.
Nope.
In fact, I think what you all just did is totally fine.
You guys have got this.
So, uh, I'm just gonna head down to the field.
Uh, great practice, everypony!
Ugh!
What are you doing?
I watched them cheer stuff.
Looked fine to me.
Uh, nothing?
Ooh!
I think you're blowing this a little out of proportion.
You know what?
You're right!
Why don't you do it?
I mean, you're the one with a vested interest.
Snails' practice is definitely weird.
Uh, I thought Snips was practicing with you.
So don't dance and cheer.
I dunno.
Okay.
I've got something for you to do.
You guys asked me to come up with something, and I did.
Then I'm out of ideas.
Ugh, fine.
Okay.
Since you guys have been nagging me nonstop about this cheer stuff for, like, ever, I went around and got everything you need!
Beats me, but Applejack seemed pretty sure about it.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Yeah.
Zecora's a lot less helpful than you'd think.
That's from the library so you can come up with cheers.
Okay!
Good practice!
Ugh!
Look.
I talked to my friends, and they said this is the stuff you need.
Wouldn't a true cheer squad be able to figure out what to do with it?
Well, then it's a good thing I got you all this stuff.
You better get to work!
Yeah!
Wow!
This team is really shaping up!
Nice job!
You're serious.
How much work does cheer squad need?
Oh, yeah!
Nice one!
Huh?
What?
I don't know what everypony's so upset about.
So it wasn't great.
Cheerleading's never great.
That's why everypony gets up to get a snack during it.
What is the big deal?
I didn't try?
What are you talking about?
I got you a party cannon!
It's not my fault you couldn't figure out how to use it right.
Whoa.
Ponies might actually care about cheer squad if she cheered like that all the time.
Because they don't.
Why?
Maybe I can.
Wait!
Look, I know I haven't been a great coach because I don't care about cheerleading.
But all of you do, and I care about you.
So I guess maybe I care about cheer squad.
And a good friend reminded me that I can make anything I care about totally awesome.
So from now on, I'm gonna give this thing a hundred and twenty percent, and I expect the same from you.
We are gonna dance!
We are gonna cheer!
We're gonna make the biggest pony pyramid Equestria's ever seen!
And when we're done, we're gonna make sure everypony on that field is so pumped up, they'll forget they even came to see a game!
I know how you feel!
What?
Oh, yeah, totally.
But I wasn't talking about the game.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Aaah!
Sorry!
Can't talk right now!
Not bad, right?
Well, they have a pretty decent coach.
You guys were amazing!
It was flawless.
I can't think of any way that could've been better!
The game was just a sideshow.
You guys were the main event!
Wait a second.
Was this one of those things where you knew the lesson I needed to learn before I learnt it?
Ugh!
Then you better hope you get paired with me, because I am gonna rule this game!
I hope you realize not every category is gonna be Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them.
Rigged!
But, that-that's totally different!
Don't choke.
Nyah!
Twenty!
Please-don't-give-us-more-work...
Please-don't-give-us-more-work...
Please-don't-give-us-more-work...
I knew it!
This is it?
We were kinda with Discord on this one.
Could you not go popping us all over the place, please?
Fluttershy and I are meeting the Pegasi from Cloudsdale to give them changes to the weather.
Just what's on that little card.
No big deal.
Oh, yeah, totally.
You're not gonna panic and screw it up at all!
It's total chaos out there!
But, uh, we don't know what to do now that everything's all ready!
Well, that's a relief!
She'll totally freak out!
We have a miracle!
Don't we?
OH, COME ON!
Or not!
We didn't want you to freak out.
Next time you say you're not gonna freak out, we'll believe you.
Too bad Spike's not here.
I bet he could help you narrow it down.
Wait 'til you get to Daring Do and the Riddle of the Sphinx!
Fallen Idol?
That's not in the series.
No way Daring Do's biggest fan, me, would miss a book coming out!
Besides, AK Yearling always sends me a copy.
The true story of the thieving fraud known as Daring Do?
What?
Why would AK Yearling write that about herself?
Who?
A bad one.
The only thing worse than Daring Do's destruction of temples is her cruelty to the mild-mannered Dr Caballeron?
More like a disaster!
Listen!
Daring Do isn't just a fictional character from over-the-top adventure stories.
I've met her, and she is a real, live pony!
That's supposed to be a secret!
We're the only ones who know Daring Do is really AK Yearling in disguise.
But if other ponies read this book, how long will it take them to figure that out?
We have to go warn her!
Fluttershy!
Yearling is signing all her books at the bookstore today.
We can warn her about what's going on.
Uh, why?
The only true thing in that pack of lies is that Daring Do is real.
Are you serious right now?
A random writer trashes our friend and exposes her secret, and you want to talk about birds?
What?
In order to save precious artifacts from the bad guy, who you seem to have forgotten is Dr Caballeron!
Are you sure you read the same series I did?
Well, at least AK Yearling's true fans know Martingale's book is bogus.
I, guess we're a little late to warn you about the new book, huh?
No way!
He's doing a signing across the street?
That's not Martingale!
It's Dr Caballeron in disguise!
Now it all makes sense!
Daring Do's archnemesis created a fake author self so he can write books that make him sound like a hero!
Who does that?
This is totally different.
Well, well, well!
Up to your old tricks again, huh?
Just like in Somnambula!
Spreading lies to make Daring Do look bad!
We know who you really are!
And unless you want us to tell all of them, you'd better answer some questions!
We aren't gonna let you get away with this, Caballeron!
You mean lying!
That sounds like more of an editor's mistake.
But I don't have to take your word for it!
C'mon, Fluttershy!
Finally!
What took you so long?
Say whaaaaaaat?
You have to help me!
Groom Q Martingale is really Dr Caballeron, and he has Fluttershy!
The book thing was his new plan to ruin Daring Do's reputation, and he's trying to make my friend a criminal!
They're off to Tenochtitlan right now!
That's gotta be why Caballeron tricked Fluttershy into joining his gang!
Fluttershy must be having the worst time with Caballeron's goons!
Why?
What's so special about it?
So if this Talisman is so important, why didn't you already save it?
You said only a Pegasus can get it, right?
We didn't see any cats!
We're just here to rescue Fluttershy!
Phew!
That was cutting it close.
We're not taking no for an answer!
Admit it, Caballeron!
You're only pretending to like Fluttershy because she has the wings you needed to steal the Truth Talisman!
Isn't that right?
Didn't see that coming.
Or that!
How do you get rid of them?
Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
I'm gonna need the deluxe spa package after this adventure.
That doesn't leave this temple!
Uh, did you forget there's a monster out there that wants to crush us?
Or maybe he's just the bad guy!
Do I need to remind you he's tried to squash Daring Do like a hundred times?
Maybe there is something to this whole listening-to-everypony thing.
Hey, what's going on?
I thought your first co-written novel would bring out a ton of fans.
Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.
Well, duh.
Young ponies like you could get lost and never find your way back.
But I still can't go.
Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off.
It's also a responsibility.
You'll understand when you get older.
I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you.
Weather for the coronation is sunny skies!
It was weird, though.
Not many Pegasi wanted to help me clear the clouds.
They were kinda on edge.
How could they be?
How many times have you saved their flanks by now?
You look like you were in a sugar war.
IN WHAT WORLD IS THAT GOOD NEWS?
You'll come up with something to save the day!
Any idea how we get out of here to do that?
That's gonna need to be a pretty epic make-up.
That, was a pretty epic make-up.
What about the Earth ponies and Pegasi?
Cowardly?
Listen up, buddy?
We know things look bad, but we've been in tough spots before, and we always?
And it's not like things can get any worse.
We have to do something!
If we're facing impossible odds, we're facing them together!
Sweet!
I'll grab that bell in ten second?
No matter what, we face it together!
Or the beginning of an even more awesome era!
In three, two, one, and, Of course!
And I know we can pull it off!
Sorry, Twilight.
I don't have time to talk.
We've got a lot more work to do before the coronation.
And I'm gonna meet the Wonderbolts so we can go over the routine one last time.
I wouldn't say scared.
Buuuut just because I won't say it doesn't mean I don't feel it.
W, What if we don't see each other?
And I need to meet the Wonderbolts!
Where's the coronation team?
Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's going, we're going with her.
Right, girls?
What?
Why not?
So you're lookin' to dethrone Sunset Shimmer and become Princess of the Fall Formal, huh?
Gotta say, I'd really love to see that happen.
I'll totally help you out!
All you gotta do is beat me in a game of one-on-one.
First to five goals wins.
One-zip!
That's game!
So what's the plan?
How can I help you be princess instead of Sunset Shimmer?
Of course you lost.
I'm awesome!
But I'm not gonna help just anybody try and beat Sunset Shimmer.
The Fall Formal Princess should be someone with heart and determination.
You've proved that you've got 'em both!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that isn't the reason.
That, is, awesome!
Rock on!
I can!
We're awesome!
Maybe she was too embarrassed to show!
She's gotta know you won by a landslide!
You, are, so awesome!
Spike!
Spike!
Fluttershy!
She has us!
Ah, you're back!
What are hands?
Would ya say she's just as awesome as me?
No, Pinkie.
That's the problem!
I need something that looks as awesome as I'm gonna make it sound.
Hands off my guitar, Trixie!
All right!
Let's see who plays best!
Shred on.
Check me out!
Uh, she can have it.
Turns out this is the one that really speaks to me.
I doubt it.
Come on, Pinkie.
You're s'posed to help me find a drummer for my band.
Most people don't know how hard it is to find someone who could use both hands the way a drummer does.
Now, it's important that our banner look awesome!
So feel free to use as much glitter as you want.
A drummer can't just be anybody.
They need to have the right instincts, you know?
It's gotta be someone with a lot of, energy.
I mean, a lot!
Energy, enthusiasm, They have to be able to carry the whole band on their shoulders!
Ugh!
Pinkie!
Cool!
I dunno.
Guess I just have a sense for these things.
Ugh!
Where is Rarity?
Rarity, couldn't you have chosen a more portable instrument?
Well, our time's up.
I guess we'll have to move our practice to the gym.
You mean a keytar.
Cool!
Of course that's her real name!
Who cares why it happens?
It makes my band totally awesome!
Duh!
It was my idea to start the Rainbooms so we could be in the showcase.
Plus I'm the lead singer and guitarist.
Uh, we're getting there.
Rarity's still coming in a little late on the second verse, and Applejack's bass solo could use a little work.
They'll get it together in time for the showcase.
We've still got a few minutes before lunch starts.
What do you say we do Awesome As I Wanna Be?
We'll get to it.
Maybe we should just let her tell us.
That's not what's happening!
We saw all of this go down in the cafeteria too!
Yes.
They've gotten to everybody.
So let's take them down!
It's not like we haven't tangled with dark magic before and totally whooped its sorry butt!
Uh, no offense.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
The portal's closed.
And I get the feeling they don't exactly have cell phones where she's from.
So what are you waiting for?
Get to writing!
I hate to burst your bubble, Twilight, but the connection between their world and Equestria will still be totally cut off for a super long time.
I'm starting to think she's not coming.
Yeah, so, that isn't exactly the only strange thing that's happened since you left.
Pretty sweet, huh?
It happens to all of us when we play.
They'll never even know what hit 'em!
Uh, weren't there rainbows and lasers and stuff last time?
Like, as in, lead singer?
Cuz that's usually my gig.
This being my band and all.
Okay, yeah, that's cool.
I'll just use this as a chance to hone my already insanely good lead guitar skills.
Let's get to learning that musical counter-spell!
I doubt it.
So, Twilight, how is that counter-spell comin'?
I think it's pretty obvious what's going wrong with this counter-spell.
I have to pick up the slack somehow!
Are you guys even trying?
We compete in the Battle of the Bands for real!
I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals!
We unleash the counter-spell then!
You'll have figured it out by finals, right?
Then let's go win us a Battle of the Bands!
Let's get ready to rock!
Got it!
Be cool enough to win, but not so cool that we end up showing off the whole ears and tails and rainbows thing.
Sooo, about twenty percent less cool.
And what was with the confetti, Pinkie Pie?
How am I supposed to shred if there's paper stuck in my frets?
It's the semifinals.
We gotta do Awesome As I Wanna Be.
My superior guitar playing and off-the-charts awesome singing voice?
Puh-leeze!
I could win this thing as a solo act and everybody knows it!
What was that?
Yeah, well, you didn't.
You guys wanna keep it down?
They're about to announce who's moving on.
Yeah, well, not as much as we are!
Check, one, two.
What are you doing here, Trixie?
Pretty sure the losers are supposed to be up there in the cheap seats.
Hey!
If you wanna tell Twilight she's getting a little too caught up trying to be the new leader of this band, you don't have to be all cryptic about it.
I'm just trying to make sure my band rocks as hard as it needs to!
I'm the one who writes all the songs!
I wish I never asked any of you to be in my band!
We're getting our band back together!
I know just the song.
Fluttershy's written a really great one.
How are we supposed to play over them from up here?
Sweet!
You know, Twilight is going back to Equestria soon.
The Rainbooms could really use someone to help Fluttershy on backup vocals.
We'll see.
You ready or what?
Uh, I thought we were rehearsing.
Crystal Prep High School.
The competition!
Gah!
What are you doing?
That's, like, the opposite of camouflage!
Quick!
Get down!
We need to get a better view!
We're trying to eavesdrop!
That means they don't hear us!
What are you doing?
We're trying to spy on them!
Do you even know what the word spy means?
It means being sneaky!
It means not being seen!
It means BEING QUIET!
Um, not exactly.
It totally does!
Well, I was going to pony up and show our fans some awesome guitar licks, but I kinda need all six strings to do it.
Got any extra?
No problem.
The acoustics in the hallway are perfect for power chords.
C'mon!
Let's go!
Well, you don't have to.
Because I've totally figured out who it was!
Seeing as how they got off a bus from the city and got back on a bus headed to the city, I'll bet they go to...
Yep.
With the Friendship Games starting tomorrow, they'd totally try to prank us by defacing the Wondercolts statue.
Because even though they beat us in everything, soccer, tennis, golf, they still have to gloat!
So I guess you think the Friendship Games are silly, too.
Not anymore!
This time, things are gonna be different.
Oh, you'll find out.
Thank you, Principal Celestia.
I know a lot of you might think there's no way we can beat a fancy school like Crystal Prep at anything.
And I know that CHS has never won the Friendship Games even once.
Crystal Prep students are super athletic, super smart, and super motivated.
But there's one thing they aren't.
They aren't Wondercolts!
I know, right?
It's probably because I'm so awesome!
Okay.
Anybody have any guesses what the events are gonna be?
I hope the Friendship Games have a music competition, because we would totally rock it!
You really didn't have to do that.
Did you just say Crystal Prep?
You're saying that Twilight's gonna play against us?
She'd never do that!
Come on, guys!
Let's see if we can find any info about the events and come up with a strategy.
You comin', Sunset?
How'd that happen?
Um, we do.
That was awesome!
For now, let's just focus on beating the Shadowbolts.
And as long as this event puts me in a playing field, I don't think we've got anything to worry about.
Awesome!
I wasn't about to let my friend become plant food.
We can still win this!
Better than all right!
We won!
That's okay.
Neither do we.
But we have to play.
This is the last event!
Hang on!
Twilight!
The bus for Camp Everfree leaves in ten minutes!
Yeah, probably not gonna do that.
Uh, you know they provide us with food and tents, right?
Ooh!
Rock climbing!
Archery!
Tetherball!
Me, too!
Oh, yeah!
You guys comin' or what?
I think that only happens to you.
I hear what you're saying, Timber, but we're Canterlot Wondercolts.
We've got a reputation to uphold!
And there was no way we were gonna leave this place without contributing the most awesome camp gift ever!
I'm with AJ.
Building a new dock is definitely it!
What do you guys think?
Oh, we'll add lanterns so you can see at night!
Uh, duh.
The toolbox?
Ugh.
Yeah, I'm terrified she'll try to tell it again.
I don't know.
Gaea Everfree could be some creature that got booted from Equestria and ended up in this world.
That's what happened with the sirens.
What happened?
Oh, man!
All our hard work!
Ruined!
Yeah, so you can totally go faster than you're going.
Sorry.
I've been waiting to do this since we got here.
Oh, good!
Twilight, if you spot me, I can finally go.
I'll go get another harness.
I don't know.
I started running to get the harness, and the next thing I knew, I was practically back in town!
Because I lost it when I got far away.
And then it came back when I got close to camp.
For once.
And I've barely gotten to whoop anybody in tetherball.
Phew!
Uh, you gonna give us a hand here, Rarity?
Oh, I can't go any faster!
I don't want to end up in the woods again.
Really?
It's okay.
Do you have them now, too?
Okay, that was pretty awesome!
Oh, come on!
We literally just finished building that!
What we always do!
Save the day!
Enough about our wardrobe!
We've got to stop Gloriosa from trapping everybody in here!
You're okay!
Our band could play!
Hey, don't sweat it, it's kinda what we do.
You know what else is cool?
Our awesome new superpowers!
I handed out, like, four hundred fliers, set up the stage, and still had time to pick up pizza!
I love my super-speed!
Third time is a charm.
Or is it fifth?
I've lost track.
Hah!
Thanks, Big Mac.
Sweet!
More cash to add to the stash!
Hey, anybody seen Twilight lately?
But we're running out of time!
The camp fundraising deadline is next week.
And Pinkie Pie's already hosted a bake sale, Twilight and Fluttershy had that doggie day care, and Sunset Shimmer and I planned this car wash.
Uh-huh!
Hah!
Then of course you can use the money for costumes!
Sweet!
Hey!
What happened to the music?
Are you crazy?
We're great at doing stuff super-fast.
I mean, look at Pinkie Pie.
She just built that castle made entirely out of chocolate bars while we were talking.
So let's create one!
Oh, oh!
I do!
So, we're in the middle of the jungle.
And we're being chased by henchmen who are shooting poison arrows at us!
When suddenly, out of nowhere, the shadow of a giant beast appears!
Oh, yeah.
That's why it seemed so cool.
Never mind.
Thanks, Pinkie!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Sorry.
But at this point in the story, Stalwart Stallion would be known as Mojo.
What?
You think he wants Daring Do fans to call him out for making a mistake like that?
I can't believe we're really here!
Eh-heh!
Little?
This is Daring Do we're talking about!
This movie is gonna be huge!
I don't know what a cupcake fountain is, but I'm pretty sure they don't have one.
Check out the props that AK Yearling designed specially for the movie?
Wow!
These are the three Altoriosa Relics!
The Sword!
They're awesome!
You guys should've seen the relics.
They were amazing!
Sorry!
Maybe I'll just go take one more peek at them.
They're gone!
They're all gone!
I wanted to check them out again up close, and they weren't there!
I-It'll be okay, though, right?
But-but you have to finish this movie!
Think of all the Daring Do fans who'll be so disappointed if you don't!
I don't know who's behind this or what's going on, but the first thing we need to do is find those relics.
Hey!
Stop right there!
I can't believe I lost them!
My geode gives me super speed, but I guess being awesomely fast doesn't help when the person you're chasing knows their way around better than you do.
We spotted this super-suspicious cloaked figure, but they got away.
They're here somewhere.
And where did she go?
Ugh!
We're running out of time!
We're supposed to be hunting down the missing relics and catching the bad guy, not eating pudding!
Don't worry!
I've got this!
I saw you come in here.
Where are you?
Hey!
This is just like the outfit Daring Do wears in the nightclub scene.
What's it doing in here?
Hey!
Hello?
Anybody out there?
No problem!
I'll just call my friends and let them know?
Except I can't because security took all our phones when we got here.
Help!
I'm trapped in here!
Help!
Somebody!
I'm trapped in here!
Yes!
Help!
I'm locked in!
Boy, am I happy to see you!
How did you find me?
I gave up banging on the door five minutes ago.
Yeah.
But I didn't see the person who locked me in, and there's still no sign of the relics.
How?
I just told you I didn't see who locked me in here.
They're gone!
When did you figure out it was her?
Heh, heh.
Don't suppose you've got any extra parts my friends and I could play?
You know, heh, as a reward for saving the day?
This is so awesome!
Uh, sorry.
Chillax, SunShim.
That's Sunset Shimmer's new movie star name.
I just made it up!
Y'know, if you hadn't tried to sabotage the movie, you could be celebrating with us.
You call that a freakout?
Not our number-one problem right now, Rarity.
Chocolate-covered almonds?
Whoa!
Check out our geodes!
Come on!
Go for it!
Oh, yeah!
Challenge accepted!
C'mon, kid!
Let's show 'em what we've got!
Top that, Apples!
I guess that was pretty awesome.
But, uh, any chance you guys wanna rematch?
Heh-heh!
One, two!
This is gonna be great!
A whole afternoon with just me and the best books ever written!
Daring Do and the Forbidden City of Clouds by AK Yearling.
Slingshot will never catch me now!
The Doomed Diadem is going back where it belongs!
Huh?
So long, Slingshot!
Now I just have to find A.
Ravenhoof's old pal, Brumby.
Then, he'll lead me to the Forbidden City of Clouds.
Huh, Caballeron?
I-Is that you?
Reveal yourself!
Heh.
I'm ready.
Where is Applejack?
How are we supposed to go on tour if we don't have the tour bus she promised us?
Awkward!
And she passes it up the wind!
She's coming in for the winning goal!
She shoots!
She?
Oops.
Heh-heh.
That looks unsafe.
I finished up early.
Where is everybody else?
Turns out they do wanna do this!
The powerups?
You're lucky you're only in one club.
I'm in five this year.
So busy.
I meant five sports clubs!
You have got to be kidding me!
After all that?
How did we miss that one?
Hi, guys!
I just ran here from the soccer field in three seconds!
Wait, hold on!
Forgot my backpack!
Yuck!
This needs mustard.
Super speed is where it's at, am I right?
It's like, I can't stop because I've been getting so much done!
Whoopsies.
Uh, I forgot I have to be at a, uh, a thing.
A whole day in the big city to do whatever we want!
Pinkie, I love your riddles, but?
Tank here is a tortoise.
Maybe he could help us?
So, what do we do now?
Don't worry.
We'll just carry them to safety.
Well, then, the least we can do is help clear a path for them.
Tank?
Fluttershy, look!
The trail in the sand!
Tank?
Are you okay, Rarity?
Not so f?
Wait!
I got something!
Close, but not quite.
Now that is definitely a?
False alarm.
What even is this?
The sand is full of mysteries!
Oh, hold that thought!
And this.
Got it!
How's that for service?
You made it!
Don't.
No worries, Pinkie.
I got this.
You sure you don't want to try it, Fluttershy?
You can use my board.
Zephyr Breeze?
Since when do you surf?
Come on, Zephyr!
Show us what you and Gladys can do!
Here it comes!
Isn't this great?
The waves today are just killer!
Zephyr?
Zephyr, Ugh.
Fine.
But I'm only doing this for Gladys.
He doesn't deserve you.
Four more hours?
Oh, man!
Might as well be a hundred years!
Take it easy, Twilight!
We'll be back in three months!
Why don't we watch a movie for the last class of the day?
Daring Do vs the Swamp Monsters!
Yes!
Twi?
Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle!
You know that summer break means you can read whatever you want, right?
Anything!
We could even take a trip to the, public, library...
Come on!
Okay.
Here's the game plan for next week.
Hey, everyone!
I'm super-stoked because today is the day!
This skateboard trick is gonna blow your mind!
It's been a super-intense four weeks of training.
Nothing but grinding, claw-stretches, shredding, and shredded lettuce!
Some say it couldn't be done, but get ready, 'cause today, you're going to witness the first ever Tortoise Kicker Ramp Ollie!
Time to bust out of that shell, Tank.
Let's do this!
Wait'll you guys see this!
Awesome!
Don't worry.
I'll add some sick special effects later.
That, doesn't look like the sun to me.
Uh, Rarity, you got anything for winter?
All right!
Huh.
Sunset should be in here.
Ooh, uh, that sounds really cool, but I can't.
I have, uh, plans.
Just chores and stuff!
Gotta go!
You didn't think we'd let you spend your birthday alone, did you?
Check it out!
We're in a band!
Normal Hair!
You guys look great.
Pony!
Uh, Make sure you can move whether you're dancing at the festival or after a hat trick.
Uh, that's not what it's called?
Time to fly!
I'm gonna hide in Pinkie's locker and scare her when she?
Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Arthropods?
Well, duh!
Hey, Rarity.
I don't know what it is, but everyone looks awesome today!
Auditions for the Fall Play!
Uh, you okay, Fluttershy?
You perform all the time with the Rainbooms.
I bet I could help, too, in half the time as Applejack.
You just need a little practice speaking in front of a crowd.
Ready?
You'll thank me later.
Game on!
Lose yourself in the game!
Come on, Fluttershy!
Heh.
And the crowd goes wild.
Uh, am I missing a page?
I think she's broken.
Of course!
Come on, Twilight!
Only ten laps to go!
A great practice always clears my head.
I promise.
You'll feel great in no time.
Right, guys?
Hi-yah!
Hah.
Look at that.
You beat me.
And I only sorta let you win.
Wow.
You got it, AJ!
This is gonna be done before you can say, Take a look at this blueprint!
Already did.
Got it up here.
No time!
What's up?
I'm done, by the way.
Heh.
I guess I was looking at the green prints.
Is that what these are?
Sorry.
Say what now?
Only because I followed your amazing ideas.
I ran to your house while I was building.
Your room is a mess, by the way.
And your diary was unlocked.
I didn't read it.
Okay, I read it.
Your canary tears have summoned me, my child.
It is I, your Fairy Bootmother.
Do not despair, for all coal turns to diamonds.
Y-Yeah.
I certainly enchanted you.
Heh.
That.
Just usin' my magic here!
Classic Bootmother.
Is it gonna be the best night ever or what?
Maybe one of us can turn that heart of coal into a diamond!
Great party, you guys!
Yeah, good times.
I'm just gonna borrow this.
They just needed a little coaching.
Yeah.

They just needed a little coaching.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we know some pretty shy people.
Am I right?
Besides, it's just the yearbook.
Well, I'm entrusting you not to put us next to Best Muscles.
Every time you close the book, it'll be like we're kissing Bulk Biceps!
You mean the white one?
Or the white one?
Yeah.
That's the one I was talking about.
Because you aren't nice.
What are you talking about?
It's been a grueling afternoon, but here we are: the final match!
Next point wins!
A hush falls over the crowd of ten thousand fans.
I'm not holding back this time!
Ooh.
Nice game face, Pinkie Pie.
Oh, come on!
Seriously?
That's gotta be a record.
Forty percent off!
Oh, sorry.
Not helping.
And she's friends with, like, every awesome athlete in the world!
Uh, the Rainbooms?
Let's go see the park!
Well, looks like Rarity doesn't need us as much as you thought.
So, We know every song by heart.
Wouldn't you rather go have some fun?
Pretty great, right?
Can you hear me over all the screaming?
Look at it this way.
It's the perfect opportunity to conquer your fear.
Hey, good idea!
A warm-up before the big game!
Ooh!
What did you have in mind?
Dragon Lands Drag Racing?
Ooh, the Appleloosa Runaway Train!
Ooh, Neighagara Falls Barrel Flume?
Ugh.
I'm proud of you.
You know that?
You're facing your fears head-on.
Just like I always did as a kid.
I mean, look, a four-hundred-foot vertical drop right into these loop-de-loops and a corkscrew?
You're probably super-nervous about that, I bet.
Heh.
And that next part where it goes backwards?
Uh, how are you feeling, Fluttershy?
Is it even safe to be this high up?
You're probably thinking, Stop the ride!
I want to get off!
That's what you want, right?
Right now?
You're about to yell it?
Stop the ride!
Seriously!
Please, somebody stop the ride!
STOP THE RIIIIIIIDE!
Totally!
That's why I didn't want to get off!
I was just saying what you would've said.
That's all.
Heh.
You, too, by the way.
Applejack!
Hey!
I was just about to ride this thing for, like, the tenth time already!
Shhh!
Nothin' outta you!
Oh, she was with me, super scared of this ride, but I think she went off with Vignette.
If you see her, tell her she still owes me a rollercoaster ride!
Heh.
True.
I like it so far, and I assume I'll like what you say next.
Uhhh, there is no way anyone is shaving my head.
But I already am the best?
Aw, man!
Are we trapped in a magical phone?
Typical.
You gonna eat that stress salad?
We're no strangers to getting stuck in magical objects.
Whoa!
The Rainbooms are trending on Snapgab!
You're not too nervous?
I've gotta hand it to ya.
You really have an eye for climactic battle settings!
Imagine going head to head with a sea monster by the pool!
Ka-chow!
Evil Equestrian magic flows up the diving pool!
The boat's sinking!
Everyone's screaming!
And then we save the day!
Better than okay!
She's our friend now!
Best spring break ever!
Which we then uncalaminated, like literal awesome superheroes!
What is it?
Evil magic?
What does that mean?
Hee-yah!
You saw it.
She had a, a, spatula.
So, you're welcome.
Not today!
Sure, he seems cute and cuddly now.
But have you seen what a magic-infused evil rabbit can do?
Yeah, evil carrots!
What's up, AJ?
You can't talk?
Evil magic stole your voice?
Out, evil spirits!
Out!
Or you're seasick.
Heh.
Because of evil magic?
Or not.
Heh.
Has anyone seen bad magic on board?
I'm ready for anything!
Wasn't ready for that.
Nah.
Just looking for bad magic.
What do you mean?
Their magic only shows up in response to your magic!
Huh!
You're a genius!
Hey, gang!
Sorry I'm late!
So, listen.
I've got an idea for our show tonight!
We unleash some awesomeness on the crowd!
I'm talkin' rainbow lasers!
Yeah!
When we?
The other thing!
The rainbow lasers!
It will be after we do it tonight!
Who's with me?
Just say it!
I can take it!
Ouch!
Your words just, punched my feelings.
Rainbow lasers!
It's about to go down!
Not the ship!
The ship's not going down!
Ugh!
I meant evil!
Stop screaming!
She's wasting her time!
Because this is Equestrian magic!
You stop!
We show off our magic, and literally ten seconds later, the power blows?
We scared whatever's out there, and it's fighting back!
We should split up and search the ship!
Who's with me?
Ugh!
That's the last time I ask who's with me?
Whoa!
I knew it!
Evil magic!
You guys gotta see this!
No time for that!
No time for that!
No time for that!
I promise, this is more important than all of your things.
Behold!
Evil magic!
What?
Huh?
The whole ocean was glowing a minute ago!
It went whoosh-whoosh-whoosh w-with little ribbon thingies!
What?
Whaaaat?
If that's what you think, then let's get in lifeboats and I'll prove it!
The magic came from that way!
We sail out and find the source!
Then it's go time!
We take no prisoners!
Who?
You don't want me to be right because you're scared to be a superhero!
Oh, oh!
Excuuuuse me!
We're just ordinary girls who have saved the world from complete destruction multiple times!
Keep telling yourself that!
But the rest of us aren't in denial!
Right, everyone?
Let's get to those boats and do what we do best!
Who's with me?
Okay, that's the last time I say that.
Help!
Help!
Heeeeeellllllp!
Ugh!
Way to go, Rainbow Dash.
You did it again.
You had to go off on your own, didn't you?
Oh, hey!
Uh, heh, 'sup?
Um, just takin' a rest in here, y'know?
Finding evil magic is hard work.
Struggle?
Who's struggling?
I've had a little time to think.
A lot of time, actually.
And I spent most of it wishing I could make it up to you.
Because you were right.
Anyone, could've said that.
Ugh.
Gotta stop saying my name all the time.
I was a little annoyed at first, but I'll admit it: I ruined everyone's spring break for nothing.
There's no magic out here!
Nothing magical at all!
The only villain trying to ruin spring break was me.
What giant plant monster?
Get me out of here!
Try harder!
Oof!
Take your hand?
Of course!
Whoa!
Not about to get eaten.
Good enough for me.
Whoa, Incoming!
Wah!
Y'know, Twilight, since I kinda messed things up on the boat, maybe this could be your vacation!
We're here, we're ponies.
Let's have some fun!
Pony style!
Whoa!
It's just a little rain.
I'm sure our friends are fine.
Uh, ow!
Too hot!
It needs to be, like, twenty percent cooler.
Sound familiar?
This symbol looks familiar.
It's just, That symbol.
It looks exactly like what I thought I saw in the water when we were back on the boat.
But we decided the magic glow was just Mother Nature.
Ladies, it's hero time!
No time to lose!
Let's do this!
With a chance of awesome!
I learned we don't have to go looking for trouble.
Just have to be there for each other when it finds us.
All part of the plan.
It's hero time!
See how easy that was?
No, we agreed on?
Oh, yeah!
All clear!
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Uh, sorry.
I'll be more careful from now on.
Hey!
There they are!
Two peas in the pod!
How was it?
Rad-tacular?
Amaze-magic?
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Oops!
Heh.
Sorry.
I'll be more careful from now on.
You said it, Sunset.
What's with these long lines, man?
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Oops!
Heh.
Sorry.
I'll be more careful from now on.
Hah.
There she is.
The lone wolf.
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Uh, sorry.
I'll be more careful from now on.
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Oops!
Heh.
Sorry.
I'll be more careful from now on.
That was just a little preview of the rad-tacular...
But they lost their voices!
They gotta be using magic!
They wouldn't!
Wait, what am I talking about?
Of course they would.
So what are we gonna do?
Yikes.
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Heh.
Sorry.
Starswirled day one!
Come and get it!
Yes!
Sky's cleared and ready for the festival!
Thank you!
Loved it!
Fabulous takes forever!
But awesome, can get done in four seconds flat!
Faster if I do my sonic rainboom!
Oh come on, it's fine!
Raised in a barn!
Uh, I, don't think those are storm clouds.
Twilight!
We gotta go back there and fight!
Uh, hippos?
Seriously?
Well, you're not getting all the glory.
We're in this together.
Cool!
Who says that?
You are awesome!
Whoa!
I'll show ya!
Blugh!
Whoa whoa whoa!
So you were about to toss us overboard and you stopped for a lunch break?
You weren't always delivery birds, were you?
What about before the Storm King?
Whoa!
You used to be pirates?
So, pirates.
You birds have a choice to make.
You could let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives, or, you could be awesome again!
Awesome!
I knew you had it in ya!
And now for the finishing touch!
Aw, yeah!
Nice!
Ya think she saw my sonic rainboom?
We helped them get their mojo back!
They're not gonna give us up!
What are you doing?
Huh?
Next stop, Mount Aris!
We're almost there!
No, really!
We're actually here!
Hey, Applejack, I'll race ya to that coral!
Say what now?
What?
We gotta get her back!
Yeah.
That was pretty great.
The jig is up!
Yeah!
Come on!
You'd have to be flying faster than a speeding Pegasus to break through that wind!
Uh, make up later!
This isn't over!
Whoa!
I can't believe she did that!
Do we wanna know why you're wrapping up everypony in town?
The less shopping, the better.
How about Twilight's castle tomorrow night, Hearth's Warming Eve?
Okay, what about your favorite food?
Riiiiight, But there's gotta be something you really, really like.
Juuuust getting gift ideas.
Uh, for my pony.
Who isn't you.
So, uh, is there anything you don't like?
Candle.
Great.
Whatever.
Fluttershy-shopping done.
Ghost candle!
What do you want, Discord?
I tried asking her what she likes, but she likes everything.
I've known her a lot longer than you have.
Fine.
I'll get her something else.
Whoa!
Ugh!
Oh, come on!
Fluttershy would love a spa day!
She's Fluttershy!
Everything makes her worry!
Well, if you're such an expert on Fluttershy, what did you get her?
Good!
Please stop helping me!
I'm begging you!
Great.
Still helping.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
You're talking to the fastest pony in Equestria!
If there's some fast animal out there Fluttershy would love, I'm the one who can get it.
I'm calling it!
Dibs!
Guh.
Could you try to make less noise?
Winterchilla?
Be super fast?
Uh, I wouldn't have this little fella without you, so, if you wanna join, Fluttershy would love having you.
And I wouldn't totally hate it.
What is it doing?
Run!
The winterzilla is coming!
What is that?
A winterchilla!
Does everypony know this except me?
Can't you do something?
What?
They're better than my gift.
Sorry about the winterzilla.
You mean you tricked me into putting my friend in danger on purpose so you?
Let's just say it was from both of us.
Out of my way!
No, you don't!
I didn't Triple Dare you back!
First one to finish a Dare, they're Triple Pony Dare champion!
Forever!
Triple Pony Dare ya.
No touching, no wearing, for one, whole, moon!
Aah!
Keep going.
You need twenty more to win this Dare.
Buck one and only one.
Do you know how hard it is to fly slow?
You did?
Me, neither!
Hey!
You stepped on my tail!
That's not what the clue means.
We're supposed to lick the candy canes, then sing carols.
Well?
Which one of these is the thing you need for the perfect Hearth's Warming Eve?
I can't get through a sentence without being cut off!
I'm gonna tell those announcers to pipe down!
Let's go have a friendly teacher chat with those announcers.
On three.
Three!
Wait.
All those voices were yours?
Must be an Alicorn thing.
Take cover!
I'll get you down!
Aw, yeah!
What's your secret?
Say some other pony wanted to be Teacher of the Month.
What should she do?
Teach us!
How can we get our picture on that wall?
Set up and hosted by us!
Beat ya to the balloon!
No, I'm gonna?
Okay, I was fourth.
That's not even?
But I beat you!
Ha-ha!
Wait.
You're bringing work to a festival?
Rarity?
Miss us!
Hope Hollow.
Or, as I like to call it, Rainbow Dash Fan Central!
You know it!
I mean, look at this letter!
They love me there!
At this year's festival, you can eat treats at the traditional Rainbow Bakery Booth, sing your favorite rainbow-themed songs at the karaoke competition...
I 'unno.
Showing up?
General coolness?
All of the above?
Ugh.
Shouldn't we be there by now?
Great.
We're playing that game now?
Don't worry.
We'll pass right through it.
Rainbows aren't solid.
Uh, The middle of town.
Yeah, you know, the one where I'm the guest of honor?
Yeah!
Um, I'm Rainbow Dash, and this is everypony.
I couldn't help noticing there are only three beds.
Okay, four.
Sorry, everypony.
I didn't know what I was getting you into.
Or Princess Twilight.
But probably me.
This is so weird!
Yeah, if we ever find him.
Pretty sure, yeah.
And the resort hotel wasn't what it was cracked up to be either.
No fan club?
Bring us here for nothing?
Mmm, yeah, I can see that.
Mayor, seriously, is there a fan club?
Ugh.
So, what's your plan?
Heh.
Let me try.
I mean, Rainbow's part of my name, right?
Ugh.
Yeah, that's all I got.
Are you okay?
Guys, guys, hold on!
It was just an accident.
Wait.
So you're the fan club?
Well, what do you know?
The mayor was telling the truth about something!
Somepony ask me!
Heh.
Well, you promise to listen and work hard and practice?
Heh, tell you what.
If I like what I see, the three of us will put on a show at the Rainbow Festival.
I think the whole town should know there's a couple of future Wonderbolts living here.
C'mon!
We got work to do!
All right, rookies.
Show me what you got.
Well?
Aren't you gonna fly or something?
Fancy flying is something you have to work up to.
Even I didn't become Rainbow Dash in one day.
Everypony's got to learn the basics before they can show off.
You'll get there.
But first, let's start with a single flip.
They've been practicing their tails off for the big show.
The Rainbow Festival.
They're the official entertainment.
Uh, landing still needs a little work.
Heh, whoa-ho-ho!
Nice stuff.
Oh-ho-ho.
Attention, everypony!
Introducing Hope Hollow's very own Junior Wonderbolts!
Okay, guys.
Showtime!
Heh.
Now this is something I'm proud to be a guest of honor for!
Leave her alone!
Keep making fun of her and find out!
Whaddya have in mind?
In history, maybe.
See you boys at the finish line!
Hey!
NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad!
Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash!
And you are?
You sure about that?
Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff.
Whoa!
You're awesome!
Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done!
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
What gives?
Um, Sure.
Pretty fast?
Please!
I'm even faster than that!
Um, that wouldn't really be fair.
I mean, you're a full-grown pony, and, Wait.
Are you an Alicorn?
Uh, actually, I just remembered I have somewhere I need to be.
What?
I can't do that!
Nopony can!
It's not even a real thing!
It's just an old mare's tale!
Ooookay, I'm gonna go now.
Whoa!
No way!
This is way more exciting!
Aw, man.
Whoooaaaa!
Aaaaaaah!
Okay, flight school!
Get ready for Rainbow Dash!
Hah?
whooooa!
This is so awesome!
Woo-hoooooo!
Adventure?! I'm in!
Or is it something awesome?!
Who am I?
That's Danger Dash to you!
But don't thank Danger Dash either.
Thank that weird voice that sent me out here.
Oh...
Sorry, Spike.
Let's take a look at that app.
And if there's ever any danger of being bored, I'll squash it on the double!
After all, I am Danger Dash!
Adventure is calling.
Feel along for the ride, pal?
You go for it.
Uh, Rarity, we're not in a fight.
Noice!
Huh?
Uh, this looks like a pony playing buckball on a mountain.
Or are they in a valley?
Yoink!
I've been looking for that.
What's the new oven's name?
Why?
He's not a Trail Trotter.
He's a walking disaster.
You saved the day!
Crazy that somepony could just make up a troop on the spot like that.
Aw, yeah...
Aw, thanks, little buddy!
It's nothing but a little hard work, natural talent, and all-consuming desire to be the best me I can be.
But I don't do it for the trophies.
I do it for the fans.
My buddies!
What's up?
But I don't even work here.
Thanks!
You know, of all the things I'm good at, my favorite is being friends with all of you!
Uh... what?
That makes no sense.
Why would I want to be the worst?
OH, NO, HE DID NOT!
I'll show you my worst, all right!
You'll rue the day you ever challenged Rainbow Dash!
The brash!
The crash!
The... mustache.
Wait, whaaaat?
Sit back and watch, everypony, as the best does her worst!
I can't say no to a friendly competition!
So... heavy... 
I'm so strong!
It would be an honor to turn this into a creative failure, Pinkie.
No, it's not!
It's terrible!
I have never seen anything worse.
Okay.
Now you're making me mad.
You don't need to explain it to!
Right.
Game face, on!
Nah, I'm good.
You okay, little dude?
What is the matter with you?
Don't you feel bad about being so... bad?
If you're such a big failure, then why are you succeeding at being such a jerk?
Well, I say it does.
You were a champion-level jerk when you painted over Pinkie's portrait!
And yet again when you broke Pinkie's sundae glass!
Twice!
Which means... we're tied!
A race?
How am I gonna lose that?
I know, but... ever since I was a filly, I could never back down from a challenge.
And nothing's challenged me like this in a long time.
There must be a way!
Maybe a potion will make me worse!
Nope.
Still awesome.
It's time.
You're gonna win soooo easily!
Okay, yeah, enough of this!
I'm a winner!
And winners gonna... WIIIIIIIN!
Thank you.
Good game.
I said good game.
Because that's the nice thing to do when you clobber an opponent.
Nah.
I'm good at being me.
Awesome, awesome me.
Uh... actually, I won.
Not to brag.
Okay, now that's a title I can get behind.
Plus, I don't do it to live up to anypony else's standards.
I do it for the fans!
By the way, Applejack, here's your book back.
Loved the symbolism!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Cloud security is such a fluffy gig.
You're kidding!
Sounds like an adventure to me!
It's not like anypony's gonna get hurt.
And look how happy Fluttershy is.
See?
Nothing to be afraid of, Applejack.
Yeah, they're right over there.
L-Let's see where these tracks go.
W-We just need to keep our wits about us.
I have to!
If I don't come back, tell the world my story!
It's even worse than I thought!
Fluttershy?
We thought you were Bighoof.
It's going long!
All the time in the world.
Uh-oh.
Is something wrong, Pinkie?
But aren't we just pretending to be a Trail Trotters troop?
More like in a dash!
You know, 'cause I'm so fast that I can control time?
So fast that even I
Chillax.
I'll head right over to Twilight's.
Ooh.
Uhhhh, what now?
A new Wonderbolt game is dropping today?
Top score!
Wait.
When did it become dark?
Oh, no.
I was supposed to deliver that thingamabob to what's-her-face!
I'll get it there in no time.
Got it.
Powerful device.
Waiting for me?
One decorator duplicator coming up.
Not... just... yet!
Whoa!
What's happening?
Rarity?
Applejack?
Pinkie?
Wait.
I'm not in Ponyville anymore?
Where am I?
Some sort of dystopian future?
Okay.
Very funny joke.
You mean... this was my fault?
Tank!
You're here!
And you talk?
Listen, buddy.
I've got to find my way back to fix this.
I've got to find a way out of here!
Taking time is what got me into this mess!
No time!
You're right.
I didn't take the time I needed to start with.
I wound up rushing into this pickle.
So, to get out of it... I need to stop... focus... be still.
Thank hoofness I found you!
You ever thought about doing some silver accents in your mane?
Stop... focus... be still.
Now let's throw a party!
Do you have any idea where you're going, Pinkie?
Cannonball!
Yeah, I have a better idea.
You swam in the pond.
Gonna be honest!
I don't love the dark!
Uh, no purple sparks around here.
Wait, wait, wait!
You're making it sound like a kitchen nightmare!
It wasn't scary.
Here's how it really happened.
Jam, ponies!
Discord's making his famous lava brownies, and we cannot be shown up!
Did we win an award?
I think we won for fastest baking.
Quick!
Unplug the mixing bowl!
S-Should we... follow that squirrel?
I-I don't know!
I panicked!
Maybe it's a balloon monster!
Maybe it's Balloonga the Destroyer!
Uh, I'm not good with names.
Quick!
Who's next?
Yup.
Story checks out.
Pinkie, you look nervous.
Oh, no!
Two sprinkles past four!
My bad.
And I just placed first in a wing-lifting competition.
Cool!
My turn!
I am the most awesome pony I know.
Hey, it works.
Truth is... I was gonna compete, but the new Daring Do book was just way too un-put-down-able!
And I've been thinking.
What if we use this opportunity to get a new mixer for the shop?
So glad you asked.
I'm gonna sell some of my nifty homemade crafted merch at the comet viewing.
Hats, silly straws in the shape of a comet's tail, actual cotton candy, and T-shirts!
Get your comet stuff!
Remember the thing you haven't done yet before it happens so you'll never forget it again after it does!
Yeah!
And they say I Saw the Comet and All I Got Was
What is it, Twilight?
I'm in the middle of a sale.
These... are... perfect!
I'm sorry.
Here you go!
I need those glasses.
What?
They're all sold out!
All of them!
How did this happen?
I know.
Dishwater's got the glasses!
I gotta investigate.
Here.
AJ, can I borrow that banana bandana?
How do I look?
It'll have to do.
Hello there.
Two hundred?
Hah!
That's ten times what they cost online!
No way, pal!
This is the worst!
Now nopony can afford the special glasses!
That's not helping!
And it's so much better because now all of us can share the awesomeness together.
Everypony, come look!
The comet's coming!
Who needs a new mixer when you're mixing it up with friends like this?
These snacks are stellar, Pinkie!
Yeah!
We all know something's up!
The sky will become a pastel, multicolored light show.
It'll be cool.
It's the Bake Day, baby!
I'm at an art gallery, but it's more like a 'fart gallery'.
These paintings stink.
Then it's settled.
She's gonna miss the stretch and warm-up.
She could pull a muscle.
All right, everypony!
Who's ready to work out?
And one!
Two!
Three!
What is your deal?
Pinkie, don't listen to him.
It's almost too cute!
Uh, you know what I'm craving?
Great dress rehearsal.
Tomorrow night will be a piece of cake.
Now I got it!
Explains the smell.
You ponies are the greatest to ever grace the stage, and I know about greatness.
Pre-show ritual on three!
One!
Two!
Three!
Uh, did we hook up the stage lights wrong?
Ooh.
Huh?
Seems like you're acting perfectly normal.
For you.
Should we do something?
I can't believe we're actually here at the Sportacular Spectacular!
I'm signed up for the hundred-meter gallop, buckball, and hoofball, and
So, according to the schedule, as long as the hundred-meter doesn't run over, I can dash over to tug-of-tail, then finish off the day with some buckball!
I won't even have time to sleep!
Nope.
I'll be in the arena the whole time takin' names and playin' games!
Let's see.
Apple bobbing, apple shot put, apple tennis... I think I'm still in the A's
Relax.
I'm fine.
It was just a tiny tumble.
We can't miss that!
Come on, everypony!
Hurry!
Ouch!
It hurts, but I-I'll just wing it.
No way!
Think of my reputation as the sportiest pony in Equestria!
I am unstoppable!
Okay, fine.
I might have to sit today out.
But I know I'm totally gonna heal up in time for something.
Until then, I-I just need to find a... substitute.
This'll do.
It won't give you my mad skills, but if you look like me, you might feel like me, and then you can play like me.
'Til I'm back on my hooves.
You look great, Flutterdash.
Come on, Flutterdash!
Ugh.
Did she get my message?
What is she doing?
This is all wrong!
Spike, call it off!
Just tell her to do what she wants!
I can't watch whatever happens next.
She's playing the game like Fluttershy, not like me!
And... she's amazing.
Go, Fluttershy, go!
You don't think my super-awesome rainbow bran muffin is exciting?
Uh, skydiving?
Uh... great manes think alike?
Um... a wild and crazy coincidence.
We weren't copying you.
Of course you're not, Twilight Sparkle.
Applejack's right.
I'm soooo hungry!
So hungry I could eat a... uh... ohhhh... I don't know, but something big!
I ate it faster.
If anyone's gonna whew, it's gonna be me!
Nuh-uh!
Glam!
Maximus glam!
Glam-o-rama!
I know best!
We're already having so much fun!
Come on, Tank!
We got this!
That's the wrong way!
Uh, do you think we
That's it, Tank!
Use your boosters!
Exactly.
I cared the least about winning.
So you might say I'm winning about caring the least about winning.
If I cared about that sort of thing.
Incoming!
Uh, Trixie, you might be confident in the magic part, but you might need to spend some time brushing up on the friendship part.
Just leave it to us, and we'll make you into a lean, mean, friendship-making machine!
I'll just take one last whiff of that fresh air before
Cannonball in the Creek?
Are there instructions inside?
This is detailed.
Even for Twilight.
No offense, but the lore-ing is a little boring.
Can't we just play?
Should we go after her?
Joust!
Joust!
Uh, detailed?
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
You should do an action movie!
Yes!
You were!
And I was finishing... a batch... of... frosting?
That was fun!
And we're all beasts!
I wish we were playing on the same time.
That way, we'd all win.
Wow, Twi!
You give new meaning to getting your head in the game!
You mean run for my honey!
I always run faster when I plant a jar of honey at the finish line.
Can't we sleep just a little longer...
I believe that's for me.
Equestria Presto instant delivery!
Almost got it!
Looking good, Apple-J!
Er, Applejack!
Pinkie Pie!
We missed you!
Did you miss us?
Half-Chomp Champion?
You always get my talents, Pinkie!
Pinkie, stage fright is no joke.
But we'll help you.
I'm game for whatever as long as it means more fun before we're done.
Those were all so cool!
Life is like a traveling circus.
Stay in motion, or the fun will end.
 But I don't want the fun to end!
They're already coming true!
Everypony's fortune was lucky.
But mine is just a bad sign.
You're right, Pinkie.
If I do what it says, then it won't come true.
Obviously I should join the circus!
If I travel all around Equestria, then the fun will never end!
I can't just stand around.
I gotta keep moving!
Or the fun will end!
Shining Armor!
Just the ringmaster I needed to see!
I want to join the circus.
And that's exactly what I need to do!
I'm in!
Now the fun will never end!
Take that, fortune!
Wait, what?
One plus four is more than the square root of of an apple pie-aye-ayeeeee!
I'm just not cut out to juggle so many things at once.
But that doesn't mean I'm a one-trick pony.
There's surely something
I... can't... STOP!
I am.
But something's just not right.
I've gotta see if Shining Armor has any acts left to try.
I know I was meant for the circus.
Give me another shot.
Count me in!
Uh... roar?
Because I was so busy worrying about my fortune, I totally forgot how when we're together, it's always a super-awesome rollercoaster of good times!
Things never stop moving here!
You betcha!
Welcome to Rainbow's Daring Danger Dash Show!
Now, everypony put your helmets on!
Rarity, what are you talking about?
Every single prop in our Play Day play vanished before our very eyes.
Soooo, uh... wait for them at Sugarcube Corner 'til they get back?
I'm the reason!
I wished for something really big... on the Cotton Candy Comet, and it clogged up the cosmos!
Now nopony's wishes are being granted!
What did you do?
Actually, we demand to know!
Hey, everypony!
Over there!
That Lightning Chill's gonna have a tummy ache if she doesn't slow down?
Here it is!
The Potion Ocean!
Isn't it just glori?
Ouch!
It's like you've lost the pep in your step.
Sorry about earlier.
We were just so excited to have you in our dimension.
Your serve!
Bet you can't score while I'm gone!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
You sure this is gonna work?
We did it!
Today is so boring.
I've already played every sport, read every comic, and crushed every video game.
Ugh.
Is this it?
Will I just wither into nothingness now?
Aah!
Who are you, strange and mysterious voice?
You're right!
I am more than this!
I am Danger Dash!
I'm training for the Sportacular Spectacular!
Hard work!
Determination!
Perseverance!
Stick-to-itiveness!
Yes!
Buuuut we gotta make it a surprise.
Knowing Discord, he'd do his usual chaos thing and ruin the party and our last hope.
Can we eat it?
It looks incredible.
I need to eat it!
Where's DJ Pon-3?
Twilight?
Spike?
Whoa!
Twilight Spikle!
Coooool!
Let's test 'em out!
Whoa!
Those are some wild moves.
I can see why you ruffled some feather boas at the Meet-and-Gallop last year.
You've just got to get out of your comfort zone.
And into the groove zone.
Yeah... No time!
All right, friends.
Bust a move!
Where's your pie, Pinkie?
Pinkie... 
Just a... a little under the weather.
But I-I'm fine.
D-Don't worry about me.
Oh, you shouldn't.
Unless it's not too much trouble?
We could just run away together...
We got so caught up in our own stuff, we forgot your competition!
I've always made a mean confetti cake.
Time to shine by slowing down time.
Whew.
Honestly, I didn't have the energy.
We're just so used to you helping us out, no questions asked.
Taking care of yourself first is important.
That way, you have something left in the tank to help out the ones you love.
But you need me here!
I... Ohhhh, wait.
Yeah, I see what I did there.
Where are we?
But did you see that robot mind control helmet?
They're trying to make her into one of them!
Not one step closer, you big metallic monsters!
Like how those other mecha-ponies helped our friend by pony-napping her?
I'll believe it when I see her.
Twilight, this is so obviously a trick.
Look at them.
They're big, shiny, metal, robo-pony-bots who
I'll fly up and see if I can spot another way in!
Twilight!
I knew it!
This is a trap!
Wait.
This is Sugarcube Corner.
Sucrose?
Sugarcube?
Wow!
Whoa!
It's almost the same on the inside!
Fluttershy!
I'm coming!
Oof!
Oh, no!
I'm too late!
They've made you into their mecha-pony queen!
You mean you haven't been assimilated yet?
What about their leader?
So you weren't pony-napped?
I'm sorry I was so quick to judge you based off the way you look.
Just because a mecha-pony is scary on the outside doesn't mean you're scary on the inside.
Ugh!
Yup.
A real hug machine.
Don't worry.
I have a plan.
Sorry, Pulverizer.
That's not a game.
It's Twilight's calculator.
Do you think we could have it back?
That's right.
My plan was just to ask.
Thank you.
I hope we see you again one day in the future.
Faster!
Yeah, things are not normal here.
Okay, we don't know what you're talking about.
We want answers!
Last year, when Trixie hosted it, it was amazingly incredible!
Especially since the Wild Siders are here.
But, Rarity, we're only six ponies.
But wait!
There's more!
This is going to be a stage adaptation of the true story of the fastest pony in Ponyville!
I've got you, Pinkie!
Heads up!
Come on, Pinkie!
You got this!
Maybe she don't got this.
Uh, you're dancing?
This is pretty cool, ponies.
But let's all agree not to let the viral fame go to our heads, okay?
Viral fame has gone to our heads!
Uh, yeah, uh, what a relief.
I guess this means we've gone back to normal.
Look at his little legs go!
You can count on us to put the action into reaction!
Right, Applejack?
Well, I haven't gone yet, but we need to go outside for it.
Warning  do not attempt this at home unless you're a trained professional.
Or me.
Maybe she's in the footage.
Uh, I think it's just outside.
Plus apple picking.
That... was... awesome!
And for my next trick...
Gotta go dash!
You could call this a cold case.
I'm sorry, Twilight.
Once the sun goes down, so do my eyelids.
I'm awake!
Definitely so awake!
You're sick!
You're no exception.
I already sent Twilight and Fluttershy home with acute cough-itis.
Hmmm...
Okay, Pinkie, off you go.
The cupcakes are in good hooves.
See ya!
Rest up.
Uh, these look edible-ish.
How are we doing on frosting, Rarity?
Yeah, may be time to crack open Pinkie's playbook.
Pickles?
She's delirious.
Phew!
Bet you barricading the door isn't in that binder.
Pull the blue lever!
And we're glad we listened to you and followed your directions.
Eventually.
We should've trusted you from the get-go.
Wait for it...
A Royal Jelly who-da-what-now?
Ooh.
A telepathy potion.
Very chill.
Look, Pinkie.
An audition needs something that's gonna grab their hearts, eyeballs, and advertisers!
She's camera-ready!
Looks like we're in a pretty
sticky situation.
And do something flashy!
Maybe we should've just believed in her from the start?
Yeah!
Thanks for helping me practice my moves, Twilight.
I am gonna be a breakdancing star!
I've never done the Dash Master before.
Whoaaaa!
Whoa.
That was a close caaaaall!
Uh, it seems like I'm getting sucked all the way in and the portal is closing up!
The portal's changing my voice!
How looooow can it gooooo?
Uh, yeah!
That would not be ideal!
Have you come to say seeeee yaaaaa laaaaateeeeer?
It was neeeeeveeeeer yooooour faaaaault.
Weeeee're iiiiin thiiiiis togeeeeetheeeeer.
Ooh, ooh!
Dance party to celebrate!
Who wants to see me do the Dash Master?
You can catch her at fencing later!
But you're a pro!
You said so yourself!
See?
Champion fainter right here.
Ooh, she can also cry on cue.
I'm sorry, Rarity.
All the rest of us have signed up for games, and I didn't want you sitting out.
I'm sure there's an activity for you.
This is the Sportacular Spectacular.
There's something for everypony here.
Even indoor ponies.
Freestyle debate ribbon-pinning?
It's not just being outside that's been so great.
It's being able to do so much stuff together with all of you!
My best friends!
I'm having a friendship flashback!
Yeah!
Sports!
Flashback over!
We're on a tight schedule!
Let's do this!
Uh, save it for the field.
Just a moment!
Emergency huddle!
Okay, ponies.
They're having us count off, but I've got a plan.
We'll line up next to each other, they'll split the group in two, and we'll face off against the other six.
Okay, okay!
Everypony, we're gonna get out of this huddle and say break!
 to prove that we all understand what's happening.
Okay?
Now let's get out there, line up next to each other, and get on the same team!
Ready?
Count off?
I think you mean split down the middle.
Emergency huddle!
I don't either!
Did somepony call the gardening squad?
Then I think it's time for some big, red, delicious water balloons!
Soooo... Nope.
As far as I can tell, they're still floating.
Hey, Spike!
Blow the biggest bubble you can!
Really go for it!
Way to go, Spike-o!
Uh-oh.
I gotta pop this thing!
A little help, friends?
The bubble is even stronger now!
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!
I gotta try that!
Um... Hah!
Easy-peasy!
A first place ribbon from the Sportacular Spectacular, when we all competed as a team!
Um, are you ponies seeing what I'm seeing?
Fluttershy's gonna be so stoked that we're all finally a troop!
Officially recognized by the Ponies Earning Badges Organization, L.
I came as fast as I could.
Uh-oh.
How are we gonna tell?
Uh, Pinkie?
Earning badges as a troop is super fun, but shouldn't we tell her it's not real?
Uh... a little longer can't hurt.
Teamwork in action!
Noice!
Hey, Fluttershy.
What we're trying to say is selling cookies just isn't fun like this.
I can't believe the Crystal Empire Carnival's back in town!
The moment that ribbon's cut, I am racing!
Oh, no.
The booth's boarded up.
Whoo-hoo!
Whooooaaaa!
Hey, Rarity.
I gotta play the mallet game.
I need total strangers to know how strong I am.
I'm in.
And... break!
Never mind!
You ponies dare me to win?
Oh, well.
I dare myself!
Ugh.
I'll just have my memory of this moment as my prize.
Anyone around or what?
 Of course I'm around.
I'm gonna answer, Yeah!
You OK?
 Wow.
Okay, Fluttershy.
Message received!
Time to reply in all caps!
I THINK SO!
Rarity!
Are you here to work out with me?
I've been here.
At the gym.
Nope.
But I heard about your heated
What if you apologize to her?
Come on, Applejack.
You got the advice you asked for.
We get it.
We gave you the same advice.
Where's the explosion?
What happens when you press it?
What?
Oh, my hoof-ness!
I need to download this app immediately!
I can't go another minute without being a part of the hilarity!
Aaaaaand... click to download!
I'm out of hard drive space!
I'm without space!
THERE!
SPACE!
Well, I could delete Baubles with Besties, but I like playing Baubles.
With my besties.
And I could delete Gossip-peroni, but then how will I learn all the latest celeb gossip while ordering delicious gooey pizza?
Hmmm.
I could delete Awooga.
It counts how many times you say awooga.
But then I won't know how many times I've said awooga.
Like just now!
That's another awooga!
I don't know.
I want to join in on the fun, but this is so not fun!
It even says awooga?
Okay, that's it!
I want in!
I need to delete something!
But what?
Twilight!
You've been so quiet!
I need your help!
Hey, Twi
Yeah, Twi?
This is super fascinating, but maybe we can jump into the part where you tell me what apps I should delete.
Okay, great!
I like where this is going!
I don't like where this went.
There's a but?
There's a but!
I don't like this but.
It's a bad but.
No two ways a-but it.
I can't delete either of them.
Sometimes I sleep-run, and it tracks that.
Oh, it logs every time something makes me go oooooh.
Yeah, those weren't ooh's.
The app's worth it.
Didn't count 'em.
Uh... I'm letting off some steam?
You do?
Awooga!
Awooga!
I don't need a soundboard app.
I am a soundboard app!
I'm Onomatopoeia!
ONOMATOPOEIA!
Hoo-ha!
Hoo-ha!
Hey, Fluttershy.
How's the unboxing video coming along?
