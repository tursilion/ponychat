What is up, everypony?
Big shout out to all my fans, the Pippsqueaks!
So, tonight's the night.
I can't wait to debut my new song later.
It has a very special place in my heart, but not as much as you guys!
Okay, guys, I love you lots.
Gotta go.
Pipp-Pipp-hooray!
Check it out, Pippsqueaks!
Live from the castle... it's a real unicorn and Earth pony!
I know, right?
This is so not a filter.
Zipp, what are you doing here?
Mom said to stay away.
For the content.
Everypony knows that only royals can fly, of course.
I know, it's not fair.
But that's just the way it is.
If there were some way we could teach the citizens to fly, you know we would in a wing beat.
Right, Zipp?
What the... What is happening?
Somepony seriously needs to explain why this thing was so important that you had to ruin my whole show over it!
You left me hanging there!
In the spotlight!
Now everypony knows we can't fly.
This is not happening!
This is so not happening!
Have you lost your mind?
I know a way out.
Come on.
It was supposed to be my best show ever.
And now it's all over.
I'm a criminal!
And that is so not cool.
Are you sure she even knows where to find this other crystal?
I don't know.
You are the one that just got Mom thrown in jail!
Any ideas, Zipp?
You know what would be even better?
Not being stuck in the middle of nowhere as outcasts from our own kingdom!
I don't think so!
My sparkle is aquamarine?
That's, like, my sixth favorite color!
It is gorgeoooous!
I so wish I had live-streamed that!
Yay, makeovers!
I love makeovers!
But if he wins, we'll lose both crystals.
You hear that, Sunny?
Feel the rhythm take you over.
You feelin' it?
Yeah, you are, Sunny!
Yeah, you do this, Sunny!
How did you find us?
Please, Mom.
Sunny!
We can't give up!
Sunny!
Whew... I'm okay!
Alphabittle, look out!
We're actually flying!
Stunning!
Where is she?
I really wanted to use my
What took you so long?
Don't tell me you were sneaking around the palace again.
You know you can just enter through the main doors.
It's our house.
Good point.
Okay, Sunny.
Just remember.
Pretend you're talking to us and not, like, all of Equestria, and you'll do great.
You're live... now!
Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
Turn into an Alicorn!
That's an Earth pony, Pegasus, and unicorn all in one!
You know iiiiit!
Okay, Sunny!
Do the thing!
This one goes out to my paranoid big sis Zipp.
I knew it!
You got me grounded, like, twelve times!
Like a rando thunderstorm?
And haaaaarmooooony!
Let's do it!
Showtiiiiime!
Don't you love it here at Mane Melody?
Adorbs!
It's going to be iiiicooooniiiic-kuh!
Hello, Pippsqueaks!
And welcome to the ultimate D.

This blank canvas is getting the royal treatment!
Big dreams for such a tiny little price!
Fan art!
Hey!
Design hack!
Picture wall!
How... much... further?
My ice sculpture's melting!
This is a total makeover fail!
Say besties!
That's all, Zippsters!
Like and subscriiiiibe!
It means flight school.
Over to you, captain.
UGHHHH!
Come on!
Oooh!
Cuuuute!
Yup!
Totally... fine!
Whew.
Hey, Zipp.
Just finishing up my packing.
Awwww, Zipp!
Bag?
About that...
Come on, Zipp.
Just one?
Don't you want to remember today?
Oh, I don't know.
How about the loving send-off from your mother?
The queen?
Yikes!
Huh?
Zipp, aren't you gonna miss Zephyr Heights?
Even a teeny bit?
Yeah, me, too.
All we really need is each other.
Hmm?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Ghooooost!
No-no-no-no-no!
Yeah, my bedsheet!
Thanks, Izzy!
I am, like, soooo super-traumatized right now.
I'll be lucky to get any sleep.
Uh, was that my tiara?
Sunny, you have to do something!
Izzy's becoming a total nightmare roommate!
What a lovely review.
Heh.
Thank you so much.
So, who is neeeeext?
That's me!
Welcome to Maaaaane Meeeeelo
Sooooo... um, what can I... do for you?
Uhhhhh... yeah.
I can't!
You saw what happened!
I took a huge chunk out of her mane!
Who's the style icon now?
Thanks for covering for me, Sunny.
And thanks for always being there for me, Zipp.
You're the best sister ever— Really?
You never let me style your mane!
Oh, my pony!
I always thought you'd look amazing with a pony perm!
Or, like, okay, a manehawk!
Or maybe in a different color!
Okay, okay!
How do you feel about bangs?
I love tours!
Yeah, I've always wanted to see the Houvre.
It's, like, a totally famous museum.
We love it!
Ponies!
Have you seen this ClipTrot?
It... is... so... awesooooome!
It's the Hip-Hop Bunny Bop!
The new dance craze?
It's only got, like, a million hooftaps!
We have to try it!
My Pippsqueaks will be expecting it!
Aaaaand five, six, seven, eight!
No, no, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Cut!
Stop!
Stop it!
I cannot upload that!
That was nothing like the bunnies!
Watch.
It goes like this.
Hey, Jazzy-babe!
Loving that hooficure!
Cuuuute!
So I could totally use your help on some, like, amazing content!
Aaaaand five, six, seven, eight!
No Canternet?
UGH!
So no one does the Hip-Hop Bunny Bop anymore?
The next big thing, huh?
Hmmm... Psssh!
Aaaaand... upload!
...how about you just be yourselves?
Yeah!
That's it!
You got it!
Mane Melody can't open without the mane attraction!
Yup, that was real.
Jazz gave them both hooficures.
Yeah, Sunny.
We know.
We're sorry, Izzy.
Excuse me.
Sorry!
Excusez-moi!
Can't believe I missed your pancakes this morning, Sunny!
But Mane Melody is totes slammed.
Okay, later, bye!
Izzy's not here either!
Maybe they're together?
Don't worry, Hitch.
We're, like totally gonna find them.
Not the face!
It's kinda spooky out here, right?
Aah!
I love it!
Instead of Sunday dinners, we have Sunny-day dinners!
Get it?
Totally a thing now.
