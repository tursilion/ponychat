And that's why we try not to keep our lunches in the lockers.
You're just mad that she dropped your class.
Give her a chance!
You can do this, Willow.
Don't let him beat you down.
Yeah, weird we've never seen you around.
What's your name?
Hey, I don't know what kinda mission you're on, but it's been a tough year for Willow.
And she's really looking forward to making this team a thing.
Don't mess this up for her.
Let's try this one more time!
So I can't fly like everyone else, but my way's more fun.
Oh, what was that?
Go, go, go!
Yeah, I shouldn't have been so suspicious.
The WHAT?
FRIENDS don't stab each other in the back.
He's worse than my dad.
Yeah, I know, I guess we'll just have to go home.
Well, it's been fun.
See you around, Luz the Human.
More like he begged us to come because he's terrified of getting recognized.
Eda was rummaging through her basement, and gave us some soothing human noises.
That was a few months ago.
She is shockingly strong!
Hooty, we're not gonna make Luz listen to 24 hours of whale noises.
What even is a whale?
It looks terrifying!
It's human music and it's soothing!
These two are train whistles in a thunderstorm and soothing opera screaming.
Luz!
You're okay!
Witch puberty.
That's cool, I just hope it helps Eda learn my name.
She keeps calling me Goops.
It's already spreading...
No, please!
Wait wait wait...
It finally happened!
Our memorable adventures caught up to us.
Oh, my dad can't find out about this!
(picks up leaf) I guess I'll have to start surviving off the land.
This is impossible!
Gus chomp!
That's right, we'll get back into Hexside or die trying!
Not with that attitude.
Ah, this is hopeless!
Nothing is working!
Help Luz!
Let me go!
No please, no!
Luz!
Save me!
No no no, I'll distract them with illusions of beautiful lady guards.
This could work!
You're stunting my growth as an artist!
Just let me try this!
You know, I think he does it cause he’s shy.
He’s just evil and shy.
It happens.
Maybe he’s so handsome people have a hard time focusing on what he says.
I get it… I can relate.
Luz!
You’ve seen Belos up close.
What’s he like under… all that?
Did you visit your mom?
Does she know about high-fives too?
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
Dad wants me to become a master illusionist, but that's easy.
So instead, I'll become an ambassador to the human realm and re-establish contact with the giraffes!
Would you still train to be a witch in the human realm?
What about all those hearts?
Hey.
You should say something.
You mean the real you.
I remember you!
Wait, get back here!
What are you doing here, Golden Guard?
I'll ask you one more time.
What are you doing here, Hunter?
How... vague of you.
Do you know where Luz is, by any chance?
I'm not sure what you're going through, but that much Hex Mix can't be good for your stomach.
Stop!
Don't trust him!
He's hiding behind an illusion!
You were gonna trick us into getting sigils!
No, no, stay back!
I said, stay..
BACK!
My spell, it's still active.
No, I- I don't know how, I've never made one this big before.
Hunter, why'd you save me back there?
From getting a sigil?
Don't those guys work for you?
When we first met you were trying to trick me into joining a coven.
No sandwich is that good.
Come on, if we wanna find a way through this, we need to trust each other.
What's going on with you?
Hunter!
Follow me!
Hey.
Try to breathe.
Like this.
Did you run away from the Emperor's Coven?
Not too long ago, when I showed a little talent and started taking more advanced classes, it always felt like anyone who wanted to be my friend had an ulterior motive.
Until I met Willow.
And, eventually Luz, and some others.
So yeah, not everybody's great, but not everybody's bad either, y'know?
For what it's worth, you can trust me.
I promise not to mess with you.
All right, tough guy.
Let's keep moving then.
Yes!
Yeah, we made it through the illusion!
High five!
Willow!
You're okay!
Oh, don't worry.
It's cool.
He helped me escape from Graye.
I think he ran away from the Emperor's Coven.
Also, he hasn't showered.
In a while.
Be nice.
Okay, let's get moving.
What are you doing?
Willow's on our side!
You've done it again, Augustus.
You can't even tell Willow apart from the fake one.
Yeah.
It's all my fault.
Ah, stop!
Wait, this hurts!
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I learn?
I let myself get tricked... again.
Everyone thinks I'm the smart one.
So why do I keep acting so dumb?
I can't even trust myself anymore.
Me too.
Just go with it.
Yeah.
and I almost went down with him.
Uh... probably?
I-I messed up bad, Luz.
Willow just needed help with this pixie problem, right?
So I thought, oh, that I'll lure them away with an illusion.
But then... I moved up two grades.
What's the point of being good at this if I can't do anything good with it?
Come on, King.
Please?
You need my library card to visit Amity, don't you?
Yeah, okay.
Looking through old newspapers is about all I'm good for anyway.
I-I've just been thinking.
What if it's time for me to explore different kinds of magic?
Wow!
Just wow!
Plants.
Abomination.
Construction.
You guys took down that Slitherbeast like it was nothing.
You're Glandus students, right?
I go to Hexside.
Name's Gus.
That sounds awesome, but I can't.
I promised a friend I'd help her with something today.
Luz!
I see what you're doing and it's really sweet, but I don't actually know any spells besides illusions.
Alright.
I'm in.
Where do we find these Galdorstones?
Yeah, um-Yeah.
Yeah, alright, let's go!
What can the Galdorstones actually do?
Pfft.
I know that.
Which one is this?
Fireball!
Don't worry, Matty.
I got ya.
What did they mean by couldn't handle Glandus?
Huh.
The Phantom Bringer.
Aleth the Vision Creator?
Khari the Mirage Maker.
But these titles are for... Oh no.
Stop!
These aren't ruins.
This is an illusionist graveyard.
What?
Of course it is.
These stones were theirs.
We shouldn't take them.
This isn't right.
I won't let you steal these.
I'm all out of glyphs!
Whoa-!
Uh, It'll just be an illusion, but maybe I can scare him away.
Well, we gotta get out of here.
Now.
Better a stooge than a clown.
Bria was right, illusions are nothing but high-def party tricks.
Thanks, Mattholomule.
It's time to teach those jerks a lesson!
With all due respect, sir, I'd like to try something a little more... creative.
Man, that took a lot of concentration.
There are some limits.
I wish I could repair all the damage they did.
But- there's so much history here!
So, does that mean we're like... friends now?
Jerk.
Hehahah!
Willow!
Hey, Willow!
Willow!
How are you feeling?
Do you have a fever?
Where's Willow?
Willow, you want me to sing for you?
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...
Why are we here?
Willow, is this helping?
Did we do bad?
No prob.
We're practically best friends now.
You've done it again, Augustus.
You've done it again, Augustus.
Why does this keep happening?
Oh, no.
No, no, not this!
Go away!
All of you!
