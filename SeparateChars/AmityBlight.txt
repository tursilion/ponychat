Edric!
Emira!
Stop bothering her!
Sorry, Luz, they insisted on coming for some reason.
They've been extra protective and nice towards me to make up for the library incident.
In any case, here's your book.
It was... fine.
When we're what?
Uh, sorry, but to be in my class, you need to take a placement exam and prove that you've mastered two spells.
I know you have your light thing.
Uh, do you know anything else?
Because if you don't, they'll put you in the baby class.
Sorry, whoever's over there!
What's that about the baby class?
I'm here to train.
I'm trying to beat Ed and Em's highest score on the exam.
Ahem.
I don't think the Owl Lady wants to show us any of her powerful spells.
Edric, don't eat that.
Luz!
And what are you doing with my wand?
I'm on it!
What?
Did you use this all up?
Edric!
Emira!
I am going after them.
You are staying here.
And because of you, it also has my brother and sister!
Now stay put.
You'll only get hurt.
Luz!
H-how did you get past the barrier?
But I can't do it without the wand!
Okay.
Luz!
Stop!
So it looks like we'll be in the same class.
As long as it's a secret club, okay?
Shut up.
Watch where you... Oh, it's you.
Ugh.
Put that away.
You're the one that got me in trouble with Principal Bump and I never get in trouble.
You can't be here!
This covention is for witches only.
Is that your ferocious demon there?
Oops.
That was an accident.
Because you and your pet are giving witches in training a bad name.
'Cause you can't.
I accept.
Let's set the terms for this duel, shall we?
Fine by me.
But when I win, not only do you have to tell the whole covention you're not a witch, you have to stop training forever.
The everlasting oath is sealed.
Meet back inside the theater in one hour.
Let's see what kind of witch you are.
Whoa.
Show me what you got, human!
How did you do that?
I-I saw you that time!
You didn't use your hands!
What are you getting at?
How are you doing that?
Why, Luz?
What happens if I step closer?
I knew it!
You were cheating!
Who could believe anything you say?
Hey!
But... I didn't know!
Ugh, seriously?
Just leave me alone.
That's all you ever do!
First at school, and now this!
You made me look like a fool in front of the Emperor's Coven.
My future!
You think it's so easy to be a witch.
I have been working my whole life to get to the top!
You lost!
You cheated!
Say it! Say you're not a witch!
That's nothing.
A child could do a light spell.
But... I've never seen it cast like that.
The oath is unbound.
Humans have no magical ability.
But I doubt that'll stop you.
Watch it, nitwit!
Hi, Luz... and co.
Sorry about that.
It's just, it's... private.
They're not for decoration.
This arena's where I'll make my debut as Grom queen.
Because this isn't just some dance party.
That's Grom. Short for Grometheus, the Fear-Bringer.
It's a monster that lives under the school.
Every year it tries to break out, and a student had to defeat it before it invades the town.
Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition.
The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shape-shift into your worst fear.
And mine... is very embarrassing.
No, but that's a good idea.
Thanks, Luz.
And here I thought this day... couldn't get any worse.
He said no.
I'm Grom queen, unless I can find a replacement.
And who'd want to switch with me?
What?
If that bird-tube ever talks to me again, I'm going to destroy it.
You ready to train?
Luz, you need to take this seriously.
If you can't defeat Grom, everyone on the island will have to live out their worst nightmare.
Grom will transform into your darkest fears.
What are you afraid of, Luz?
Not enough.
The reason I can't face Grom... it goes deeper than things that just gross me out.
What's your real fear, Luz?
Luz, I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time.
Uh, you look nice.
Strange, but... nice.
And, thank you, Luz.
Honestly, I'm kind of amazed with how fearless you are.
You've done things I could never do.
In your dreams.
Stay away from her!
I'm sorry, Luz.
I should have fought my own battle.
Really?
Well, then, if that's settled, may I have this dance?
Oh, it’s... not important.
Leave her alone.
It's not her fault she was born without talent.
Wow.
You're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into ya.
Oh, Willow.
You don't have anything to show, do you?
Oh, looks like someone wants to say something to you.
Abomination, rise.
It's like mine.
But much smaller and meaningless.
As top student, it's my duty to tell you to keep at it.
Even you could get a passing grade someday.
See you in class, superstar.
Excuse me, sir, but I am ready to present my abomination.
Last time I saw you, your abomination was mush.
What did you do?
I bet you did.
I've got my eyes on you, Half-a-Witch.
That badge is mine.
I saw that!
Abominations don't eat!
I know you're in there!
You can't hide from me.
What are you?
Who are you?
I want answers!
Huh?
Look at it.
But... they're getting away!
Not so fast!
I'm not letting you get away so easily.
I want my badge!
Thank you, Braxas.
See you next time.
Ugh!
It's for extra credit.
Don't get your leggings in a bunch.
Do you see me going to the Owl Shack and bugging you while you... fry up owls?
Okay, I don't really know what you do there, but every time you come near me, I get in trouble.
Just leave me alone.
She is not my friend.
You can leave now.
All of you.
Hey!
Really?
You two are the worst.
But you... I've been trying to figure out what your deal is.
Are, are you a poser? A nerd? 
I know. You're a bully, Luz.
First you embarrass me.
Then you wanna be my friend?
I don't get you.
Pick a side.
Just go away before things somehow get worse.
Luz!
Luz!
Huh?
Why are you doing this?
I've been reading you since I was a kid.
I know you're not like this.
Someone changed you.
Luz!
Well, it doesn't matter.
We're gonna be stuck together forever.
What are you doing?
Now what?
Luz!
Luz has to right a wrong.
Luz, quick.
Hey, it's okay.
We're still friends.
This never happened.
Thank you.
Maybe you aren't a bully.
I haven't exactly been the friendliest witch either.
I'll think on that.
Hey, Luz!
Congrats on getting in.
And not being in the baby class.
So, you two go to the same school now, that doesn't change anything.
Huh?
And that concludes the presentation from the Abomination track.
Are these made of real insect wings?
I'm a Blight.
We only associate with a select few.
Keep annoying me though, I'm happy to select fewer.
Oh no.
Yep, just a super cute ghost.
But they're all mine!
I'm sorry.
But I have to do this.
Huh?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no!
Um, uh....
Oh, come on!
I-I saved as many as I could!
Ugh!
Why would they make memories so flammable!
So, this is the Owl House.
And you... sleep here?
Willow might not want me in there.
Okay, I'll do what I can.
Where's her Inner Willow?
Do you really think it'll help?
Luz?
Luz!
Aah!
This is where Willow and I took swimming lessons!
The ash must be from the fires.
One time Willow wanted to play hooky from our swim lessons, so we built this!
We knew the swim teacher would be on the prowl, but Willow said she'd protect us with an illusion spell.
Wait, something is missing.
We're back!
Willow was a... late bloomer.
Wait!
Uhh.
You want important moments?
This one might be about a crush!
Yeah, Willow threw up a lot that day.
That's when you knew she was havin' fun.
Yeah, I just... I can't believe I almost erased all of this.
I really messed things up.
We can fix this together.
What's that!
No, I actually saw something!
At least I... I think I did.
Yeah, that one's hard to explain.
We're getting pretty good at fixing these.
But let's skip it!
Where's Eda's bell?
All you're doing is prying into your friends lives!
Well, did you ever think maybe it's none of your business?
Is something... burning?
Hide, hide, hide!
Please call Eda, I don't wanna be here when it comes out!
Why won't she answer?
Why is it destroying all the photos?
We can't go in there, I'm in there!
Are you... the Inner Willow?
You're just hurting Willow.
Why are you doing this?
Wait!
Before all this started, there... there was something else.
Willow, you were never too weak to be my friend.
I was too weak to be yours.
I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise you this.
I won't let Boscha and her gang pick on you ever again!
I'm not actually gonna rip it because it's a real butterfly, but you get the gesture, right?
Me too.
I'm not sure.
Oh, please!
You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition.
But I grew up.
When will you?
Oh, Luz!
You’re here!
I mean, obviously you’re here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me...
I’ve been talking for too long.
Yes, I can help... With what, exactly?
Yeah, this time of year, she’s extra unbearable.
Uh, the hard part is, there’s no reasoning with Boscha.
She only speaks in Grudgby terms.
I’m... not putting anything down.
Luz, this isn’t a good idea.
On a team with you?
Running around in cute uniforms?
I gotta go!
Tough practice?
Did you know, before Boscha, I was the Grudgby team captain?
Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget.
We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship.
We had a move planned, and it was a good one.
But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier.
I changed our game plan to... the Thorn Vault.
Uh, yeah.
It went disastrously wrong.
My teammates got hurt.
All because I had an idea of how things should be.
I pushed them too far.
I never played again after that day.
Luz needs our help!
I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head.
She can be so stupid, which I love... I mean hate!
In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet... I mean, I hate it, and it’s dumb!
Nah.
I think I made it better.
Yeah!
There’s time for one more play.
Watch out!
Luz!
I think... I think I hurt my leg.
But, I’ll be okay.
I’m fine!
Oh, wow.
