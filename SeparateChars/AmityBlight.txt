Edric!
Emira!
Stop bothering her!
[helps Luz up]
Sorry, Luz, they insisted on coming for some reason.
[shoves Emira off]
They've been extra protective and nice towards me to make up for the library incident.
[shoves Edric away, pulls book out of bag]
In any case, here's your book.
It was...
fine.
[blushes, destroys drawing]
When we're what?
Uh, sorry, but to be in my class, you need to take a placement exam and prove that you've mastered two spells.
[shows the requirements on the pamphlet]
I know you have your light thing.
Uh, do you know anything else?
Because if you don't, they'll put you in the baby class.
Sorry, whoever's over there!
[walking toward them]
What's that about the baby class?
I'm here to train.
I'm trying to beat Ed and Em's highest score on the exam.
Ahem.
I don't think the Owl Lady wants to show us any of her powerful spells.
[leaves]
Edric, don't eat that.
[puts her book and wand into her tent, walks off]
Luz!
And what are you doing with my wand?
I'm on it!
[runs forward and tries to cast with her wand, fails]
What?
Did you use this all up?
Edric!
Emira!
I am going after them.
You are staying here.
[advances on Luz]
And because of you, it also has my brother and sister!
Now stay put.
[pauses]
You'll only get hurt.
Luz!
H-how did you get past the barrier?
But I can't do it without the wand!
Okay.
Luz!
Stop!
[fixes her hair and approaches Luz]
So it looks like we'll be in the same class.
[blushing]
As long as it's a secret club, okay?
[sighs]
Shut up.
Watch where you-- Oh, it's you.
Willow's...
abomination thing.
Ugh.
Put that away.
You're the one that got me in trouble with Principal Bump and I never get in trouble.
[walks away]
[stops and turns around]
You can't be here!
This covention is for witches only.
[looks over Luz's shoulder]
Is that your ferocious demon there?
Oops.
That was an accident.
Because you and your pet are giving witches in training a bad name.
'Cause you can't.
I accept.
Let's set the terms for this duel, shall we?
Fine by me.
But when I win, not only do you have to tell the whole covention you're not a witch, you have to stop training forever.
The everlasting oath is sealed.
Meet back inside the theater in one hour.
[walks away]
Let's see what kind of witch you are.
Abomination.
Rise.
[tracing out a large spell circle]
Abomination.
Rise.
[gasps]
Whoa.
Show me what you got, human!
How did you do that?
[screams]
I-I saw you that time!
You didn't use your hands!
What are you getting at?
How are you doing that?
Why, Luz?
What happens if I step closer?
I knew it!
You were cheating!
Who could believe anything you say?
Hey!
What are you--
[rubbing the back of her neck]
But...
I didn't know!
Ugh, seriously?
Just leave me alone.
That's all you ever do!
First at school, and now this!
[stands]
You made me look like a fool in front of the Emperor's Coven.
My future!
You think it's so easy to be a witch.
I have been working my whole life to get to the top!
[advancing on Luz]
You lost!
You cheated!
Say it!
Say you're not a witch!
[turns away]
That's nothing.
A child could do a light spell.
But...
I've never seen it cast like that.
[sighs]
The oath is unbound.
[lets Luz go and stands]
Humans have no magical ability.
But I doubt that'll stop you.
Watch it, nitwit!
Hi, Luz...
and co.
Sorry about that.
It's just, it's...
private.
[offscreen]
They're not for decoration.
This arena's where I'll make my debut as Grom queen.
[grabs a sword]
Because this isn't just some dance party.
That's Grom.
Short for Grometheus, the Fear-Bringer.
It's a monster that lives under the school.
Every year it tries to break out, and a student had to defeat it before it invades the town.
Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition.
The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shape-shift into your worst fear.
And mine...
[looks at the blade of the sword]
is very embarrassing.
[returns the sword]
[chuckles]
No, but that's a good idea.
Thanks, Luz.
[sighs]
And here I thought this day...
Oop!
...couldn't get any worse.
[sigh]
He said no.
I'm Grom queen, unless I can find a replacement.
And who'd want to switch with me?
What?
If that bird-tube ever talks to me again, I'm going to destroy it.
You ready to train?
Luz, you need to take this seriously.
If you can't defeat Grom, everyone on the island will have to live out their worst nightmare.
Grom will transform into your darkest fears.
What are you afraid of, Luz?
Not enough.
[walks up to Luz as the illusions vanish]
The reason I can't face Grom-- it goes deeper than things that just gross me out.
[pokes Luz]
What's your real fear, Luz?
Luz, I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time.
Uh, you look nice.
Strange, but...
nice.
[puts her hands on Luz's shoulders]
And, thank you, Luz.
Honestly, I'm kind of amazed with how fearless you are.
You've done things I could never do.
[laughs]
In your dreams.
[quietly]
Luck.
[makes noise]
Stay away from her!
I'm sorry, Luz.
I should have fought my own battle.
I-- [eyes glow]
Really?
Well, then, if that's settled, may I have this dance?
[blushing]
Oh, it’s...
t’s not important.
[sighs]
Leave her alone.
It's not her fault she was born without talent.
[looks away from her book]
Willow!
Wow.
[hops off the pot]
You're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into ya.
[chuckles]
Uh, shouldn't you get to class early to prep your...
Oh, Willow.
You don't have anything to show, do you?
[sighs]
This is why people call you Half-a-Witch Willow.
Oh, looks like someone wants to say something to you.
[takes the cover off her pot]
Abomination, [snaps]
rise.
It's like mine.
[readjusts a star shaped badge that reads Top Student]
But much smaller and meaningless.
As top student, it's my duty to tell you to keep at it.
[puts an arm around Willow]
Even you could get a passing grade someday.
Abomination, cower.
See you in class, superstar.
Excuse me, sir, but I am ready to present my abomination.
Rise!
[growls and reaches for her badge]
But...
Hey.
Last time I saw you, your abomination was mush.
What did you do?
I bet you did.
I've got my eyes on you, Half-a-Witch.
That badge is mine.
[She walks backwards, not breaking eye contact with Willow even as she bumps into another student.
[jumps onto the table]
I saw that!
Abominations don't eat!
I know you're in there!
You can't hide from me.
What are you?
Who are you?
I want answers!
[grabs Luz by her shirtfront and shakes her violently]
[stops shaking Luz]
Huh?
But I-- No!
Look at it.
But--
They're getting away!
[blocking the way]
Not so fast!
I'm not letting you get away so easily.
I want my badge!
Abominations, seize!
[offscreen]
 'What do you think you're doing?
 'We're your friends and we wanna help,' said the Tin Boy with a yelp.
Otabin smiled and paced the floor.
'I've never had real friends before.
 'Then we'll be your first,' the Chicken Witch clucked.
Otabin couldn't believe his luck.
So, Bookmaker Otabin surrounded by friends, bound a book of friendship and that's the end.
[pats his head]
Thank you, Braxas.
See you next time.
Ugh!
You.
It's for extra credit.
[picks up the book Luz dropped]
Don't get your leggings in a bunch.
[walks to the back of the room]
[slams her pile of books on a table]
Human!
[faces Luz]
Do you see me going to the Owl Shack and bugging you while you...
fry up owls?
[scoffs]
Okay, I don't really know what you do there, but every time you come near me, I get in trouble.
Just leave me alone.
[grunts as her face turns bright red]
[stalks over and grabs the bag]
She is not my friend.
You can leave now.
All of you.
[walks back into the kid's corner]
Hey!
[grunts]
Phew!
Almost passed out.
Really?
[mad]
You two are the worst.
[takes her diary from Luz, sounding hurt]
But you...
I've been trying to figure out what your deal is.
Are, are you a poser?
A nerd?
I know.
You're a bully, Luz.
[runs off]
First you embarrass me.
Then you wanna be my friend?
I don't get you.
Pick a side.
Just go away before things somehow get worse.
Otabin?
[grunts]
Luz!
[screams]
Luz!
[grunts, gasps]
[yelps]
Huh?
[gasps]
Why are you doing this?
I've been reading you since I was a kid.
I know you're not like this.
Someone changed you.
[gasps]
Azura?
Luz!
Great work, Luzura.
Well, it doesn't matter.
We're gonna be stuck together forever.
What are you doing?
[grunts]
Now what?
[stares at her and chuckles]
Luz!
[screams]
[gasps, pulls a pencil out of her pocket and writes in the giant book]
Luz has to right a wrong.
Luz, quick.
[tosses the eraser]
Hey, it's okay.
We're still friends.
This never happened.
[takes it]
Thank you.
[starts to walk away, stops; sighs and turns around]
Maybe you aren't a bully.
I haven't exactly been the friendliest witch either.
I'll think on that.
[walks away]
[her abomination mirroring her movements]
Hey, Luz!
Congrats on getting in.
And not being in the baby class.
[to herself]
So, you two go to the same school now, that doesn't change anything.
[sighs]
Huh?
And that concludes the presentation from the Abomination track.
Abomination, fight!
Are these made of real insect wings?
I'm a Blight.
We only associate with a select few.
Keep annoying me though, I'm happy to select fewer.
[walks off]
Oh no.
Yep, just a super cute ghost.
But they're all mine!
[slams door]
[takes down the photo]
Willow, [sighs]
I'm sorry.
But I have to do this.
Huh?
[turns around]
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no!
[approaches the photo]
Um, uh....
Oh, come on!
....
I-I saved as many as I could!
Ugh!
Why would they make memories so flammable!
[looking around]
So, this is the Owl House.
And you...
sleep here?
Willow might not want me in there.
[sighs]
Okay, I'll do what I can.
Where's her Inner Willow?
Do you really think it'll help?
Luz?
Luz!
Aah!
Lake Lacuna!
This is where Willow and I took swimming lessons!
The ash must be from the fires.
[gasps]
Our fort!
In the dunes!
One time Willow wanted to play hooky from our swim lessons, so we built this!
[shoves a plank in Luz's hands]
We knew the swim teacher would be on the prowl, but Willow said she'd protect us with an illusion spell.
[looks at the fort in pride]
Wait, something is missing.
There.
[looks around]
We're back!
Willow was a...
late bloomer.
Wait!
Uhh.
You want important moments?
[gestures to the awkward hair day picture]
This one might be about a crush!
[smiles nervously]
Yeah, Willow threw up a lot that day.
That's when you knew she was havin' fun.
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe I almost erased all of this.
I really messed things up.
[smiles]
We can fix this together.
[blushes]
I just...
[gasps, points]
What's that!
No, I actually saw something!
At least I...
I think I did.
Wait, that's not--
Yeah, that one's hard to explain.
We're getting pretty good at fixing these.
Avoid?
But let's skip it!
Where's Eda's bell?
Help?
All you're doing is prying into your friends lives!
Well, did you ever think maybe it's none of your business?
[sniffs]
Is something...
urning?
Hide, hide, hide!
Please call Eda, I don't wanna be here when it comes out!
[ringing the bell with every word]
Why won't she answer?
Why is it destroying all the photos?
What?
We can't go in there, I'm in there!
Luz.
Are you...
the Inner Willow?
You're just hurting Willow.
Why are you doing this?
Wait!
Please.
Before all this started, there-- there was something else.
Willow, you were never too weak to be my friend.
I was too weak to be yours.
I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise you this.
[grabs Skara's invite out of her pocket]
I won't let Boscha and her gang pick on you ever again!
[tugs on Skara's invite]
I'm not actually gonna rip it because it's a real butterfly, but you get the gesture, right?
[pockets the invite, holds out her hand]
[full of emotion]
Me too.
I'm not sure.
[entering]
Oh, please!
You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition.
But I grew up.
When will you?
Oh, Luz!
You’re here!
I mean, obviously you’re here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me...
I’ve been talking for too long.
Yes, I can help...
With what, exactly?
Yeah, this time of year, she’s extra unbearable.
Uh, the hard part is, there’s no reasoning with Boscha.
She only speaks in Grudgby terms.
[looking at the books she's holding]
I’m...
not putting anything down.
Luz, this isn’t a good idea.
On a team with you?
Running around in cute uniforms?
Sweating?
[Amity blushes heavily, then runs off]
I gotta go!
Tough practice?
[sits down next to Luz]
Did you know, before Boscha, I was the Grudgby team captain?
Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget.
[voiceover]
We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship.
We had a move planned, and it was a good one.
But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier.
I changed our game plan to...
the Thorn Vault.
Uh, yeah.
It went disastrously wrong.
My teammates got hurt.
All because I had an idea of how things should be.
I pushed them too far.
I never played again after that day.
[gasps]
[slams open the door]
Luz needs our help!
I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head.
She can be so stupid, which I love— I mean hate!
In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet— I mean, I hate it, and it’s dumb!
Just, here.
Right here.
[looks at Willow and Luz]
Nah.
I think I made it better.
Yeah!
[laughs happily]
There’s time for one more play.
Watch out!
Luz!
I think— I think I hurt my leg.
But, I’ll be okay.
[blushing and chuckling nervously]
I’m fine!
Who’s Amity?
[chuckling nervously]
Oh, wow.
Sports.
