Edric!
Emira!
Stop bothering her!
Sorry, Luz, they insisted on coming for some reason.
They've been extra protective and nice towards me to make up for the library incident.
In any case, here's your book.
It was... fine.
When we're what?
Uh, sorry, but to be in my class, you need to take a placement exam and prove that you've mastered two spells.
I know you have your light thing.
Uh, do you know anything else?
Because if you don't, they'll put you in the baby class.
Sorry, whoever's over there!
What's that about the baby class?
I'm here to train.
I'm trying to beat Ed and Em's highest score on the exam.
Ahem.
I don't think the Owl Lady wants to show us any of her powerful spells.
Edric, don't eat that.
Luz!
And what are you doing with my wand?
I'm on it!
What?
Did you use this all up?
Edric!
Emira!
I am going after them.
You are staying here.
And because of you, it also has my brother and sister!
Now stay put.
You'll only get hurt.
Luz!
H-how did you get past the barrier?
But I can't do it without the wand!
Okay.
Luz!
Stop!
So it looks like we'll be in the same class.
As long as it's a secret club, okay?
Shut up.
Watch where you... Oh, it's you.
Ugh.
Put that away.
You're the one that got me in trouble with Principal Bump and I never get in trouble.
You can't be here!
This covention is for witches only.
Is that your ferocious demon there?
Oops.
That was an accident.
Because you and your pet are giving witches in training a bad name.
'Cause you can't.
I accept.
Let's set the terms for this duel, shall we?
Fine by me.
But when I win, not only do you have to tell the whole covention you're not a witch, you have to stop training forever.
The everlasting oath is sealed.
Meet back inside the theater in one hour.
Let's see what kind of witch you are.
Whoa.
Show me what you got, human!
How did you do that?
I-I saw you that time!
You didn't use your hands!
What are you getting at?
How are you doing that?
Why, Luz?
What happens if I step closer?
I knew it!
You were cheating!
Who could believe anything you say?
Hey!
But... I didn't know!
Ugh, seriously?
Just leave me alone.
That's all you ever do!
First at school, and now this!
You made me look like a fool in front of the Emperor's Coven.
My future!
You think it's so easy to be a witch.
I have been working my whole life to get to the top!
You lost!
You cheated!
Say it! Say you're not a witch!
That's nothing.
A child could do a light spell.
But... I've never seen it cast like that.
The oath is unbound.
Humans have no magical ability.
But I doubt that'll stop you.
Watch it, nitwit!
Hi, Luz... and co.
Sorry about that.
It's just, it's... private.
They're not for decoration.
This arena's where I'll make my debut as Grom queen.
Because this isn't just some dance party.
That's Grom. Short for Grometheus, the Fear-Bringer.
It's a monster that lives under the school.
Every year it tries to break out, and a student had to defeat it before it invades the town.
Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition.
The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shape-shift into your worst fear.
And mine... is very embarrassing.
No, but that's a good idea.
Thanks, Luz.
And here I thought this day... couldn't get any worse.
He said no.
I'm Grom queen, unless I can find a replacement.
And who'd want to switch with me?
What?
If that bird-tube ever talks to me again, I'm going to destroy it.
You ready to train?
Luz, you need to take this seriously.
If you can't defeat Grom, everyone on the island will have to live out their worst nightmare.
Grom will transform into your darkest fears.
What are you afraid of, Luz?
Not enough.
The reason I can't face Grom... it goes deeper than things that just gross me out.
What's your real fear, Luz?
Luz, I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time.
Uh, you look nice.
Strange, but... nice.
And, thank you, Luz.
Honestly, I'm kind of amazed with how fearless you are.
You've done things I could never do.
In your dreams.
Stay away from her!
I'm sorry, Luz.
I should have fought my own battle.
Really?
Well, then, if that's settled, may I have this dance?
Oh, it’s... not important.
Leave her alone.
It's not her fault she was born without talent.
Wow.
You're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into ya.
Oh, Willow.
You don't have anything to show, do you?
Oh, looks like someone wants to say something to you.
Abomination, rise.
It's like mine.
But much smaller and meaningless.
As top student, it's my duty to tell you to keep at it.
Even you could get a passing grade someday.
See you in class, superstar.
Excuse me, sir, but I am ready to present my abomination.
Last time I saw you, your abomination was mush.
What did you do?
I bet you did.
I've got my eyes on you, Half-a-Witch.
That badge is mine.
I saw that!
Abominations don't eat!
I know you're in there!
You can't hide from me.
What are you?
Who are you?
I want answers!
Huh?
Look at it.
But... they're getting away!
Not so fast!
I'm not letting you get away so easily.
I want my badge!
Thank you, Braxas.
See you next time.
Ugh!
It's for extra credit.
Don't get your leggings in a bunch.
Do you see me going to the Owl Shack and bugging you while you... fry up owls?
Okay, I don't really know what you do there, but every time you come near me, I get in trouble.
Just leave me alone.
She is not my friend.
You can leave now.
All of you.
Hey!
Really?
You two are the worst.
But you... I've been trying to figure out what your deal is.
Are, are you a poser? A nerd? 
I know. You're a bully, Luz.
First you embarrass me.
Then you wanna be my friend?
I don't get you.
Pick a side.
Just go away before things somehow get worse.
Luz!
Luz!
Huh?
Why are you doing this?
I've been reading you since I was a kid.
I know you're not like this.
Someone changed you.
Luz!
Well, it doesn't matter.
We're gonna be stuck together forever.
What are you doing?
Now what?
Luz!
Luz has to right a wrong.
Luz, quick.
Hey, it's okay.
We're still friends.
This never happened.
Thank you.
Maybe you aren't a bully.
I haven't exactly been the friendliest witch either.
I'll think on that.
Hey, Luz!
Congrats on getting in.
And not being in the baby class.
So, you two go to the same school now, that doesn't change anything.
Huh?
And that concludes the presentation from the Abomination track.
Are these made of real insect wings?
I'm a Blight.
We only associate with a select few.
Keep annoying me though, I'm happy to select fewer.
Oh no.
Yep, just a super cute ghost.
But they're all mine!
I'm sorry.
But I have to do this.
Huh?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no!
Um, uh...
Oh, come on!
I-I saved as many as I could!
Ugh!
Why would they make memories so flammable!
So, this is the Owl House.
And you... sleep here?
Willow might not want me in there.
Okay, I'll do what I can.
Where's her Inner Willow?
Do you really think it'll help?
Luz?
Luz!
Aah!
This is where Willow and I took swimming lessons!
The ash must be from the fires.
One time Willow wanted to play hooky from our swim lessons, so we built this!
We knew the swim teacher would be on the prowl, but Willow said she'd protect us with an illusion spell.
Wait, something is missing.
We're back!
Willow was a... late bloomer.
Wait!
Uhh.
You want important moments?
This one might be about a crush!
Yeah, Willow threw up a lot that day.
That's when you knew she was havin' fun.
Yeah, I just... I can't believe I almost erased all of this.
I really messed things up.
We can fix this together.
What's that!
No, I actually saw something!
At least I... I think I did.
Yeah, that one's hard to explain.
We're getting pretty good at fixing these.
But let's skip it!
Where's Eda's bell?
All you're doing is prying into your friends lives!
Well, did you ever think maybe it's none of your business?
Is something... burning?
Hide, hide, hide!
Please call Eda, I don't wanna be here when it comes out!
Why won't she answer?
Why is it destroying all the photos?
We can't go in there, I'm in there!
Are you... the Inner Willow?
You're just hurting Willow.
Why are you doing this?
Wait!
Before all this started, there... there was something else.
Willow, you were never too weak to be my friend.
I was too weak to be yours.
I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise you this.
I won't let Boscha and her gang pick on you ever again!
I'm not actually gonna rip it because it's a real butterfly, but you get the gesture, right?
Me too.
I'm not sure.
Oh, please!
You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition.
But I grew up.
When will you?
Oh, Luz!
You’re here!
I mean, obviously you’re here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me...
I’ve been talking for too long.
Yes, I can help... With what, exactly?
Yeah, this time of year, she’s extra unbearable.
Uh, the hard part is, there’s no reasoning with Boscha.
She only speaks in Grudgby terms.
I’m... not putting anything down.
Luz, this isn’t a good idea.
On a team with you?
Running around in cute uniforms?
I gotta go!
Tough practice?
Did you know, before Boscha, I was the Grudgby team captain?
Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget.
We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship.
We had a move planned, and it was a good one.
But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier.
I changed our game plan to... the Thorn Vault.
Uh, yeah.
It went disastrously wrong.
My teammates got hurt.
All because I had an idea of how things should be.
I pushed them too far.
I never played again after that day.
Luz needs our help!
I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head.
She can be so stupid, which I love... I mean hate!
In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet... I mean, I hate it, and it’s dumb!
Nah.
I think I made it better.
Yeah!
There’s time for one more play.
Watch out!
Luz!
I think... I think I hurt my leg.
But, I’ll be okay.
I’m fine!
Oh, wow.
The author of Azura is having a signing this afternoon at the Book Nook!
You are much less excited than I imagined.
No, she's not.
She's from the Demon Realm.
How do you think I got my books?
Do you think she has her own portal?
Do you think she's related to that human guy?
Okay, these theories are a little unrealistic.
It's obviously your mother as a teenager sent forward in time to train you in the ways of witchcraft!
I- I don't know.
I've never found another store that sold these books.
I think that's her.
That's the author!
Maybe it's another shape-shifting Basilisk trying to write their story through metaphor!
Tinella Nosa?
I-I didn't know.
I swear!
So, are you upset?
Well, I had fun coming up with those theories.
They were like our own stories.
What would be our first writing prompt?
Someone has to tell Mom about the Draining Spell or else she and dad are helping Belos hurt people.
I can't believe Mom broke it!
I'm gonna fix it, and I'm gonna get a message out to Luz.
I-I'm gonna do something!
If only Mom would just, hear us out!
Dad would listen.
I know he would.
The world is ending, no one'll listen to us and I just, I just wanna know that Luz is safe!
Probably something dorky, but also sweet.
Like how I shouldn't give up and that anything is possible.
Or she'd say that I might be scared now but to not let that stop me, because-- because every problem has a solution.
And everything's been so crazy, we've barely been able to spend time together.
And I am not letting the world end before we go on a real date!
I know!
I can't believe I just did that.
Luz, I don't think my parents know what they're helping Belos accomplish.
Will you help me tell them about the draining spell?
Hooty, what's your status?
Good.
Clean up that mess.
Willow, have you gathered the supplies?
Excellent!
Aw, Ghost, did you help too?
Who's a good palisman?
Great, now all we need is-
That's great!
Wait, Eda's still here?
Eda, you're supposed to be helping Hooty build our defenses!
Huh?
Uh, this looks ancient.
Yes, you're old, who cares?
We have a crisis on our hands!
Does this seem fine to you?
But she's a human, we have no idea how it'll affect her!
I am not giving this back until you're better, okay?
Oh, uh, you got it!
I know.
But I was taught to see every situation as an opportunity.
And today, I'll show Luz that I am an awesome girlfriend!
I volunteer as well.
As Luz's girlfriend, I must-
Well we can't afford to mess this up.
Luz is counting on me!
I mean, us.
A coven scout!
The Golden Guard?
He is a lot scrawnier than I imagined.
Too bad, because I don't trust you.
They're not paying attention.
There is no us.
Now keep walking.
Watch it.
She's also blocking the path to Eclipse Lake.
Stop talking like we're a team!
You have no idea what you're talking - I was gonna say, you have no-
Stay back!
But what doesn't look good?
No, Luz wouldn't make that kind of threat.
I'm an awesome girlfriend.
We don't have time to play around.
We are getting that Titan blood!
But Eclipse Lake is farther ahead.
Ugh, fine!
So, where will you go now?
That jerk!
Guys, you're okay!
There it is!
Then why are you digging?
There's blood in the key?
Luz has been sending me these strange human codes.
I don't understand all of them but, this one seems pretty clear.
Come back with results or we're done.
U-R-RAD.
FOOLS-BLOOD-BAD.
U-OKAY?
COME-HOME?
Of course!
This is Luz we're talking about!
You know, you were right.
We do have a lot in common.
I grew up thinking everything was an opportunity to justify existing, but there are people out there who won't make you feel worthless, you just have to let yourself meet them.
Oh come on, being nice usually works for Luz!
Fine, just stay away from Luz.
Me too!
Actually we might be okay.
Yes, mom.
Wow it's so fast and strong.
Order now.
Oh no, it's undefeatable.
How will I ever escape?
Hey, Luz.
In celebration of your return, I've brought you a homemade fairy pie.
The ingredients are very fresh.
Right, sorry.
I'm sorry, I was a coward in there.
No, no, Luz, you don't have to do that.
I... I can't.
I have to go.
Mom?
I'm ready for the show tonight!
We found a replacement?
Did anyone come to the house today?
Luz needs our help!
That'll take too long.
We should just rush the guards at the door!
We should just bust our way through!
We have to help Luz now!
You're helping?
STAY AWAY FROM MY LUZ!
Huh-uh!
Luz, are you okay?
No, you're gonna listen to me for once.
Luz, Gus and Willow are my friends!
They're nice to each other, they listen to each other.
They make me think about the kind of person I really WANT TO BE!
Let my friends back into Hexside, or else your precious investors will watch me rip this thing apart bit.
Bit.
I heard he’s scarred from wild magic.
Hola, batata.
Yes!
Is that… not a term of endearment?
I’m still figuring out this human language book from Gus.
Uh, so… Did that Titan Blood ever come in handy?
Uh, hey, Willow.
It’s, uh, been a wile since I came here on my own.
So, Luz has been acting super weird, and I think she’s lying about her trip to the Human Realm, and she left her phoon, uh, phun?
Ugh her thingy at school, and
Luz says she hasn’t been to the Human Realm, but I just get the feeling that she’s lying.
And I can find out the truth by watching this!
But I’m not gonna invade her privacy like that.
Would you?
Willow.
Okay.
But I am a little rusty.
I’m glad we can be like this again.
Book 5, chapter 8, Azura pretends to kidnap Hecate
Yes, but right now I just want to keep my girlfriend from being sent to the Conformatorium… again.
She could have been lying.
Maybe… you can tell me about this.
Don’t worry.
I haven’t watched it.
But… you did finish the portal door.
You did see your mom.
And it looks like it didn’t go well.
I know this situation is crazy, and I’m okay taking things one day at a time.
But, I can’t help if I don’t know what’s going on.
Tell me what happened.
Is… Belos planning something?
And why did he say he’s going to meet you again?
Didn’t you already meet him?
What else don’t I know?
What’s gonna happen?
Luz?
Where are we?
I think Hooty brought me here?
Yeah heh… house demons get like that, after a couple thousand years.
It’s fine.
Listen.
About what happened, at… my place.
I kinda… if we could just forget about the whole thing?
Maybe?
What is this?
Did you- um- did you just say something?
Yeah… it kinda was.
I’ll… get out of your hair.
Yeah, this was stupid.
I mean, us?
Dating?
Heh.
That’s stupid, right?
What’s going on?
I’m all right.
I’m not as cool as you think.
Do you wanna go out with me?
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, you can say it.
I don’t know.
These are the last messages I got from Luz.
She must've typed them quickly, because all I could decipher was, Learned a lot of bad stuff, something, something, Day of Unity, something, something and, Don't scare 'em away?
I don't know what any of it means.
Those are for me.
It's okay, Willow.
They're tough.
Not everyone can stand up to them.
Of course, yes.
Smart move.
Whoa, what?
How did we get here?
I just got a text from Ed.
He, Bump and a bunch of others are in the Healing Homeroom.
We should find our way over.
Willow, watch out!
Lucky shot, Willow.
No, I got this!
I just got you back as a friend.
Let me protect you!
That won't be a problem.
Willow can bust through anything.
Nice one!
What's going on?
I really have to talk to my parents about this.
I can't believe you took down a coven head.
Yeah.
This is just a nasty one.
Ugh.
It's back already!
You didn't touch it, right?
Dad filled this thing with alarms.
Dad?
How did you find us?
Luz, did you lie to me earlier?
Well, I am worried!
You've been acting weird all day and now I'm in trouble!
What is going on with you?
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Either of you.
I've always wanted to enter this Brawl.
I thought it would be fun to bring home the belt.
And I thought I could understand my dad better.
But then you joined the competition.
And then you tried to mess with that Abomaton on your own.
And then you lied about it.
You've been acting strange all day.
Does it have something to do with the Human Realm?
I don't know what rituals you have in the Human Realm, but, I'll help you pick some flowers, and we can do something here!
Dad!
I got your back!
What?
Oh, he just doesn't get it!
Are you guys doing okay?
I'm making my own choices from now on.
You're welcome.
No, that's always been Mom's dream.
And you just went along with it.
I bet you didn't even know I was dating Luz!
See?
You don't talk to us anymore!
You're too busy making these monsters for the Emperor, and Mom's been too busy trying to dye my hair green.
Finally someone gets it.
Can you tell Mom that?
It's a start.
Find any good ones?
Let me try.
Ugh.
How do you get it to do what you want?
Do you think they'll reach the Human Realm?
Come on.
Give it back.
If you give me back my hairband, I'll read you whatever book you want tomorrow.
Are they bothering you again?
And this might tell you how to travel between realms, right?
Well, something this old would be kept in the Forbidden Stacks.
Only Malphas, the master librarian, is allowed in here.
Hey, wait.
I never said I wasn't gonna help.
My staff card should be able to open those doors.
But once we're inside, you have to listen to everything I say.
If we're caught, I could lose my job.
Well, let's not waste any time.
Actually, we're here.
Malphas is actually the one who gave me my job and my own study room.
He's usually nice, but if we're caught, he'd feed us to the book worms.
Huh.
The human world sounds odd.
We're getting that diary.
Not right now, Luz.
Everything's changed since you came here.
Being around you, it makes me do stupid things and I wish it didn't.
I think I need to go home.
Ever since Luz came here, things have just gotten confusing.
I'm thinking things I've never thought before.
I'm feeling things I never used to feel!
So, how's it look?
Oh yeah.
Mom always liked it green.
I thought I could use a change...
u-uh, how'd you get this back?
And, what happened?
Oh, looks like you made a new friend.
Wait, This is an echo mouse.
It consumes knowledge through writing and can play back anything it eats.
We dealt with them a lot at work.
Watch.
Don't worry, you always have a way of sneaking into people's hearts.
Uh, okay, good to see you!
Farewell forever.
Why did I do that?
Why'd I do that?
Why did I do that?
