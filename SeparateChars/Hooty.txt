Hoot-hoot!
Password, please!
All right, all right!
Geez!
You never want to have any fun!
Hoot!
It's my birthday!
And I love you, Luz!
It's your faithful pal Hooty reporting for duty!
Up at dawn, taking orders all day long!
Hmmmm, no thanks!
Sorry.
You said I was desperate, so now I'm playing hard to get.
I don't know.
What are you offering?
Wow, this is incredible!
It's so real!
You got yourself a deal!
Hooooot!
Sir, the honor is all mine.
You'll never understand what we've been through together!
I will be haunted by my actions forever.
Hoot hoot!
Hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot...
Sleepwalking... sleepwalking... Sleep-hooting!
Hiya, Lilith!
Peek-a-hoot!
Sorry!
Eda doesn't like trespassers, but I'm always here to make new friends!
Hoot!
Look at me!
I'm a person now.
Wobbly, wobbly!
Ooh, blackout!
Hoot hoot!
Hoot hoot!
Bye, friend!
I feel like dancing!
Hoot!
I did it!
Oh hey!
Look, it's a bug!
Aww!
Just an old leaf!
Well, that's good too.
The roughhousing was fun, but I like this part of our playdates even better!
I spy with my little eye something coming this way!
Oh Luz, there you are!
Hoot hoot, Luz!
Time to fill up that darling little head of yours with... delicious knowledge!
HOOT HOOT!
Oh, Luz!
You have a gueeessssstttt!
You wanna hear my worst nightmare?
Hooty-hoot!
Hoot, hoot!
Hoot hoot!
I don't need a babysitter.
I'm a big boy house!
Company! Hooray!
Finally someone to listen to my stories!
By the power of moonlight, I have risen.
Hoot hoot.
If you want this to end as you say, three must hold hands.
It's the only way.
Hey, I'm a refined taste.
Hoot!
Hoot!
Is the room spinning or is it just me?
Just a little house humor.
Ooh. It's okay.
I'm just glad I was included.
I heard her tiny mouse feet walking close by.
Or that might've been some mice.
Anyway, someone started moving in that direction.
Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo.
Look at the weather vane!
Ding-dong. Ding.
Hoot!
Hoot!
Ding dong!
Hey, you wanna hear about my night?
Hoot House.
Hooty Hooting.
Oh, wow.
I've been waiting for someone to call all day, and now, it's finally happened!
We can talk for hours, and hours, and hours, and hours...
Guys?
Today's my monthly cleaning.
Hoot, hoot.
I'm 20% mucus, but don't let that stop you.
C'mon, I have so many hard-to-reach spots that need swabbing!
Hey!
Guess what's been in my mouth that I'm about to throw up!
The mail!
An adventure with friends!
I'll go pack my stuff!
Good news, I'm bringing my knapsack full of games!
Hello?
Oh, a fly!
Talk to me, talk to me!
Boy, fly, we sure get into some wacky hijinks, don't we?
Sure feel sorry for anyone that missed seeing us two rabble-rousers getting into scrapes.
Good thing I brought a camera.
Yep.
Hooty and fly.
Together forever.
You and me.
Now I know what friendship taste like.
Yum. Taste like a bug.
Sweet moves, little dude.
I forget I'm here too.
Boop.
I chew insects.
I turn them into mush.
My beef is insects.
They're what I eat.
All I know is, you taught me and I turned out just fine.
Hoot!
Well, hurry it up with that force field.
That rain is getting closer to my precious stucco.
'Cause she coughs up rat bones.
No, let her try.
It'll be funny.
Hoot!
Hoot!
Hoot, oh, hoot!
Hey, hey!
Is anyone there?
Hello?
Hoot?
I'm on the floor.
It's cold!
Finally, I get to be a part of something.
Maybe I can help!
I'm pretty good at getting stuck inside people's heads!
I'm the secret!
Hoot?
I've been waiting to hear those words all my life!
Where to begin?
It all started with a hunt.
Blood red skies.
My first word was hoot.
My second word was hoot-hoot.
Here's a song I wrote!
Bored bored bored, bored bored bored.
Here a hoot, there a hoot, somewhere else a hoot hoot, hooty-hoot hoot!
Hoot-hoot!
Guess who found a special friend in the forest.
It was me.
Hoot!
Hooty!
Okay!
You gals ready to hoot?
We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed.
Hoot!
I’m an unbiased participant, hoot-hoot.
Time for one more play.
It’s me again!
Oh geez, hey!
I’ll be waiting too!
Hoot-hooty-hoot!
Hi, Luz!
I'm just wishing you a good morning.
Geez!
Hoot!
Have a nice trip.
Hoot, hoot.
If you want the answer that you seek, solve my riddle within a week...
Okay, okay.
She went into the forest towards Bonesborough.
Sheesh!
