Hoot-hoot!
Password, please!
All right, all right!
Geez!
You never want to have any fun!
Hoot!
It's my birthday!
And I love you, Luz!
It's your faithful pal Hooty reporting for duty!
Up at dawn, taking orders all day long!
Hmmmm, no thanks!
Sorry.
You said I was desperate, so now I'm playing hard to get.
I don't know.
What are you offering?
Wow, this is incredible!
It's so real!
You got yourself a deal!
Hooooot!
Sir, the honor is all mine.
You'll never understand what we've been through together!
I will be haunted by my actions forever.
Hoot hoot!
Hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot...
Sleepwalking... sleepwalking... Sleep-hooting!
Hiya, Lilith!
Peek-a-hoot!
Sorry!
Eda doesn't like trespassers, but I'm always here to make new friends!
Hoot!
Look at me!
I'm a person now.
Wobbly, wobbly!
Ooh, blackout!
Hoot hoot!
Hoot hoot!
Bye, friend!
I feel like dancing!
Hoot!
I did it!
Oh hey!
Look, it's a bug!
Aww!
Just an old leaf!
Well, that's good too.
The roughhousing was fun, but I like this part of our playdates even better!
I spy with my little eye something coming this way!
Oh Luz, there you are!
Hoot hoot, Luz!
Time to fill up that darling little head of yours with... delicious knowledge!
HOOT HOOT!
Oh, Luz!
You have a gueeessssstttt!
You wanna hear my worst nightmare?
Hooty-hoot!
Hoot, hoot!
Hoot hoot!
I don't need a babysitter.
I'm a big boy house!
Company! Hooray!
Finally someone to listen to my stories!
By the power of moonlight, I have risen.
Hoot hoot.
If you want this to end as you say, three must hold hands.
It's the only way.
Hey, I'm a refined taste.
Hoot!
Hoot!
Is the room spinning or is it just me?
Just a little house humor.
Ooh. It's okay.
I'm just glad I was included.
I heard her tiny mouse feet walking close by.
Or that might've been some mice.
Anyway, someone started moving in that direction.
Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo.
Look at the weather vane!
Ding-dong. Ding.
Hoot!
Hoot!
Ding dong!
Hey, you wanna hear about my night?
Hoot House.
Hooty Hooting.
Oh, wow.
I've been waiting for someone to call all day, and now, it's finally happened!
We can talk for hours, and hours, and hours, and hours...
Guys?
Today's my monthly cleaning.
Hoot, hoot.
I'm 20% mucus, but don't let that stop you.
C'mon, I have so many hard-to-reach spots that need swabbing!
Hey!
Guess what's been in my mouth that I'm about to throw up!
The mail!
An adventure with friends!
I'll go pack my stuff!
Good news, I'm bringing my knapsack full of games!
Hello?
Oh, a fly!
Talk to me, talk to me!
Boy, fly, we sure get into some wacky hijinks, don't we?
Sure feel sorry for anyone that missed seeing us two rabble-rousers getting into scrapes.
Good thing I brought a camera.
Yep.
Hooty and fly.
Together forever.
You and me.
Now I know what friendship taste like.
Yum. Taste like a bug.
Sweet moves, little dude.
I forget I'm here too.
Boop.
I chew insects.
I turn them into mush.
My beef is insects.
They're what I eat.
All I know is, you taught me and I turned out just fine.
Hoot!
Well, hurry it up with that force field.
That rain is getting closer to my precious stucco.
'Cause she coughs up rat bones.
No, let her try.
It'll be funny.
Hoot!
Hoot!
Hoot, oh, hoot!
Hey, hey!
Is anyone there?
Hello?
Hoot?
I'm on the floor.
It's cold!
Finally, I get to be a part of something.
Maybe I can help!
I'm pretty good at getting stuck inside people's heads!
I'm the secret!
Hoot?
I've been waiting to hear those words all my life!
Where to begin?
It all started with a hunt.
Blood red skies.
My first word was hoot.
My second word was hoot-hoot.
Here's a song I wrote!
Bored bored bored, bored bored bored.
Here a hoot, there a hoot, somewhere else a hoot hoot, hooty-hoot hoot!
Hoot-hoot!
Guess who found a special friend in the forest.
It was me.
Hoot!
Hooty!
Okay!
You gals ready to hoot?
We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed.
Hoot!
I'm an unbiased participant, hoot-hoot.
Time for one more play.
It's me again!
Oh geez, hey!
I'll be waiting too!
Hoot-hooty-hoot!
Hi, Luz!
I'm just wishing you a good morning.
Geez!
Hoot!
Have a nice trip.
Hoot, hoot.
If you want the answer that you seek, solve my riddle within a week...
Okay, okay.
She went into the forest towards Bonesborough.
Sheesh!
YUP!
One bite will put you to sleep for hours!
For hours!
For hours!
This is just a trick to get me to wear clothes, well it won't work!
A fresh cup of tea for my favorite cup of tea.
That's you, Lulu.
I'm done for, Lulu.
Ah, to die in your arms.
Avenge me.
What happened to your crown of power?
Nice one, Lulu!
Up top!
Yeah!
I'm a house of principles!
You're asking me to lie?
Hootrageous!
What's wrong, Luz?
I-I'll get ready!
Porta-Hooty, reporting for Hooty!
Are we still flying?
It's been hours.
My pleasure.
I've seen better graffiti.
I've got better graffiti on me.
Are you seein' what I'm seein'?
Wh-what does that mean?
Your Majesty!
It's me, faithful ol' Hooty.
You know I was messin' around with you the whole time, right?
More running, less stopping!
Is this what regret feels like?
I HATE IT!
They're in place!
Yeeeees!
The perimeter's secured.
Nothing's getting past me!
Well, I've never heard of underground Korean hip-hop before!
Fear not, maiden!
Hooty, the guardian owl of Ga'Hoot, has protected you once more!
Ga'HOOOOT!
You've always got Uncle Hooty's shoulder to lean on!
Lean on me!
Let me be your emotional support!
Hooty-hoot!
We have visitors!
Lulu!
Oh, here it comes!
I would protect these silly children with my life!
Does anyone feel that marching around the edge of the forest?
Wait for me!
Is that a finger?
It's a long way from our Titan.
Maybe we're a bunch of early birds.
Luz, are you okay?
Where's your other arm?
That doesn't look like the Boiling Isles to me.
Are we really leaving him alone?
Yeah, that dude is straight up evil.
Luz!
Follow me!
Oh, hey!
Thought I'd get Lulu some souvenirs.
THEN RUN FASTER!
Hey!
Luz just saved your life!
Tell Lulu how brave I was!
Are Titans even evil?
Hoooooot!
It is so nice to be surrounded by all of Lulu's dearest friends!
We're here to celebrate the new assistant curator of the Supernatural Museum of History.
Here's to you, Lulu!
Yes, but not the app-pellet-tizers.
You want a- There's an extra one.
I'm working on it.
Hiya, Eda!
Your pops is such a nice guy.
Say, how did he get that scar on his-
Toot toot!
The Hexside train is a-coming!
Chugga-chugga!
Hootly-mootly!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ummm!
Whoahahaha!
I bet even Eda couldn't do that!
Wow!
Hoooot!
Keep the change!
Witch, this is peak of Mount Romance.
I've been around!
We're gonna have to be sneaky.
It's me!
Your good buddy Belos!
Worship me!
Not the first time I've heard that!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoot!
Law is meaningless!
Stealing is legal now!
I am your god!
Oh, hey, your buddy's trapped too, right?
The angry blond kid?
Eda's smart but without magic, I'm afraid she can't do much.
Inopportune interruption, eh?
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
Special delivery from a secret admirer!
Heh, that's, uh, that's an awful lot of ice cream you guys are eating.
You know Eda gets that stuff from the Night Market, right?
Isn't that taking it a bit too far?
Lulu, you can't!
BUT I CAN'T HOLD A PEEEEEN!
Dearest Lulu, I hope this letter finds you well, and that you're enjoying your time with your parents.
I'm writing to let you know, that I am a genius!
Whenst I wrote you last, I was in the throes of a malaise.
That's when I got your letter!
How we doin', Hoot House?
Sounds like our little demon is becoming a deMAN!
Ha ha ha!
Those teens, eh?
Their moods change like the wind.
But every time you overwork yourself, you turn into the Owl Beast!
You were right, Lulu.
These three needed my help.
So I devised the plan of plans.
Your words inspired me to help everyone, Lulu.
So I'll start with King!
Our little bundle of joy was growing up, and he had questions.
As the only other demon in the house, I had answers!
But would he accept help from me?
Never!
Unless
Are you angry?
Sweaty?
Is there hair in places?
Does your voice crack in a super embarrassing way?
I have the answers you seek!
You're going through demon puberty!
This isn't a health class!
It's an unholy test, to determine what kind of demon you are!
Yup!
Besides, I'm pretty sure I'm the only other demon here, so ha ha, what other choice do you have?
YAAAAY!
Our ancestors arose from the muck of a decomposing titan.
And there are so many of us!
But all demons can be placed in three categories; bug, biped, and beast!
DO NOT INTERRUPT!
Now I'm pretty sure you're not a bug, but we can't rule anything out.
As a type of worm myself-
I'm an expert on this subject!
LET'S BEGIN!
Bug types naturally communicate through dance, like so!
Poetic!
DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER!
Well, your dance was offensive, and your attempt to spin a cocoon was just... Sad.
Honestly.
Okay!
Let's see if you're a biped demon!
They walk on two legs and even have bile sacs, just like witches!
So for this test, you're gonna have a duel with a little friend of mine.
Wow!
Heh, not a single spell!
Even bug demons have some magic.
Okay, okay.
There's only one way to test for beast types.
I'm gonna need a blood sample.
After reviewing the results, we've come to a conclusion.
Are you!
The blood tests were inconclusive; We don't really know what you are!
But that's okay!
Cause we don't need to know that to be your friends!
The only real answer is inside your heart!
I didn't want to make you mad.
Oh no.
Now I'm sad, too.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CRUMBLE!
Things got a little, uh, messy with King.
But I wasn't about to give up!
What Eda said confused me; how could she get stronger, if she's bone-tired?
And maybe I was being a Nervous Nellie, but I couldn't shake my fear of the Owl Beast coming out.
YUP!
One bite will put you to sleep for hours!
I made it worse.
I MADE IT WORSE!
Luz's heart was torn between finding a way home, and the pursuit of love.
How do I know all that?
I suppose I'm just attuned to other people's emotions.
She wasn't going to make any progress if her attention was split.
NOOOO!
I DID IT AGAIN!
I CAN'T HELP ANYONE!
OUT!
OUT, VILE OWL!
RID THIS HOUSE OF THYSELF!
NEVER SHALL I CURSE THIS HOME WITH MY ODIOUS PRESENCE AGAIN!
Looks like I have to do this... the hard way.
I FAILED YOU ALL!
I FAILED YOU ALL!
BUT I STILL FAILED LUZ!
King may not know where he came from, but he's learning more and more about himself every day!
Eda can become Harpy Eda now!
She still drinks her elixir, but she's accepted the Owl Beast as part of her.
IT'S PROGRESS!
And Luz's new GF showed her tips and tricks to get more information from that old human's diary.
They're adorable, and deserve all the happiness!
I had to promise never to help anyone ever again, but nevertheless, I'm a genius!
Everything solved!
No more mysteries!
OH MY GOSH, A BUG!
Ahhhh.
Whoopsie!
Hope that was junk mail!
Hey, look!
Everyone missed us so much they put up pretty signs!
Hey, Lulu!
Lulu!
I got you a shirt!
Maybe he wants to be treated like, I don't know, normal?
Uh, Lulu, I think we have a bigger problem.
He's tricking you!
Attack plan activated!
New roomie check-in!
How's my bestie doing?
A scrying potion!
Lulu, you're trying to spy on your old buddies?
I can help!
We can find out their crushes.
We can give them cute couple names!
A good friend would respect her wishes, but a better friend would help no matter what!
Without friends?
You don't know how to get those firebees, but I can help.
Sorry, Lulu.
I mean, sorry, Lilith.
I'm here for you, Lulu.
No witch is an island.
Now face my wrath!
It's okay.
I'm sorry for being all nosy-nosy.
But hey, Lulu, every friendship comes with its ups and downs.
Right, best friend?
Hoooooot!
I can't wait to share parenting tips!
