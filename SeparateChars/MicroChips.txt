Is it just me or did things take a turn towards Weirdsville?
100 percent!
I was thinking we could paint a model of DNA.
It shows that we're smart but invites them in with the very fiber of our being.
[gasps]
What did you do?
Hey, you did that on purpose!
[gasps]
My friendship algorithm!
Well, you guys painted all over my molecular structures!
We're really?
With song.
Surely, brains, not brawns, are the secret formula for backstage success.
While simple machines do provide a mechanical advantage, by multiplying force against a single load ?
the set ?
I'm afraid the net loss of force due to friction in the opposite vector has not been overcome.
Your face is nothing more than a genetically predetermined arrangement of stratified squamous epithelial cells.
I won't be moving anything.
This muscle is gonna convince those muscles to move it on their own.
Muscle, muscle, muscle!
Isn't it obvious?
I fabricated a counterfactual peer review to pseudo-scientific study in Insane Lats magazine that postulates the only way to make your shirt uncomfortably tight for the summer is battle ropes.

Aah!
Will you accept a half-chewed carrot stick?
I erased a ton of memory just this morning.
Four terabytes of quantel-accelerflex memory to be precise.
How come no one's ever impressed by that?
Apples!
Caramel apples over here!
We've got red and green and everything in between!
Caramel apple?
Vignette said she wanted cool nerd chic.
I'd say she found it.
Wouldn't you?
[grunting]
[clears throat]
Do you by any chance have a knife or samurai sword or several tiny but very sharp nail clippers?
I was just minding my own business making perfect caramel apples, when suddenly, Vignette saw me and said I wasn't as cool a nerd as she thought.
Then she took my picture, and I ended up here, violating all known laws of space and time.
