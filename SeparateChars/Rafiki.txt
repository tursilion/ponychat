Hmmm... heh heh heh...
Simba.
Simba?
He's alive?
Hehe.. He's Alive!
It is time!
Can't cut it out.
It'll grow right back!
The question is: Who... are you?
Well I know who you are.
Shh. Come here. 
It's a secret.
It means you're a baboon, and I'm not.
Wrong.
I'm not the one who's confused.
You don't even know Who you are.
Sure do!
You're Mufasa's boy!
Correction: I know your father.
Nope.
Wrong again!
Haha hah hah!
He's alive!
and I'll show him to you.
You follow old Rafiki; he knows the way.
Come on.
Don't dawdle!
Hurry up!
C'mon.
Come on!
STOP!
Look harder.
What was that?
The weather.
Pbbb.
Very peculiar... don't you think?
Ahhh.
Change is good.
It doesn't matter; it's in the past.
Oh yes.
The past can hurt.
But the way I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it.
No no no no.
It's not a stick!
Good!
Go on!
Get out of here!
Ho ho ho ho.
You won't find him here.
Haha.
The king... has returned.
It is time.
It is a girl.
Asante sana
Oh, Mufasa... every day Kiara grows more beautiful, into a Queen that will someday make us all very proud.
This cub Kovu... Zira fills his heart with hate.
I am very worried, Mufasa.
Things are not going well.
Hmm?
You have a plan?
What?
Kovu... Kiara... together?
This is the plan?
Are you crazy?
This will never work!
Oh, Mufasa, you been up there too long.
Your head is in the clouds!
Okay, okay, okay!
Okay!
All right -- okay!
I don't think this is going to work... but I trust you.
I just hope you know what you are doing!
Kiara.
You!
How dare you save the King's daughter?
And where are you going?
That's what you think!
Come on!
You follow old Rafiki; he knows the way!
You follow -- you'll see!
Hurry now!
To a special place in your heart... called Upendi!
There's a place where the crazy moon makes the monkeys sing and the baboons swoon.
Where the sultry scent of the lotus bloom will carry you away!
Where the hippos swing from the jungle vines and the rhino rhumba in a conga line!
And the pink flamingos are intertwined as the stars come out to play!
In Upendi where the passionfruit grows sweet!
And it's so divine that you lose your mind as it sweeps you off your feet!
In Upendi without a worry or a care!
It just takes two to make it through, your heart will lead you there.
You better watch your step cause the path is steep.
Better hold you rbreath cause the water's deep.
It's a long way down off of Lovers' Leap, but falling's half the fun!
In Upendi where the passionfruit grows sweet!
And it's so divine that you lose your mind as it sweeps you off your feet!
In Upendi without a worry or a care!
It just takes two to make it through, your heart will lead you there.
You can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow from Tanganyike to Kilimanjaro!
But you'll find Upendi whereever you are, underneath the sun!
Welcome to Upendi!
Oohh...
That depends on what you seek.
Oh, the better question is, where are you going?
I didn't have the pleasure.
Whoo!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Life without worry.
You seek Hakuna Matata.
Hakuna Matata, it means No Worries.
To find it, you must look beyond what you see.
It means, look beyond what you see!
Oh ho ho ho ho.
It means No worries.
So, I told the boy: To find Hakuna Matata, you must look beyond what you see.
Well, actually, it's not a meta...
Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
ha ha!
My work here is done.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Any story worth telling is worth telling twice.
