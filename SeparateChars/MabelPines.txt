It's getting closer!
Look out!
This attic is amazing.
Check out all my splinters!
Hey, friend.
Yes, you can keep chewing on my sweater.
Yay!
Grass!
He's looking at it!
He's looking at it!
I rigged it!
What?
Come on, Dipper!
This is our first summer away from home!
It's my big chance to have an epic summer romance!
My name is Mabel, but you can call me The girl of your dreams.
I'm joking!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh my gosh, you like turtles?
I like turtles too!
What is happening here?
Take me with you...
Mock all you want, brother, but I got a good feeling about this summer.
I wouldn't be surprised if the man of my dreams walked through that door right now.
Aww!
Why!
Not it!
What'cha readin', some nerd thing?
Uh, uh, it's nothing!
What?
Are you actually not gonna show me?
Whoa!
Shut.
Well, time to spill the beans.
Boop.
Beans.
This girl's got a date!
Woot woot!
What can I say?
I guess I'm just IRRESISTIBLLLLE!
Coming!
Hey, family!
Say hello to my new boyfriend!
We met at the cemetery.
He's really deep.
Little muscle there.
That's, what a surprise...
He means Norman.
I love jam!
Look.
This!
Oh, oh, my goodness.
Don't wait up!
I like you.
Daisies?
You scallywag...
Isn't he the best?
Check out this giant smooch mark he gave me!
Ha, ha!
Gullible.
It was just an accident with the leaf blower!
Kissing practice!
AHHH!
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
That was fun.
You think he might be a vampire?
That would be so awesome!
A zombie?
That is not funny, Dipper.
Maybe he's blinking when you're blinking.
Well, what about me, huh?
Why can't you trust me?
Beep bop!
Dipper, listen to me.
Norman and I are going on a date at five o'clock, and I'm gonna be ADORABLE, and he's gonna be DREAMY, and I am not gonna let you ruin it with one of your crazy CONSPIRACIES!
Coming!
Hey, Norman.
How do I look?
You always know what to say!
Finally, we're alone.
Oh, Norman, you can tell me anything!
Please be a vampire, please be a vampire!
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
You're really sweet, but, I'm a girl, and you're gnomes, and it's like, what?
Yikes, Let go of me!
Dipper!
Norman turned out to be a bunch of gnomes!
And they're total jerks!
Hair!
Hair!
Hair!
Aw, come on!
You guys are butt-faces!
Mmmm-MMMMM!
Hurry, before they come after us!
Move, MOVE!
It's getting closer!
I'll save you, Dipper!
Don't mention it.
Look out!
I gotta do it.
Trust me.
Dipper, just this once.
Trust me!
All right, Jeff.
I'll marry you.
You may now kiss the bride!
That's for lying to me!
THAT'S for breaking my heart!
And THIS is for messing with my brother!
Wanna do the honors?
Hey, Dipper?
I, um, I'm sorry for ignoring your advice.
You really were just looking out for me.
I guess I'm just sad that my first boyfriend turned out to be a bunch of gnomes.
Oh, you're just saying that!
Awkward sibling hug.
Really?
And I will have a, GRAPPLING HOOK!
Yes!
GRAPPLING HOOK!
I'm on it!
It works!
Grappling hook...
Are you ready for the ultimate challenge?
Then you know what this means!
Go, Sir Syrup!
Almost, almost, Yes!
I won!
Human-sized hamster balls?
I'm human-sized!
Nope, just memories.
And this beard hair.
Mazel tov!
The county jail was so cold.
Wow!
I feel like all my other senses are heightened.
I can see with my fingers!
Fishing?
I think he actually wants to fish with us.
There has to be a way out of this.
Awww, He's doing a happy jig!
Aww, donkey shpittle!
That's two fifties!
Not so high and mighty anymore!
Aha haha haha.
Hey, boys!
You can look, but ya can't touch.
Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak!
Dipper, I am one million percent on board with this!
We made the right choice!
We're gonna find that Gobblewonker!
Ah, bird!
So what's the plan?
Throw more cameras overboard or what?
What?
Why do you get to be captain?
What about Mabel, huh? Ma-bel! Ma-bel! Ma-bel! Ma-bel!
What about co-captain?
Aw, whoops.
As co-captain, I authorize that request.
Permission co-granted.
Hey!
How's it going?
It's going awesome!
Bow bow, buh bow bow!
Aw, I don't mind none!
Hey, look, I'm drinking water!
Twinkle, twinkle little, Look out!
Heh, heh.
But seriously, I'm on it.
See?
We're here!
I'm a lookout genius!
Hamster ball, here we come!
Soos, you rapscallion!
Hey!
Why aren't you laughing?
Are you scared?
Yeah, you are!
What was that?
Was it your stomach?
Wow.
So majestic.
Charlie! Why won't you interview me?
Me, too!
My name is Mabel! It rhymes with table! It also rhymes with, glabel! It also rhymes with, shmabel!
He did use the word scrapdoodle.
Dipper, Aah!
Look out!
Where do i go?
Might be?
It's stuck!
Didja get a good one?
WOO!
Hamster ball!
What's wrong?
Okay, yeah.
But why did you do it?
So, did you ever talk to your son about how you felt?
You still have one roll of film left.
But we realized, the only dinosaur we wanna hang out with is right here.
Five more bucks says you can't do it with your eyes closed, plus me singing at the top of my lungs!
Who wants to hear a joke?
Heh, heh!
Yeah, ya do!
Here it goes: why did the pelican get kicked out of the restaurant?
'Cuz he had a very big bill!
La la la la!
Yuk yuk yuk!
Blah blah bloo!
Yay!
Hurray!
That duck is a genius!
Are you saying you could outwit Duck-tective?
It was so sparkly...
Buried, Hey, I was gonna say that!
They're so life-like.
Cheer up, Grunkle Stan.
Where's that smile?
Beep, bop, boop!
Don't worry, Grunkle Stan.
I'll make you a new wax figure from all this old wax!
Grunkle Stan, I'm an arts and crafts master.
Why do you think I always have this glue gun stuck to my arm?
Eugh, eugh!
I don't know what that word means, but thank you!
Dipper!
What do you think of my wax figure idea?
She's part fairy princess, and part horse fairy princess!
Like a waffle, with big arms!
Oh, muse.
You work in mysterious ways.
I think, it needs more glitter.
What do you think?
It's Mabel.
Thank you for coming!
I made this sculpture with my own two hands!
It's covered in my blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids!
Yeah.
I will now take questions!
You there!
Um, Yes!
Next question!
I think that went well.
Dipper, you wanna do a toothbrush race?
My expert handcrafting, besmirched. Besmiiiirrrched!
He's really good.
He figured out who was eating our tin cans!
Aww, you sneeze like a kitten!
Yeah!
Even us!
Hey, look!
A clue.
That's weird.
They've got a hole in them.
Wait a minute.
The lumberjack!
Furious enough, for murder!
Then that's where we're going.
Break in the case!
We have an axe!
We're here to interrogate Manly Dan the lumber jack for the murder of wax Stan.
Dedledle-e.
He's resting.
You got it, Dippingsauce.
Hey there, fellow restaurant patron!
Bap!
Your wife is gonna be beautiful.
Oh man, we are on fire today!
Pa-zow, Pa-zow, Pa-zow!
Of course, it all adds up!
It's so irrefutable.
You have the right to remain impressed with our awesome detective work.
Toby Determined, you're yesterday's news.
Huh?
What?
Could you repeat?
Dipper, we've come so far, we can't give up now.
All the wax guys have that.
It's where the pole thingy attaches to their stand dealy.
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!
Are you, magic?
You were right all along, Dipper!
Wax people are creepy!
What do we do, what do we do?
That's it!
We can melt them with hotty melty things!
Decorative candles!
It's worth a shot, I guess.
Dipper! Watch out!
Catch!
Y'know any limericks?
Dipper!
You're okay!
You solved the mystery after all.
No offense Dipper, but you're the sidekick.
Your wax figures turned out to be evil, so we fought them to the death!
Oh uh, I'm not so sure...
I am ninety-nine percent sure that I did!
Hmm. Hey Dipper, which do you think is better?
Sequins or llama hair?
Thanks Dipper!
What makes him so special?
Wow, I'm getting all curiousy inside!
Well, is he really psychic?
I think we just found our loop hole, literally!
Mwop mwop!
It's starting!
It's starting!
But he's so wittle!
It came true.
You're impressed!
How'd he do that?
Woo!
Yeah!
Oh, come on.
His dance moves were adorable!
And did you see his hair?
It was like, whoosh!
Yeah, yeah!
Check it out, Dipper!
I successfully bezazzled my face!
Blink!
I'm unappreciated in my time...
I'll get it!
It's wittle ol' you!
You mean this one?
That's totally me!
No one, Grunkle Stan!
Gideon!
Aha ha!
Makeovers.
Yahoo!
Hey Dipper.
What's goin' oooon?
I know, right?
I was hanging out with my new pal, Gideon.
He is one dapper little man.
Oh, leave him alone!
You never want to do girly stuff with me... you and Soos get to do boy stuff all the time!
Whoa, the view from your family's factory is nuts!
Good thing we both brought our
What?
You are being so nice to me right now, quit it!
From the where-now?
Look Gideon, I um, I like you a lot, but let's just be friends.
A play date?
A shopping date?
Ummm. Okay, then, I guess...
Are you sniffing my hair?
It's not a date-date, it's just, you know, I didn't want to hurt his feelings and so I figured I'd throw him a bone.
Yeah right.
I'm not that lovable.
Kaboom!
Yes!
Oh boy.
I can't believe they let us bring a horse in here!
I've never seen so many forks!
And water with bubbles in it?
Ooh lala, oui, oui!
...I have no idea what you're saying.
Yeah...
Whoa whoa, you said just one date, and this was it.
Oh, Gideon, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to say, I don't know, I have a lobster now.
BLAARRGG!
He asked me out again and I didn't know how to say no.
It's not that easy, Dipper!
And I do like Gideon, as a friend slash little sister, so I didn't want to hurt his feelings!
I just need to get things back to where they used to be.
You know, friends.
Hah, you know I thought dancing was gonna be the end of the evening, right?
I mean yes.
I mean I'm always happy to hang out with a friend, buddy, pal, chum, other word for friend...
I already said pal, uh, mate?
I mean, he's so nice, but..
I can't keep doing this.
But I can't break his heart.
I have no way out!
I don't know!
I was in the friend zone, and then before I knew what was happening, he pulled me into the romance zone.
It was like quick sand!
Chubby quicksand!
Mabel's not here.
She's in sweater town.
You will?
Oh, thank you thank you thank you!
How'd it go?
Was he mad?
Did he try to read your mind with his psychic powers?
I'm so glad everything's back to normal!
Your turn.
Wendy, I need some advice.
You've broken up with guys, right?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I thought everything was back to normal, but I still feel all gross.
Maybe letting Dipper do it for me was a mistake.
Gideon deserves an honest break up.
I know what I've gotta do.
Thanks for talking to me, Wendy.
Gideon!
We have to talk!
I'm sorry Gideon, but I can't be your marshmallow.
I needed to be honest and tell you that myself.
Hey, but we can still be makeover buddies, right?
Wouldn't you like that?
No, not really!
You were like, attacking my brother, what the heck?
Dipper!
Listen Gideon, it's over.
I will never, ever, date you.
Gideon.
He'll never guess what number I'm thinking of.
Negative eight!
No one would guess a negative number.
Not yet.
Almost.
And, there.
I believe you're a big dork!
Ha ha ha!
Me first!
Uh, oh!
Somebody's in love!
Random dance party for no reason!
Yeah, you do!
Mom used to dress him up in a lamb costume and make him do...
The Lamby Dance!
Dipper would prance around and sing a song about grazing.
Since when are we thirteen?
Is this a leap year?
I knew it!
You love her!
Love love love love love!
Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.
I chewed my gum so it looks like a brain!
BLAH!
This is gonna blow someone's mind!
What, am I embarrassing you in front of your new GIRLFRIEND?
This town has such a colorful history!
WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP!
Go Dipper!
Punch that metal thing!
It's dust.
Jackpot!
Oh my Gosh!
Smile Dip!
I thought this stuff was banned in America!
Ugh, maybe I've had too much.
What do you think?
Of course you little angel!
The future! ...is in the past!
Onwards Aoshima!
Beleven.. teen...
WAAH!
Ohhh, Ugghh...
I'm never gonna eat or do anything ever again.
EVIL! OHHHHH...
What kind of sick joke is this?
Can we go to the diner?
We're huuungry.
But Grunkle Stan, I want pancakes!
Awww, Beating?
Oh, no offense Dipper, but you're not exactly Manly Mannington.
Ha ha ha!
You were listening to girly Icelandic pop sensation BABBA?
Put it away, put it away!
Come on, Grunkle Stan.
I'm sure deep down you have a soft side too.
What was that about?
Wait just a second.
I think I have an idea happening here.
You, And her, You have a thing for Lazy Susan!
You do have a soft side!
Grunkle Stan, you are a cranky, gross, weird old man.
But we will get Lazy Susan to like you because nothing is stronger than the power of Mabel.
To victory!
Okay, Grunkle Stan.
Welcome to the first day of whatever is left of your life!
First, a before picture.
I never miss a scrapbookertunity!
Deedly dum, memories.
Bleep.
Let's start out with some roleplaying.
Soos will play Lazy Susan.
Grunkle Stan, show me how you approach a woman.
Remember this is a safe, non-judgemental environment.
I'll just be right off the side judging you on a scale from one to ten.
This is gonna be harder than I thought.
Alright!
Let's try to get that inner beauty on the outside.
Smile harder.
Harder!
Perfect.
Soos!
Wha'd'you think?
This is going to take some really great training music.
Okay, Grunkle Stan.
You started like this.. But you became.. No, no, no!
Is that throw up on your shirt?
Grunkle Stan, come with me!
And leave your pants at home!
Lazy Susan.
Listen: I know he's not much to look at, but you're always fixing stuff in the diner, and if you like fixing stuff, nothing can use more fixing than my Grunkle Stan!
Also women live longer than men so your dating pool is smaller and you should really lower your standards.
EEEEEEEEEEEEE!
We did it!
When are you gonna call?
You wanna call now?
I don't have a phone.
Let's buy a phone!
We can put it on a credit card.
Let's get a credit card.
Dipper!
It's me, Mabel!
I'm looking at you through this glass!
Right here!
This is my voice!
I'm talking to you from inside!
Did you see me through the-?
What's wrong?
Wait a minute, do my eyes deceive me?
You have a chest hair!
Scrap-book ortunity!
Ohhh, Grunkle Stan, what did you feed us?
BBBBBLLLAAAA!
BBBBLLLAAAA!
Hahaha, barfing!
Comedy gold!
Oh boy, a trip to the copier store!
Butterflies!
Success!
Whoa!
Do you realize what this means?
BBBBLLLAAAA!
What?
But Grunkle Stan, this party is my chance to make new friends!
Uh, uh, I could work the counter with you, Wendy!
Let's kiss!
Plan?
Oh, you're not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you?
That sounds like a dumb idea for poopheads.
Dipper, you're the one getting in your way.
Why can't you just walk up and talk to her like a normal person?
Go, go!
Work it, work it!
Wow!
You've got an animal on your body!
I'm Mabel.
Why do have forks taped to your fingers?
I've found my people!
Who's that?
Hey, I'll compete!
I'm Mabel.
I'll take that as a compliment!
Nice meeting you!
She's going down.
It's not over 'til it's over, sisters!
Watch this.
Soos!
Give me the 80s-ist, crowd pleasing-ist, rock ballad-y-ist song you got!
Excellent.
Don't start UN-BELIEVING!
Hey goofus, now's your chance to ask Wendy to dance!
C'mon!
Pacifica, I just wanna say that whoever wins, it's been a super fun party.
Sorry I let you guys down.
I understand if you wanna leave.
The what?
Really?
You GUUYS!
Soos!
Play another song!
This thing's going all night!
This is it!
This is it!
Dipper!
Where have you been?
Meet my girlfriends!
Haha!
Nacho earrings.
I'm hilarious!
I've gotta good feeling about today.
Wow!
Look!
Candle dipping!
What chu talking 'bout?
Grunkle Stan, you coming?
Well hornswabber my haversack!
Audience participation!
That's water under the bridge.
Yeah!
Let's get this Pioneer Day started!
Right guys?
USA!
USA!
Hey, I can be serious!
I need some old-timey butterscotch.
Dipper, can I ask you something?
Do you think I'm silly?
I knew it!
The nacho earrings, the sweater.
I thought I was being charming, but I guess people see me as a big joke.
I did before Pacifica ruined it for me.
She ruins everything!
Nuh uh.
Really?
Wait!
I'm coming with you.
Conspiracies are serious, right?
Well, if I help you crack this code, then nobody could call me silly again!
I thought you hated that.
And solving a mystery will prove that I'm not silly.
I'm serious. Seeeeriousss...
It's so obvious!
Mwop!
I just made a hat.
Ugh, I just did something silly again.
This map should lead us to, The Gravity Falls Museum of History.
What are we gonna do next, steal Thomas Jefferson's rib cage?
I don't think the one with the bell can read...
Hey painting, be less stupid!
It worked!
I think I've seen that statue at the cemetery.
Oh, gross!
She's picking my nose!
Ha ha!
Ach.
Who's silly now, Pacifica?
Bam!
Ahh!
Okay.
Now we're getting into real conspiracy mode.
I feel serious.
Mmm.
Booby traps.
It's a treasure trove of historic-y, secret-y things.
Oh, man!
Ben Franklin secretly was a woman!
Once people see that I uncovered a historical conspiracy, they can never call me silly!
Who's Quentin Trembley?
And who is Quentin Trembley, anyway?
Aww, it's black and white?
Eighth-and-a-half?
Ugh, silly!
Are you going to kill us?
Anyone there?
Help help help!
I can't believe I left a trail of candy wrappers.
This is all my fault.
Pacifica had me pegged all along.
I'm just a silly failure, like that embarrassing president what's-his-name.
Peanut brittle really does have life-sustaining properties!
You're not silly, you're brilliant!
Oh, stop it.
It's a crate, Mr President.
Hmm.
How 'bout, that hole?
Trust, the silliness!
I'm legalizing everything!
A-greed!
Hey, Pacifica!
I uncovered a government conspiracy about the eighth-and-a-half president of the United States!
Who's silly now?
The eighth-and-a-half president of America.
How is he still alive?
Well, turns out you can hibernate in peanut brittle and it...
You know what, Dipper?
I've got nothing to prove.
I've learned to see silly as awesome!
Where do you think he's going?
You've been through so much.
I am a congressman.
You are officially pardoned.
No, I'm not, Grunkle Stan.
No, I'm not.
Mabel, away!
I'm okay!
Grunkle Stan, is that legal?
Look at you two!
Getting all romantic at the fair!
Yeah, it is!
When are you gonna learn, Dipper?
I'm always right about everything!
Hey, do you smell a gallon of body spray?
He is such a jerk.
I'll be there with you, brother.
Whatever happens, I'll be right here, supporting you every step of the–OH MY GOSH, A PIG!
He said Mabel!
Either that or doorbell.
Did you say Mabel or doorbell?
Ooooooooooohhhhh!
Pacifica!
Sir, I must have that pig!
Um, 15 pounds?
Everything is different now.
Look, Dipper!
I won my pet pig!
His name is Waddles.
I call 'im that because he waddles!
Waaaaaaaa-dddllleeessss!
What are you lookin' at?
Paging Dr Waddles, we got a boy here with a broken heart.
Haha!
Come on, man.
These are the jokes.
Nope!
I do everything right, all the time!
Wawawa!
And why are you bald?
What's that all about?
That's amazing!
Are you from the future or something?
This is a baby wipe.
I think he's just crazy.
So, who are you again?
Definitely, definitely.
Might we recommend one of the various attractions at the Mystery Fair?
Let's go get two dodos and force them to make out!
I'm coming, too!
I wanna relive the greatest moment in my life: winning Waddles.
See you earlier!
Ha yuk yuk yuk!
Do over!
15 POUNDS!
And yes, I am a witch!
Oo, maybe it's a time-curse.
Waddles, can you say time-curse?
Ooooooohhhhhhh!
Your face is so fat!
How hard could it be?
I love my pig!
Face it, Dipper, you're obviously fated to have a bad day at the fair, just like I'm fated to be with Waddles.
What's a variable?
Great!
I'm gonna go win my pig again.
But what about Waddles?
Anytime, broseph.
Now to win my pig.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
AAAAAAAAAA!
AAAAAAAAA!
I'm done.
We messed up the timeline!
Pacifica saw the flyer and won Waddles before I did!
She TOOK Waddles, Dipper!
It's okay.
We just need to go back and do things differently.
But if we don't go, I'll lose Waddles forever!
The real question is: when are we?
Oh wait, did you already
Alright.
Where are we?
The 70s?
Tallow?
What?
These are called braces.
Oh, said the guy who messed with the past all day and cost me my pig?
I'll mess with the past all I want!
Check it out!
A magic button machine!
Shoes that blink!
Hey, sister!
Guess who gets to vote in the future!
Ladies!
Up top!
That's called a high five!
Teach it to your friends!
This future seems neat!
I'm coming, waddles!
This thing is getting hotter!
HOT!
HOTHOTHOT!
I don't know!
Where are we?
AAAGH!
Wait, why does it smell so bad in here?
Look, we're back in the present!
Gimme that thing!
Dipper give it back!
But what about Waddles?
He was my soulmate!
I don't know, Waddles, Waddles, Dipper!
THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!
Hmmm!
He's saying thank you in Pig!
Aren't you, Waddles?
Guess he forgot to go back.
So I guess we never found out who was causing those time anomalies Blendin was looking for.
Ugh, my brain hurts.
I'm on it.
Uh, Soos?
King me!
Go Fish?
Try blinking to see if you can change the channel.
Should I sic Waddles on him again?
Whoa, easy tiger.
Boys!
Why can't you learn to hate each other in secret?
Like girls do!
Ugh, poor Dipper.
Hiding from Robbie, unable to face his fears.
You want me to go get a ladder?
Grunkle Stan, why you ackin' so cray-cray?
Why would Grunkle Stan be so weirded out by ladders?
Of course!
I think he has a secret fear of heights!
We'll have to test him to be sure!
Or we could leave well enough alone, Nah!
Alright, Waddles.
It's time to begin.
Operation Get Stan Over His Fear of Heights!
I came up with that name.
Happy Great Uncle's Day!
Ha ha, yeah of course it's not a day I made up.
What's wrong?
Are you saying these heels are TOO high?
Do they make you uncomfortable?
Hmm?
Admit it!
Admit you have a fear of heights!
How am I gonna get Grunkle Stan over his fear of heights?
Wow!
He's got a crazy voice!
Here, say these words.
Isn't that kinda like cheating?
Hey Grunkle Stan!
How would you like to go take a walk nowhere in particular while wearing a blindfold?
Grunkle Stan!
I would never!
Scout's honor!
Take off your blindfolds, now!
You're doing better than I thought!
Now let go of the handrail...
Hey, do you smell anger and hormones?
Hey, Robbie!
Get your own water tower!
What's happening!
We're safe, right?
I'm sorry, Grunkle Stan!
I thought this would help, but I was wrong!
So wrong!
It's a-me!
A-Mabel!
I'm gonna buy a talking horse!
Yeah, alright.
My favorite part's the theme song.
Little guy to black space nine!
They like it better in here.
Don't you babies?
What?
Boo!
Woah, don't you see what's happening, Dipper?
This millimeter is just the beginning.
I'm evolving into the superior sibling!
Bigger!
Stronger!
Alpha-twin!
Alpha-twin!
Y'know Dipper, I've always wanted a little brother.
Who knew I already had one?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Yeah!
I'm taller than Dipper!
Now Grunkle Stan, I hope you don't think little of him.
Dipper will forget.
He's got a 3, 2, 1, SHORT term memory!
POW! We are on FIRE!
I high-five hard.
I've been buying big clothes, I'll grow into them.
Wh-wh-what?
Yeah, mine happened first.
I'm gonna be taller in the end.
It's science, Dipper.
Alpha-twin!
Alpha-twin!
Give it up, Dipper!
What happened?
It doesn't make any sense.
Just a second ago you were, WAIT A MINUTE!
This is some kinda magicky thing.
Isn't it?
Was it a wizard or something?
There's a wizard in this closet, isn't there?
ISN'T THERE?
You're telling me that there is not a wizard in this closet.
You're telling me that if I open this door right now...
An invisible wizard!
REALLY, Dipper?
Does he only respond to incantations?
Excpecto wizzarium!
Lemme see that thing!
I'll be back for you later.
Normal hand karate chop!
Maybe he didn't see us use it and doesn't know it's a magic flashlight that can grow and shrink things.
What are you going to do with us?
We live in a democracy!
And never!
I will fight you until the day I, Gummy Koalas!
I know!
I will see you later.
Actually, I guess it's another mystery.
Cheekums, to freedom!
To freedom!
Oh, you're just a big old dummy-dum!
Yeah, especially you, 'cause you're short.
Oh flying discount dollar, if only you could fly us back to the Mystery Shack.
Wooh hooo!
To the Mystery Shack!
Leave that to Mabel.
I'm sorry, gummy friend.
Quick, get in front and I'll re-grow you.
Dipper!
That doesn't matter right now.
AWWW!
Why you acting so weird!
Why can't you just except that I'm a little bit taller than you?
Oh, what?
You mean like little-
I guess it's that, you're like better than me at like everything, and you always rub it in my face, Chess, checkers, ping pong.
I guess I finally felt like I was winning at something for once.
Don't you mean a little jerk?
We're cool.
You're cool, Soos.
Woah!
His hair's so shiny!
Grunkle Stan is doomed!
It's okay, you can go first if you want to.
Woah!
Hey, you let me keep my extra millimeter!
Awww!
Thanks!
Well I guess we should destroy this thing.
You know, so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands and junk.
Die, die!
Summerween?
Something about this feels unnatural.
You paid for the stuff, right?
I'm so excited!
And have the biggest stomachaches ever!
Haha, yeah!
Well, back at home, me and Dipper were kind of the kings of trick-or-treating.
Twins in costumes, the people eat it up.
The Summer-what-what?
This is all cheap-o loser candy!
Grunkle Stan, these are my best friends, Candy and Grenda.
I wish he could, but he has some very important meetings to attend!
File these documents under 'I', for I have a curly tail!
Oh man guys, just wait until you see Dipper's costume!
It's amazing!
Here he comes now!
What the hey-hey bro-bro, where's your costume?
Fight through it, man!
Where's your Summerween spirit?
Why'd you close the door?
I think a little trick-or-treating will make you feel better.
Dipper!
Where's your Summerween hospitality?
Well I am!
I apologize for my brother, he came down with a case of the grumpy-grumps.
Aww, what a cute little mask!
You're a funny guy, aren't you?
I do.
It means you have to come trick-or-treating!
Yay!
It's the legend Soos told us about.
It's true!
Listen up, people.
Now some might say that being cursed by a blood-thirsty holiday monster is a bad thing.
But that monster messed with the wrong crew.
With Candy's spirit, Grenda's strength, Dipper's brains, and...
Soos here, we'll get 500 pieces of candy and have fun doing it too, even if it takes all night!
To the streets!
Dipper, what's worse: getting eaten by a horrifying monster, or coming trick-or-treating with us?
Come on!
That sorta takes the fun out of trick-or-treat-or-die.
We've gotta up our game, Dipper.
You gotta put on your costume.
So what was that about being too sick to wear a costume?
Introducing, for the first time in public...
TADAH!
Peanut Butter and Jelly!
Yeah, I get it.
A hundred and twenty-four!
What a horrible mask!
We did it!
All we need is one more piece of candy.
And your cough went away too!
Last one to the last house is a pair of wax lips!
You're going to a party?
That's why you were acting so weird and trying to hurry us!
You're not sick at all!
So if it wasn't for this crazy monster, you were gonna ditch me!
On our favorite holiday!
What happened to the Dipper who used to love Halloween?
And where's all the candy?
What did you do!
Oh no!
All the jack-o-melons are out!
Ahhh!
Dipper!
It was the monster!
Uh, guys?
Oh, so now you're worried about the monster.
I thought all you cared about was Wendy.
That's exactly why we need to go trick-or-treating, Dipper!
We're getting older, there's not that many Halloweens left!
I guess I didn't realize it was already our last one.
Soos, don't you dare!
Oh thank goodness.
It was out of batteries.
Soos, no!
Loser candy!
I hate that stuff!
Hi, Grunkle Stan!
Aw, man.
We went to every single house, and we didn't even get to eat any candy!
But they taste just like chips!
Behold!
Mystery Shack bumper stickers!
You can stick 'em on your bumper, or over your husband's mouth.
Am I right, ladies?
She knows what I'm talking about!
Hey, it's on the house.
That's the Mabel difference!
Thanks for visiting!
Business!
Ching ching ching!
But, but, Grunkle Stan, whatever happened to please and thank you?
Hmm? Oh wait. Here they are!
Wop wop!
And you should be nicer to your employees, too!
I am going to write them such a letter!
That sounds amazing!
He said what?
Grunkle Stan, you've gone too far this time!
Did you seriously tell Soos not to follow his hopes and dreams because he couldn't handle it?
No way!
I bet you'd make way more money being nice then being a big grumpy grump to everyone all the time.
Yeah!
'Cause I give people respect!
And glittery stickers!
Then why don't you go on vacation?
Fine.
But if I win I get to be the boss for the rest of the summer!
Plus, you gotta sing an apology song with lyrics by me!
Mabel.
No, you got yourself a deal!
Deal...
Oh, come on.
Being a better boss than Stan will be a cinch.
Profit, here we come!
We'll get a new one.
Stan is no longer with us.
Whoa, Soos!
Stan's not dead!
He's on vacation for 3 days.
We made a bet.
Mabel's in charge now!
Uh huuuuuuh!
It's just one of the up-to-date managerial tricks I learned from this book I found propping up the kitchen table.
Because the real number one, is you!
Walk with me.
With me as boss you're gonna notice a few changes around here.
My job is to help you be your best SELVES.
Satisfied, Everyday, Loving Life, Very Much, Everyday, Satisfied.
Great listening ears so far!
Waddles, hold my calls!
Alright, people, now rap with me.
Wendy, how can I make your work space more Wendy-friendly?
Stan ain't here, sister!
Door's open!
And Soos, I believe this is yours.
As for you Dipper, 
Die, wolf costume, die! 
I want you to head into the woods, and don't come back until you found an amazing attraction!
Okay, guys!
It's time to prove that nice bosses finish first.
In the next forty-eight hours, we're gonna fill this jar with six hundred billion dollars!
Of course.
Waddles, run down to the shop and grab me a latte.
Whoa!
He's a hungry little guy.
Top marks!
Top marks!
Top marks!
Boss boss boss boss boss!
It's beautiful, Thank you!
Ha ha!
See you soon!
Tell 'em Mabel sent you!
Marvelous work, valued employee!
Who's that?
Is it Questiony the Question Mark?
Soos, don't give up.
Anything is possible when you, imaginize it!
Ssh. Ssshssssshshsshsssh.
Believe in yourself...
How's my favorite Wendy?
I'm so sorry.
Please, have a refund.
Wendy, you got a lot of cleaning up to do.
Pleeeaaase.
What?
I'm nothing like Stan!
In fact, take the rest of the day off?
Of course.
Mabel Pines, you are the best boss ever.
Thanks for shopping with us!
I'll get that!
Here you go.
Sorry.
Have a refund.
That's the Mabel difference...
I'm so tired.
I gave Wendy the day off so I had to do her job.
No way, that's what Stan would do!
I just need to think positive, be friendly, and everything will work out fine.
Well, He's an employee, sort of.
He was stressed out so I told him to take a soothing nature walk.
What do we do?
He's awarding himself stickers that he didn't even earn!
Ughh, why doesn't he just leave?
Our profits!
Stop, stop!
I wish we had an evil eye to show him!
Oh no!
Ahh, Dipper, it's the third day!
We've only got 7 hours to earn back our profits, or I've got to wear that loser shirt all summer!
Wendy, Soos!
Am I glad to see you.
We've got a lot of work to do but if we hurry, we can still beat Stan!
But-but, ENOUGH! I have HAD IT!
I fought a monster to save this business, and this is how you repay me?
I'm gonna get an ulcer from your lollygagging!
You shut your yaps!
I've been doing everyone's job while you bums have been bleeding me dry!
No buts except yours on the floor cleaning!
Now quit loafing and get to work!
That's yes, BOSS!
Dipper, what have I become?
We've got seven hours to turn this around!
Let's go, people!
Time is money, hard hat!
You got complaints, file them with the complaint department!
Ughh, my back.
Dipper, we've got tourists at 9 o'clock!
Figure something out, knucklehead!
We filled the whole jar!
One dollar.
Oh, no!
How much did you beat us by?
Please?
Grunkle Stan, I had no idea how hard it was being boss.
This place was cuckoo bananas until I started barking orders at people like you.
Actually, yeah, I think I have it in my notes here.
Grunkle Stan!
Do the kicks!
Jazzier!
What do you think?
Take thirty!
Goodbye, creepy love letters from Li'l Gideon!
Die!
Die!
Oh, it's just my personal box of mysterious secrets.
Nothing worth wondering about.
Goodbye forever!
Well, I guess we'll never know.
Grunkle Stan!
We're somewhere where it looks like we're nowhere.
Come on, Dipper, you can do better than that.
Hey!
Grunkle Stan.
Ever kissed a pig before?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Dipper.
Your voice is hillaaarrious!
Who are you?
What have you done with my brother!
Dipper!
I'll save you from this body switching warlock!
I know boys' voices change, but this is weird.
Weird and bad.
Mabel no like.
Dipper!
So, what did you do with the rest of that potion?
I spy with my little eye something that is...
Black!
Yay for Soos!
Hey guys, who wants to pass the time by spinning?
Everyone spin!
Nuts to the rules!
Tilt!
Tilt!
Tilt!
Oh, yeah.
What are you gonna do about it?
You're just a Pinball game, Pinball game.
Taunt, taunt.
Sweet Moses!
Boing!
Boing!
Boing!
Boing!
Multi-Ball!
My time has come.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Look at me and listen to what I'm doing!
BUZZZZZZ!
DISTRACTION!
DISTRACTION!
Soos, please!
Yes!
You did it!
You freed us!
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna tell a non-terrible story.
A story called Trooth Ache!
Aaaaawww.
They're hugging.
Grunkle Stan, how could you lie to those policemen?
Don't you know lying is always wrong?
Aaaaah!
Waddles, what am I gonna do about Grunkle Stan?
He needs to stop lying.
I know, but how do we stop him?
Maybe you should check Dipper's journal.
Oink Oink.
Say oink one more time.
Oink Oink.
Waddles, you genius!
Buried 'neath a trees stump in the deep forest are the truth teeth, which forces upon the wearer the inability to lie.
 Hmmm.
Quick question.
What happened to Dipper's spaghetti plate?
It's great!
Now he has to tell the truth.
Don't worry, Dipper.
The truth is always a good thing.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
But then he'll be a liar again.
Uh, sirs, I have to be completely and totally honest with you.
Our Great Uncle Stan is, is, Stan is.. secretly a crime fiction writer!
Yeah.
He was just telling you about a character in his upcoming page turner, Crime Grandpa!
He's never committed a crime in his life.
Also, have you lost weight?
Ha ha, writer, master of fiction.
Good night, officers.
I can't believed I lied.
Yeah, the greater good.
We have to find a place to get rid of these!
And I never saw that box full of magical teeth again.
Oh wait, there it is.
Where are we going?
Look!
The Shack!
Which means, we came right back out the top.
Maybe this is one story we should keep to ourselves.
He'll be fine.
Gravity Falls Pool?
He'll be fine.
Ah, the pool!
A sparkling oasis of summer enchantment!
Whoa, whoa!
Stop the presses!
Who's that?
Is it getting hot out here or is it just that guy?
Uh-uh.
Look at his little mustache hairs!
Aaah!
Oops, sorry.
Wow!
Oh my gosh, how crazy bumping into you even though we don't know each other!
That doesn't matter!
So, hey!
My name's Mabel.
Whoa!
Are you Australian?
You're so funny!
And your hair is beautiful, Mind if I...
This is it!
He likes you!
Go for it, Mabel!
It's time!
Ask him out on a date!
So, hey, you wanna go dry off?
Maybe hit the snack bar or...?
I'm upset.
Yet intrigued!
Hey there!
I brought you a sandwich.
It's sort of wet, but it's still good.
Blop.
I like sharing things.
Sandwiches, secrets.
Share your secret, beautiful stranger.
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought you were gonna say you had a girlfriend!
A merman, I should have known from your strange foreign fish language.
Your voice is so deep and masculine, how old are you?
So what's your name?
But I don't understand Mermando.
What's a guy like you doing in a public pool?
What?
I don't care that you're a merman.
You're, like, the coolest guy I've ever met.
And you can play at least one chord on the guitar.
Oh, yes, Mermando!
Yes!
Sure.
Where?
Wanna go for a walk?
Oh, right.
Then I'll be back tonight.
Look!
Here's a scrapbook of human stuff.
Here's me standing with my legs.
And here I am kicking Dipper in his legs.
He couldn't move his legs after that!
Can you imagine?
Not having legs?
And here's my whole family kick boxing!
What's wrong?
Mermando, why don't you just leave the pool?
This is it, Mabel.
First kiss moment, here we come!
Just go for it!
Nothing.
This?
I was eating some sour candy.
So my lips were doing that.
The candy was so sour.
Mermando, get ready!
I'm gonna bring the heat!
Mermando, are you okay?
Oh, it's your family, isn't it?
Are you thinking about them?
Mermando, enough is enough!
I care about you too much to see you like this.
We're ganna bust you out of here and get you back to your family.
We're breaking you out of here tonight!
Oops!
Sorry about that.
Water.
Okay, my original plan was to tape together a bunch fish sticks to make you a prosthetic pair of people legs.
But then I realized that I could just transport you in this cooler.
Uh, no reason.
Don't be silly.
There certainly isn't a merman in there, if that's what you're implying.
Who said anything about a merman?
I understand.
Hey, look!
Wendy in a bikini!
Sorry, Dipper!
I'm gonna get you home!
Pool law is dumb!
And so is your hat!
I'm okay.
I needed the cooler to save my new friend because he needs to go home and he's really nice and we combed each others' hair and he needs to be in the cooler because he breathes water because he's a merman!
Dipper, Mermando the merman.
He's a merman.
Oh, no!
Mermando!
Dipper, you're a lifeguard!
Give him CPR!
Then give him reverse CPR!
Doi!
Blackmail!
I've got it.
BRB.
Problem solved!
Dipper!
Don't you know what it's like to fall for someone?
Even though you know in your heart that it'll probably never work out, but you'd do anything for that person?
Thanks, Dip.
Same here.
Except for a zombie, a gnome, and a couple of cute vampires.
I don't tell you everything.
Well, Mermando, I guess this is it.
That was my first kiss!
Hey, it was also kind of your first kiss too, huh?
Huh?
Goodbye, Mermando.
You did the right thing, Dipper.
Oh, wait, wait!
One last thing!
Yes!
I've always wanted to do that.
Dear Mabel, I am home with my family and I am very happy
Hwaah!
Total domination!
I am the master of Attic Stuff Mini-golf!
From the mighty Swiss Alps!
To the badlands of Dipper's old laundry where man fears to tread!
The judges say it's out of bounds.
Hey!
Watch it!
Hey, Dipper, I gotta go hang out with Candy and Grenda tonight.
Don't be silly, I'm not leaving.
My friends are coming to me!
Okay, so how much do you like boys?
We are so crazy tonight!
Ugh, you're already so beautiful, Grenda.
What would be the point?
Come on, it's not that bad.
A makeover?
Ugh, what happened last night?
Whoa!
That was awesome, girls.
See you again soon!
Hey, brother!
Want any of this leftover pizza?
It's got glitter on it!
Ha ha!
That's great!
What?
I'm delightful to live with!
Get ready to be poked by the fun stick!
Boop!
Heh heh heh, yeah.
Grenda sure loves breaking things.
What?
Well if I can't have sleepovers, then you can't keep me up every night with your summer reading.
Grr, At least I wash my clothes once in a while.
Meow meow meow meow meow!
Meow meow meow!
Wah, uh, well maybe we shouldn't!
Double fine by me!
Yeah.
He's a reasonable guy.
Magic money pants, Classy...
This carpet is amazing!
What?
Why do you automatically get the room?
We both saw it at the same time.
Yeah we are!
Good decision Grunkle Stan!
No, Dipper, give it here!
Gimme it!
It's mine!
I'll kill you!
Hey brother.
Don't get too comfortable.
I just made Stan an omelet shaped like his own face.
Face it.
I'm like a suck-up ninja.
This room's as good as mine.
You might as well give up now.
What do you say?
Dipper?
Why are you wearing my clothes, and my, face?
Am I in your body?
Get out, get out, get out!
This is stupid!
Sharing a room was bad enough, now we're sharing bodies?
I don't know why you're so sweaty, and awkward.
Phew, ho ho!
Glad I'm switching back.
If I was you I would totally lose the contest.
Wait, what?
Wait!
Tie your shoes!
Hey Grunkle Stan!
Your face looks like a butt!
Breaking stuff is so much fun, I am Dipper and I stink!
Dipper should lose all his points!
Dipper?
Hey, wait!
Come back!
Wait, come back!
Hey, um, can I talk to my, sister, for a sec?
Gerard is just so fierce.
I—I should really be goin...
Goodbye childhood...
No, you should!
Give it to Mabel, you. big. jerk!
I said, uh, shut up old man!
You're fat and dumb and you're a dummy and, take that!
You can't!
You have to give it to Mabel!
'NOOOOOOOOOOO!
It's over, Dipper.
Stan gave you the room.
Wait a minute.
You can't have the room, if you can never get in!
Friends!
Hey guys, what's up?
Dipper!
Wa—wait!
Don't let him in here
No no, wait stop!
Wait!
Stop!
Guys, you have to listen to me!
I barely understand it.
All I know is that if you shuffle your feet on this carpet, you can switch bodies or whatever.
Dipper, give me that key back!
Everybody look.
Swap back in 3, 2...
Yeah, I'm me.
What's with you?
Why do you need that room so bad?
I never even wanted to move out!
Wait, what?
Say that again?
Then what was all this?
Aww, Dipper.
You're probably feeling awkward and sweaty, huh?
Here.
I won't fight you for it.
Well it looks like everyone's back to normal, Except for Soos, who may be a pig permanently...
Move it along, weird old man.
Good night Dipper.
So what are you gonna do with that new room?
This is fun, what you two have.
Don't worry about that.
Let's talk about why I'm doing this dance!
Do-do-do-do-do...
Wrong one-thousand!
It's because today is the greatest day of my life!
Sev'ral Timez is playing at the Gravity Falls Civic Center and Buffet!
You're making my dance sad...
You guys can't ruin this for me.
Mabel's got back up!
Who's ready for the greatest night of our lives?
How many times am I gonna love ya?
Should I go with lip balm or lip salve?
And those boys will fall in love with us.
What are you doing?
Oh, Dipper.
Girls just like musicians.
You'll understand when you're older.
Girls mature faster than guys.
Right, Grenda?
Ok, girls have you all practiced your obsessed boy band scream?
...Just gonna ignore that.
Tickets please!
I said we were going to meet Sev'ral Timez tonight, and I meant it!
And I'm not going to let a Keep out sign, keep us out!
Look!
This is it, girls.
You're finally going to meet the five cutest boys in the world!
Dipper's gonna eat his words that boy bands are fake.
That is one big hamster tube.
Someone's coming!
Trying not to let my brain explode.
I've always wanted to meet you guys!
But what was the deal with that scary chub-chub man?
That is straight brutal, Chubby Z.
If he loved you, he'd set you free!
Let's go right now.
Me and my friends can help you escape!
You can count on me!
I'm sorry, did you just call me beef?
Uh, money!
Money we stole!
Let's go away from here now!
It's your producer!
Guys, it's not safe out there!
Ergman's still looking for you!
Don't worry, guys.
He has to give up eventually.
Hey, in the meantime you guys can stay here with us!
Girls, do you realize what's happening here?
We have our very own pet boy band that we can do whatever we want with!
All aboard the braid train!
Braid braid!
Just—oh— just a few more minutes.
Oh, I finally got them to sleep.
Poor Greggy C.
He tried to eat a tape dispenser.
Ah, memories.
Not so fast!
They're not going anywhere.
Wait, girls.
Let's not be so hasty.
I mean, think about it.
If we don't tell the boys, then they can stay here with me—I mean, with us.
But I love them!
Never!
Every boy I've loved this summer has left me!
And I'm not gonna let it happen again!
Uhh, no!
Your producer's still out there!
You're gonna have to stay here, probably forever!
Sev'ral Timez!
Remove these two from the premises, please.
Thank you, boys.
Now let's get aboard the braid train.
I said, let's get aboard THE BRAID TRAIN!
Oh, boy!
Songs are like hugs that mouths give to ears!
Starting to feel guilty here, And that's why I've got to let you go.
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry I went bonkers.
A catchy song made me realize, that you were right.
Can you ever forgive me?
Yup.
This!
That, Chubby Z, is the sun.
That's nature, Deep Chris.
Bratsman won't bother you anymore.
You can do anything you wanna do, go anywhere you wanna go.
You're free!
Free!
You're free!
It means you can skedaddle!
Now go!
Get out of here before I change my mind!
Finally, Waddles, we have the whole house to ourselves!
What do you think?
Dance party?
I'm not hearing a no!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes... yes.
Uh oh! Cuddle time!
Waddles, can I tell you a secret?
You're my favorite pig in the whole world.
Being cute and great!
He's more like, Aaah! Let's solve a mystery!
I kiss a pillow with Wendy's face drawn on it!
Go, go!
Chew that pant leg!
Grunkle Stan!
It's not safe for Waddles outside!
There's predators!
And barbecuers!
He should be inside like a person.
And we're the lesser for it.
Maybe we're the ones who should be put outside.
Huh?
Huh?
Think about it!
Hmph!
Grunkle Stan!
I'm off to get a Huggy Wuvvy Tummy Bundle!
Nope.
Anyway, I need you to look after this little gentleman while I'm gone.
Grunkle Stan, I know you're not crazy about Waddles.
But you do care about me.
Promise me you won't let him outside.
Thanks Grunkle Stan!
What did you say about Waddles?
Woah.
Awkward silence.
BWAAAAH!
What's going on?
Why are you standing around are awkwardly? , And where's Waddles?
What happened?
What!
Waddles?
Waddles!
Oh no, how did this happen?
Grunkle Stan, you didn't put him outside?
Oh, Grunkle Stan, you tried to save him!
Oh, Waddles.
We follow that!
Waddles.
What?
Since when?
Look!
A fairy!
Let him down easy.
Okay, the red yarn leads to...
Old Man McGucket!
C'mon, Grunkle Stan, you can handle it!
You punched a pterodactyl in the face, remember?
Guys, we're going in.
Oh, Waddles.
We're gonna find you.
Wait- what did you just say?
You said the dinosaur flew INTO the house.
You put Waddles outside, then you lied to me about it!
And now thanks to you, my pig could be dead!
WADDLES COULD BE DEAD!
No, that's it.
Grunkle Stan, I am never ever speaking to you again!
Oh, is someone talking right now?
Because I can't hear them!
LA LA LA LA LA!
I can't hear anyone!
No one's talking to me!
Wait, did you hear that?
Waddles!
Oh, is someone speaking?
Because I can't hear anything!
Waddles!
Waddles, wait!
Guys!
We gotta save them!
It's working!
Waddles!
Waddles!
You saved him for me!
I can't believe you did all that for Waddles!
That's kinda sappy.
No, I mean.. Tough luck, sucker!
Waddles was bluffing.
I've been cheating the last 8 turns.
Miss!
Whop!
Remember when I wouldn't date him and he tried to destroy us?
Grunkle Stan, why can't we watch a movie that we'll all enjoy?
Dream Boy High!
Where love is on your permanent record.
You'll learn to like it.
Remember, bats are more afraid of you than you are of them.
Maybe I'm thinking of ducklings.
Ducklings.
Quack quack!
Quack quack quack!
I bet you can't!
Lick it!
Lick it!
Lick it!
Lick that elbow!
Lick that elbow!
Is that who I think it is?
Dipper!
We've gotta help Stan!
Grunkle Stan!
It is possible to follow the demon into a person's mind and prevent his chaos.
One must simply recite this incantation.
But if we don't do anything Gideon might steal the shack!
Or worse!
Whoa, this is Stan's mind?
Remember everyone, we've got to look out for the triangle guy.
You leave our uncle's brain alone, you isosceles monster!
Gotcha!
Wait, what?
Not if we stop you!
That's impossible, no one can guess what I'm thinking!
I'm never letting go of your leg!
They can help us!
Come on Dipper, we've gotta find the code before Bill does!
Whoa, it's Stan on a date!
We already know how Stan feels about us!
He loves us!
We're great.
Alright guys, I have a good feeling about this door.
Sweet Sally!
If we wanna find Stan's memory, we gotta think like Stan.
He's always hiding stuff, right?
Soos, that's it!
Look!
Um, um, 
Let's just destroy the door before Bill can find it!
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a-a stink face!
Don't treat me like a child, Xyler.
Come on!
We've gotta save Stan!
Dipper, I'm sure that's not true.
Dipper, it doesn't matter what you saw.
If we don't stop Bill, we'll lose the Shack!
Fine.
Come on, Soos.
We'll save Stan ourselves.
Ha ha!
Boom!
My cuteness!
What did you do to my - cuteness?
My dream boys!
Dipper!
Huh?
We can do anything?
Like have kittens for fists?
Po-pow!
P-p-pow!
Pow!
Well hello, friends!
Hamster ball shields activate!
Rise, Xyler!
Rise, Craz!
Out of Stan's mi-ind!
Will I ever see you guys again?
We did it!
I'm just glad Gideon didn't get into the safe.
I really love this old shack.
Oh, Soos, your grandma is so adorable!
And her skin is old lady soft.
Haaaahhh!
Don't worry, Dipper.
Looks like Mabel's going to have to be the hero of the family now.
I'll defeat Gideon with my grappling hook!
Oh yeah?
Jelly grab!
Just gonna say it, I don't know what we're doing here, but I'm loving these fake mustaches.
Waddles!
You monster!
Arrest him, officers!
Where are we gonna stay, Dipper?
Where am I gonna put all my sweaters?
Grunkle Stan, can we order pizza?
Go red car!
Gideon may have the upper hand, but we have something he doesn't.
A grappling hoo- oh.
The Journal, Journal!
Leave that to Mabel.
Wa-chaw!
Whoa, what's this?
BORING!
To defeat those guards we need some kind of army.
I wonder what Gnomes do out here all alone in the forest?
Ew, hardly.
We need your help.
And seriously, ew!
But what if we were able to get you a new queen?
One even more beautiful than me.
Yes, you are supposed to say that.
Now!
What?
Dipper, don't give up!
You always have a plan!
Hey, Dipper, wanna play bus seat treasure hunt?
Aw, come on!
We got Canadian coins, gum that shaped like Ronald Reagan's head, ooh!
Miscellaneous fluid stain?
Yeah, a giant robot, Wait, what?
Bus driver!
There is a giant Gideon bot coming towards us!
Soos, look out!
Dipper!
Help me!
HELP!
Careful in there!
GRAPPLING HOOK!
Told you it will come in handy!
Not amazing as you defeating that robot!
Hey, Grunkle Stan!
Yep!
All of my favorite moldy spots on the ceiling are still there!
Even you, Daryl.
Dipper, you don't need that book!
Don't you see?
On your own you defeated a giant robot with nothing but your bare hands!
You're a hero whether you've got that journal or not!
I'm sure you'll get it back.
What would a boring old man like Stan want with that book anyway?
Everybody say Something stupid!
We're doing a karaoke bonanza, people!
Light!
Music!
Enchantment!
And an amazing karaoke performance by our family band, Love Patrol Alpha!
Too late!
I wrote your names on the list!
It's happening!
Bro, you looked at that thing like, a bazillion times.
There's nothing left to discover!
Half the pages are blank, remember?
Don't worry Dipper!
Lord Mystery Ham is on the case!
I play by me own rules!
Wot?
Wot?
Grunkle Stan, what's happening?
Haha!
Zing!
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan is right.
We're throwing a party tonight!
Can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?
Trust me Dipper, the only book you'll need tonight is right here: Boop!
I say kara–, you say –oke!
kara– , kara– , kara– .
I could do this all day.
Well, the confetti cannon works!
And the karaoke machine has all the best songs!
We Built This Township on Rock and Roll, Danger Lane to Highway Town, Taking Over Midnight by &ndra!
Grunkle Stan, karaoke is not about sounding good, it's about sounding terrible, TOGETHER.
See for yourself!
Hey boys!
Looking good!
Gorney!
You clean up nice!
Mr Poolcheck move those crazy legs.
You, you weird pool man.
What's the problem officers?
Did you catch my face going ninety smiles per hour?
Welcome to your dreams!
What do you say guys is this party legendary?
When I say Mabel you say Pines!
Why does that never work?
Wait, no!
Don't leave!
We haven't even done our family karaoke song yet!
Dipper, what's the one thing I asked you not to do tonight?
And what did you do?
Don't panic.
Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob?
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?
Take that, sucka!
This thing's a surprisingly good weapon!
Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?
DIPPER!
What do we do, what do we do?
Wait, wait, wait!
The text!
It's glowing in the black light!
Boys, boys.
I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
Hello?
Hello?
Is this thing on?
Zombies and gentlemen!
I'm Mabel, they're Dipper and Stan, and together we're Love Patrol Alpha!
Hit it!
Roll in to the party, the boys are lookin' our way.
We just keep dancing', we don't care what they say!
And all the boys are gettin' up in my face– Aah!
Guys, we have to sing together or it won't work!
DUCK!
Thank you!
We'll be here all night!
Dipper, are you kidding me?
I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world!
No party could ever top that.
Ooh, and cinnamon!
Soos, cut it out!
Hey, when there's a mystery, you can count on your sister...
Uh oh!
Inviting Wendy on our mission?
Me thinks there's romance afoot!
Hah!
YOU'RE over Wendy?
Allow me to put on my skepticals.
Whooop!
Skepticals...
Haha!
My face feels fuzzy!
Not as creepy as Dipper's internet history!
Heyo!
Haha, it's hard to be scared with caterpillars on your face.
Wall things!
Crazy wall things happening right now!
Dipper!
What do we do?
Run for it!
Hey bro, you forgot your vest.
What the..
OHMYGOSH!
Hey.
Dipper!
Look what I found...
I knew it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
You're not over Wendy at all!
And you were gonna tell her today?
Dipper, you should just tell her already.
One way or another, you'll feel better afterwards.
He wants to tell her but he's scared... maybe he needs a little push.
Good idea, Mabel.
Thanks, Mabel!
Brother, whatever happens I just you need to know something: this is for your own good.
Oh, I'll let you out Dipper, as soon as you tell Wendy that thing you've been wanting to tell her!
You'll thank me for this later!
Om nom, That's besides the point!
Ha ha, nice try!
The only monsters are your own inner demons, Dipper!
Come on Dipper!
Now's the time, bro!
Razzle dazzle!
Look at this tube-y thing!
Frozen!
Unfrozen!
Frozen!
Unfrozen!
What's this?
Experiment number 210: the shape shifter.
I thought he was just joking!
DIPPER!
Leave that to Mabel!
It's a fun hazard.
Now let me light the way!
What happened?
What do we do?
Oh boy, Dipper.
That book sure is full of some great monsters!
Frozen!
Boop!
Yeah, but you gotta admit we're all total heroes.
Syrup on cereal!
Sooo?
How did it go?
Everything!
All the time!
I'm so sorry for being so pushy Dipper.
If it's any consolation, I'm already working on your list of potential rebound crushes.
And a really busted up one too.
It's here!
Aaah!
Oh, it's here!
It's here, it's here!
I've been waiting all morning and it's finally here!
The Gravity Falls Gossiper accepted my article about summer fashion tips for squirrels.
My picture is gonna be in the newspaper!
Check it!
Woah, woah, WHAT?
Ugh, Pacifica!
She always ruins everything!
Aack!
I need something to get my mind off this.
Why yes!
Maybe a little.
Ahh, mini-golf!
The sport of mini champions!
Don't worry, bro!
You're still, Eh!
Ext-roar-dinary!
Do the hip wiggle, and eh!
You can do it, Mabel!
Pretend the ball is Pacifica's face!
Aw, nuts!
Pacifica!
Well it can't buy you skill!
You walked into the game of a mini-golf champion!
Oh, yeah?
Well, I want a rematch, you, you WALKING ONE-DIMENSIONAL BLEACHED BLONDE VALLEY GIRL STEREOTYPE!
I'll be here!
I'll be here!
Puh!
Puh!
Hair in my mouth.
Puh!
Time to scratch mini-golf off my talents list.
Oh yeah?
Well the section for people who lost at mini-golf is OVER THERE!
You're right, guys.
I just need to practice a little more before midnight.
Darn!
Poop heck darn!
What?
What is it?
Yeah!
Are you guys tiny humans, or enormous mini-humans?
That's incredible!
We kind of have to play this golf tournament against my rival, Pacifica.
Guys, guys, calm down!
Your fighting is inadvertently adorable!
Uh, I don't know, guys.
I'm not sure I wanna get involved in your weird mini-blood feud.
I'm not sure, Dipper.
I wanna beat Pacifica, but doesn't this seem like, cheating?
People of the eighteen holes!
We're going to have a game of mini-golf!
And whoever does the best job helping me win, gets the sticker!
Just remember, as long as you're helping me, no fighting.
Looking for someone?
Oh, I guess you could say we've got a little something, right, right?
Okay, guys?
That was bedonkulous!
I don't wanna call it out early, but I think the miners might have one of these in their future!
Dipper, is it bad that I feel good about her feeling bad?
What are you guys doing?
ENOUGH!
You know what?
No one gets the sticker!
No, no.
Nuh-uh.
No booing- stop, no!
No one gets the sticker cuz you're all being jerks!
I mean, why can't you all just get along?
Well then, maybe, maybe rivalries are dumb.
Maybe you don't settle them with petty competitions.
Maybe the only way to be da best is by ending the fighting and working together!
Uh, you guys aren't appreciating the lesson here!
I have to save Pacifica first!
You know, on second thought, maybe I won't untie you.
That's what I thought.
You ready to putt?
Just shut up and putt!
Gun it!
Oh yeah?
What's ten minus six?
I'm sorry, Pacifica.
We shouldn't have cheated.
You totally would have beat me, fair and square.
Hey!
Your parents aren't here.
Want a ride home?
Hey, I found two tacos!
Yeah!
The car is where secret surprise snacks happen!
Want one?
Handouts?
It's called sharing!
You do know what sharing is, right?
Just take it.
I think we made some progress.
The important thing to remember is that at the end of the day, she's just an ordinary kid like us.
Agreed!
Big day!
Oh, I'm ready, baby.
Ma-ma.
Don't you worry, bro bro.
With your brains and my laser focus, there is literally nothing that can distract us from...
Did you hear that?
Ba bump.
Ba bump.
Just when I was getting over Mermando, of course, you show up at my doorstep.
Hey!
Guess who's Mabel!
I am.
Care to learn more?
I bet you do.
You like to learn, WAA And I'm up!
You're amazing with those puppets.
Are you kidding me?
I'm puppet-CRAZY!
People call me Puppet-Crazy-Mabel!
My huh?
Ha, yeah, I mean I'm TOTALLY working on a puppet show.
There are soooo many details...
Dipper, how hard do you think it'd be to write and compose a sock puppet rock opera with lights, original music and live pyrotechnics by Friday?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!
I got lost in his eyes and his ponytails and I'm gonna be so embarrassed on Friday if I don't have ANYTHING.
If you help me with this for JUST a couple of days I promise I'll help with the password!
Please, pretty please!
It's for love, Dipper.
YES!
THANK YOU!
THIS GUY!
HE'S NUMBER ONE!
Alright.
This is gonna be called Glove Story: A Sock Opera.
Just to warn you, people's eyes will get wet.
Cause they'll be crying. From laughter! From how tragic it is.
Puppet boy, Puppet boy, you're the boy I...
Goodnight, my babies.
Mwop mwop mwop mwop.
Mwah!
Soon, Gabe Benson...
Don't stay up all night, Dipper.
Last time you got this sleep-deprived you tried to eat your own shirt.
Hey, I'm puppet Staaaannn!
Dipper, I told you to get some sleep last night!
Here, wake up with some Mabel Juice.
It has plastic dinosaurs in it!
Wait, hold up, the triangle guy?
Don't worry, bro.
Today's the day that the mystery twins are back in action.
I'll help you crack that code.
I've just got to hand off my puppet stuff to my production crew.
It's so great to see you!
I was just working on the world's greatest puppet show.
IT HAS PUPPETS!
Cross-huh?
NATURALLY!
Hahahaha!
GWAAA!
We gotta up our game, girls!
Did you hear that thing he said about the stitches?
AAA!
Okay, I'm back on fabrication.
Get me my lint roller!
DIPPER!
This sock crisis just bumped up to code argyle!
The laptop can wait!
I'm obsessed?
Look at you!
You look like a vampire!
And not the hot kind!
Oh, I can help you.
With tickles!
Hey Dipper!
I borrowed your journal to use as a prop in the show I hope you don't mind I'm gonna go before you process this sentence okay BYEE!
Hey guys!
You all made it!
I used it as a prop for the big wedding scene!
I still need a reverend, though.
Right!
Let's go!
Look, it's Mabel!
Finally, we're together.
Whew, okay, you can do this, Mabel.
Only 36 more musical numbers.
Aah!
It's come to life!
The puppetbooks didn't warn me about this!
Wait, what, Dipper?
But you're, so much more of a sock than usual!
But my cue's coming up any minute!
You drive a biscotti?
Did you hear that?
He loves it!
This play has to be flawless.
Can't we wait until after the show?
I'm sorry, it, it looks funny when you're mad.
Okay, okay, okay, just take over for me till I get back with the book.
Little puppet face!
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on now, there must be a way to get Dipper's body back!
Bill Dipper!
Bipper.
No way!
This is Dipper's!
I'd never give it away!
Dipper would.
Get out of my brother's body, you evil triangle!
True, but you're in Dipper's body.
And I know all his weaknesses!
Tickle, tickle!
A little note about the human body- You haven't slept for 24 hours!
Also, I got a full night's sleep and I'm on four mega-shots of Mabel Juice!
I'm sorry, Gabe.
Don't worry.
I've seen enough movies to know this is the part where the audience thinks it was all part of the show and loves it.
Cue applause!
Gabe!
Stick around for the wrap party?
We've got mini-quiches!
I might've dodged a bullet there.
Well, one of them survived.
And she has something to say to you.
I'm sorry, Dipper.
I spent all week obsessing over a dumb guy.
But the dumb guy I should have cared about was you!
Bap!
Mystery twins?
Nothing a little sleep can't fix.
Come on, bro bro, let's go home.
Hey Dipper, what did one sock puppet say to the other sock puppet?
You look like you could use a HAND!
La, la, la, la, la!
Braces!
Braces caught in the screen door!
Someone dictate my will, I'm giving it all to Waddles!
Aaaah.
Soos!
You saved me!
You ever wonder what Soos does when he's not here at the Mystery Shack?
Did someone say flirting?
Finally, my prayers for a chance to match-make this summer have been answered!
We're taking you where romance lives and fashion styles die.
To the mall!
Alright, Soos.
Are you ready to explode the charm bomb on these poor, unsuspecting ladies?
You can't be any worse at this than Dipper.
And, flirt!
Eye contact!
Conversation!
Confidence.
Don't worry, Soos.
You'll find the right girl.
You just need to stick with it!
Haha!
Anything to get you out there, Soos.
We'll take our chances.
Yeah!
I wore my motivational sweater and everything thing!
I messed up that part.
Uh, Soos?
Soos, maybe it's time to apply these skills with real girls!
Soos, you don't have to wish it goodbye.
It's just a game.
It's not like it's going anywhere.
Dang!
Where all dem sweet honeys at?
I'll check the ladies' bathroom.
It's love time, girls!
Get out there!
No time to wash your hands!
It's time to date!
Date!
Date!
This is the best day of my life!
You don't need it anymore... you can toss it out!
You can do this, Soos!
Just remember what your love crew taught you.
How does she look?
What are her stories?
And who's going to pay for dinner?
They grow up so fast.
Soos, what are you doing out there?
Spirit of love, we did it!
Swap meet, swap meet, swap meet!
Look at all these priceless treasures!
Bobbly heads!
They agree with everything I say.
Wow.
Someone needs to work on their social skills.
NO HANDS!
GRUNKLE STAN!
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HANDS?
Lalala, Hands makeover!
Say hello to you new hands!
In quotes.
According to the Swap Meet pamphlet, the Hand Witch lives in a horrible Hand Witch lair, on Hand Witch Mountain.
Grunkle Stan, did you just tap my shoulder?
You just need to redecorate!
For example: A Handalabra!
Then watch me work.
HOME MAKEOVER!
Redecorate!
Brand new you!
Shake it around!
You gotta do it to make it work!
Okay, time to take a look at your fantastic new cave.
Men will definitely tolerate you, now.
And I left a book of pick up lines on the end table.
Ooo!
That's a BUMMER!
This is May May and THE HOGG!
Coming at you on the AM!
Woah!
Not sure we can say that on the air!
Don't touch that dial, truckers!
Cause the Hogg just ate it.
Maybe you're just not smart enough.
Huh!
Dipper, look!
Waddles!
What happened to you?
Have you been possessed by the spirit of a nerd!
THIS ISN'T RIGHT!
THE PIG GOES OINK!
THE PIG GOES OINK!
Yeah!
He's uh.
He's definitely, uh, different.
Uh, Waddles!
Don't you want to stay up here and record some morning pranks with me?
Right.
Yeah.
You guys.
Just go on without me.
Welcome to May May and the Hogg.
Top story today: coping with crippling loneliness after losing my co-host.
What did that nasty goop do to you?
You're not happier like this, are you?
What the heck is going on here?
The whole world?
But when will you have time for us?
I'm your best friend.
But what about helping me?
Do you really want to spend your whole life in meetings with dumb smart guys?
This brain junk has made you forget who you are.
Don't you remember, Oh, Waddles!
I know what'll make you feel better: a simple hug from a simple pig.
Ooo, old people movies.
Get ready for references we don't understand, and words we can't repeat.
The cyclops!
His face is made of nightmares!
No talking.
They wait for you to talk and then crawl inside your mouth!
Oh, what do I do?
How can I defeat those monstrosities?
Hey.
I changed into something I like.
Woah.
I think I have an idea!
Hey, One-Eyeclopses!
Yeah, I'm talking to you, dumb-dumb!
Come at me!
WOOAAAAA!
Wipe that face off your face!
Oh, I've got big plans for you.
Hey, skeleton dorks!
IT'S CLAYBACK TIME!
JAM, IT, TWINKLEHEART!
Just start pounding those skeletons!
Oh, I'm scared twice as much now.
But now I know it's rational!
I'm just glad that none of us got turned into clay.
Hey!
Wanna play tic-tac-toe?
Hey, I wanted to be Xs!
Let me be Xs.
Yaaay!
Actually, I'm sorry, I changed my mind... I want to be Os.
Okay, you're gooonna hate me right now, but could Xs be a possibility?
I don't think you're playing this right.
Open to a shot of Greasy's Diner.
Lazy Susan is locking up the diner for the night..
Hey, bro-bro.
Look what I got!
It's a bottle message from Mermando, remember?
He was part fish, part shirtless guy.
What if he wants to get back together?
Too late!
Hopes are way way up!
Dear Mabel,  So far so good!
It is with a heavy heart, So far so good!
that I must inform you, I'm getting married?
In order to prevent an undersea civil war, arranged wedding, Queen of the Manatees? And she's so beautiful!
This can't be happening!
You don't understand, Dipper.
On my first day here, I made this page for summer romances.
Look at my luck.
Turned out to be gnomes, child psycho, made out with his own hands.
And now, I wish I could just forget about them forever.
Wait a minute.
Dipper, look!
Just do it.
You don't think?
We'll explain on the way!
Oh, you poor old man!
No wonder your mind's all...
You've been through something intense.
Oh Wendy, everything I look at reminds me of failed romances.
That formaldehyde heart.
That romantic diorama.
Even this poster of my most recent ex-crush.
Aw, come on!
Lazy Susan?
I think she looks beautiful, Soos!
I just don't get it, Wendy.
I hug a lot, I can burp the alphabet, I have scratch and sniff clothing.
Why does every boy leave me?
Maybe I come on too strong, you know?
I'm Mabel!
I'm twelve and i own a pig!
Want to get married?
Wendy, that's it.
Forget about guys!
I just need to type summer romances into this thing, and I won't feel bad about them anymore.
Or one of those terrible summer songs you can't get out of your head?
All ideas are good ideas!
What's with your creepy British accent?
Toby Determined?
Ha ha, maybe...
I only love some of my stuffed animals, and the guilt is killing me!
It isn't so fun being tied up, is it?
Hey, wanna draw on their faces?
Tra-la-la, 
Your name is Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle.
You're a traveling banjo minstrel, with a song in your heart, and funny tattoos on your head.
We've come all this way.
Go on.
Oh, McGucket, I'm so sorry.
But did you want those memories back?
You know, no one likes having bad memories, but maybe it's better to remember the bad things and learn from them than to go all denial crazy trying to forget.
Yep.
Miss Mature.
That's me.
Hey, you wanna help me vandalize this picture of my jerky ex-crush?
Everything is terrible forever!
Forget taking off the wrappers!
I'm eating these now!
Agh!
That was a mistake!
Hack!
Haw!
Wait!
I've never seen Soos' wallet before.
Don't you wanna learn some Soos secrets?
And look.
Emergency salami!
Soos, my respect for you has grown.
Woah...
Uh-duh!
It's probably because he wants someone to throw him a surprise party... I can relate.
I've been waiting for a surprise party my whole life.
Too little, too late, Chiu.
More exclamation points!
More I say!
Grenda, twins are born birthday experts.
Happy birthday, you king on Earth!
We got everything you love.
Cake-flavored pizza, pizza-flavored cake, and one more treat...
Quick!
Everyone pose for the birthday smiles memory album!
There's gotta be something we can do!
You're right, Dipper!
It's time for us to bring out the big guns!
Um, we definitely didn't rifle through your wallet?
We promise, no matter what happens, we won't leave your side.
Whoa, this is even cooler than I imagined!
Look how real these laser guys are!
Wait, what?
The time traveler guy!
What did you say your name was again?
Blendo, Blondin, There it is!
It's our friend's birthday today, and we promised we wouldn't leave his side!
Is this a reality show?
Are we in Japan?
Dipper, we need a way out of here!
But how?
Hang in there Soos, we're coming for you.
Oh my stars!
Could it be?
My little, uh-hum, Lolphie!
It's me!
Your great-great-great--great-great-great--great grandmother!
From the past times.
I ain't no one's Gam Gam, sucka!
You just got time-tricked!
Hurry!
Back to Soos' birthday!
Uh, Are we back?
Time travel, man!
Why you gotta be so complicated?
Oh no!
The timey thing, it's busted!
Can you fix it?
Wow, ten years in the past.
Everything is same-y, but also different-y.
This dream goes nowhere, Toby!
Heheh, now you know how she feels, creep.
Now's our chance!
Allow me.
You just need to know a guy on the inside.
Bippidy-boop.
Wop!
Jackpot!
Dipper, Dipper.
Look.
Big day?
This could be the birthday where that personal biz went down.
We could finally find out why Soos hates his birthday.
So, how much partying can fix that
Ugh, this is awful.
...Then we can wish that Soos' dad came to his twelfth birthday!
But do you really think we can win Globnar?
That is one big baby.
And we have hair!
Got it!
Sorry.
Got carried away...
Yeah, and he's kind of too sad to be a real bad guy.
And give him pretty hair!
Thank you, but the wish, isn't for us.
And there was a time cyclops...
But, the point is, Soos, we think we know how to fix your birthday.
But the choice is yours.
Wait what?
Whoa!
That cloud looks like a chipmunk!
Look at the clouds!
Ooh!
That cloud looks like a big heart-shaped balloon!
Ghosty sounds!
Cemetery ghosty sounds!
Wait!
You guys!
He's in pain.
We can't just ditch him here.
But he's suffering.
How can I be happy if I know someone else is sad?
It totally throws off my happiness chart.
You know what Robbie needs?
A new girl!
Romance is like gum.
Once it's lost its flavor, you just cram another one in.
It is if you're the world's greatest matchmaker!
I've never had an unhappy customer... like Soos and Melody.
Match made!
And then, of course, there's Waddles and Gompers.
Match made!
Hopeless case, ehhh?
Alright, Mabel.
Robbie's a broken teacup and you're going to piece him back together.
Okay, this could get intense.
It is intense.
You're Robbie's parents?
I always thought he was, like, raised by sad wolves or something.
Oh, no time for crackers, sorry.
I'm here to cheer Robbie up.
Cannot have a dry cracker mouth for that.
Lady, I like your style.
Robbie!
It's Mabel!
Remember me?
I'm like girl-Dipper!
I heard a come in!
And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it.
Listen, Robbie, I always used to see you as a creepy jerk, like the human version of rat poison.
But when I saw you in the cemetery today, I realized, Robbie's not a bad guy.
He's just a heartbroken soul who needs love and gloves with fingers.
No they don't.
Robbie, you just need a good matchmaker.
I guarantee I'll find you true love or twice your sadness back.
I guarantee it.
Okay, Gravity Falls, who wants to go out with Robbie?
Okay.
Lazy Susan?
Too old.
Grenda, too young.
Multi-Bear?
I'm putting you in the maybe pile.
Who could it be?
Who could it be?
What's that Wompers?
Someone we already know?
But who could possibly be superficial and gothy enough for–?
Of course, that's it!
You two really are America's favorite power couple.
Love is about to happen, Lazy Susan.
Watch and learn.
What?
How is this possible?
I'm supposed to be the best matchmaker ever.
I must know how this works.
Love God?
Mabel here.
Big fan.
Can I just say, that was some of the finest matchmaking I've ever seen?
Can you please, please tell me your secret?
Love God.
Are you an actual love god?
That's, great.
So, anyway.
Can you make anything fall in love?
Like that snake and that badger?
They're gonna make a snadger.
How are you doing that?
I need that potion.
How much would it cost?
And will you accept squirrels as payment?
Mind if I add a little something to these fries?
Match made!
Sorry, guys, but Tambry's a little busy at the moment.
Wink.
Wink.
Let's just say she and Robbie took a trip to Smoochville.
Now everyone's happy.
How's that?
Match made?
I know, I know.
I just wanted to be a good matchmaker.
I never should have gotten that love potion from the Love God.
That's it!
If I undo the spell then everyone will be friends again!
But I'm gonna need your help.
Also, you are not pulling off that v-neck.
Burn it!
Dipper, come on.
Now's our chance.
Here we go.
Let's see.
Puppy-love.
Interspecies love.
Love of country music.
Ew.
Anti-love!
To reverse the effects of love potion simply spray on your victim and watch their heart die on the inside.
I'm sorry, but I made a mistake and I have to fix it.
I'm sorry Love God!
But it's for the good of my friends.
Dipper catch!
Ooh!
Thank you.
Dipper, look.
Just one clean shot to the back of their heads and everything's fixed.
Sure you can all marry me.
Oh, guy from the $10 bill, I forgot I had a crush on you.
Ugh!
Curse my over-sized heart.
Please be immortal.
Please be immortal.
Dipper, maybe we shouldn't do this.
I mean, every time we play with peoples' fates it's only made things worse.
Well, maybe it'll sort itself out.
I mean, there's gotta be something that could bring everyone back together.
I think every just might be all right.
It's starting!
They say each gift basket has a live quail inside!
Hi, Pacifica!
Excuse us!
Dipper!
Don't you see what this means?
If you help Pacifica, you could get us invites to the greatest party of all time!
But it's Candy and Grenda's dream!
Grenda, get the glue gun.
We're making dresses!
Everything's so fancy!
Fancy floors, fancy plants, fancy man!
Forget the quail, I'm putting him in my guest basket!
There are tons of cute boys coming.
Let's swear a sisters' truce not to waste time on Marius.
Candy, listen to me carefully.
You're caught in a sweet-savory loop.
Put the fondue fork down.
Guten take-me-now!
Huh, me too, Candy.
But what do we do?
He's unattainable!
It is the perfect plan, but what about Grenda?
I'm Mabel.
So, Australia, huh?
Do you guys eat kangaroo meat over there, or, are they, strictly pets?
Tag!
Tag!
If you were a boat, do you know what kind you'd be?
A dream boat.
That's what kind.
I tagged back in!
I can tag myself!
It's allowed!
Your flirting style can come off as a bit, intense...
Oh, man, what happened?
We shouldn't have left you behind.
Whoa-ho-ho!
Go Grenda!
What?
I call co-bridesmaid!
Okay, so I was just opening random doors, because I'm a creep, when I found something amazing!
Feast your eyes!
Bro.
Bro.
We're both thinking it.
I am the god of destruction!
Heyoooo!
With water balloons?
To Grunkle Stan!
Not just a great uncle...
Ha-ha!
Don't worry.
We've still got plenty of summer left to drive each other crazy!
What the...? Wait!
Grunkle Stan! You've got the wrong guy!
Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift the occasional tangerine, but he's not some evil super villain!
What're you gonna do to us?
Dipper, this is crazy.
There's no way Stan was stealing hazardous waste!
We gotta clear his name!
We just need to think of a way out of here.
Think, Mabel, Think.
Sevral Timez is overrated
Haha, yes!
Come on, Dipper.
We're gonna go clear our uncle's name.
Alright, here's the plan.
I'll take out those two guard guys, you karate chop the other dude in the neck and then we'll back flip through the front door!
Oh, right.
Wait!
The antelabbit!
Pfft, that can't be right.
It's this week, this is it!
Someone yelled Wormy Dance.
We had to!
Fast-forward.
Uh, maybe he's just going to the bathroom outdoors.
The way nature intended!
Don't panic.
That could be anyone in that suit!
Okay, okay, so maybe Grunkle Stan stole some toxic waste.
That doesn't mean he's leading a nefarious double life!
What?
What is all this?
Stetson Pinefield?
But why would Stan do that?
Foul play suspected in Pines' death.
Fiery car crash, brakes cut, by who?
Isn't, There has to be some explanation.
Maybe we're getting Ker-Prank'd!
Justin Kerprank is gonna jump up from behind one of these plants any minute now!
...Any minute, Justin.
Ugh, there's gotta be some kind of explanation in here somewhere.
What the, secret code to hideout?
Wait! I have!
Dipper, it's the vending machine!
Yeah, just let us through so we can prove this is all just a big misunderstanding.
I'm sorry, Soos.
Or a dream, Guys, are we dreaming?
Somebody wake me up.
Okay, okay, so he's got a huge gigantic lab.
That doesn't mean anything bad!
Everyone's got secrets!
It's still Stan, and he loves us.
And we love him.
Right?
Dipper!
Grunkle Stan, I don't even know, if you're my grunkle!
I wanna believe you, but...
Grunkle Stan, I trust you.
Is this the part where one of us faints?
Hey, hi.
Mabel here.
Quick question: What the heck is going on here?
Whoa, a six-fingered handshake?
It's a full finger friendlier than normal!
Well, it looks like we're stuck down here for a while.
Who wants to tell us their entire mysterious backstory?
But your name is Stanford.
And what happened between you and your brother?
This story's so sad!
I know what you two little broken teacups need: to hug it out!
Hug it out!
Hug train's comin' in the station.
HUGAPOLOOZA!
Two thousand!
Whoa.
So that explains all the fake IDs.
What do we do?
Great uncle Stanford, that was amazing!
Did you hear what they said?
I think Grunkle Ford said they're gonna buy us puppies made of ice cream.
Might be wishful thinking, though.
Yeah.
I liked the way things were here before.
Just us and Stan and the occasional goblin-monster.
Dipper, you don't think we'll turn out like Stan and Ford, do you?
I mean, they used to be best friends, but then they got all stupid.
Can you promise me you won't get stupid?
Good night, stupid.
I just ate a bag of Cheese Boodles without using my hands.
Lazy Tuesday, you are delivering in a big way!
Can we keep it?
Aww, Dipper, don't take it so hard.
Yeah!
Besides, the season finale of Duck-tective is airing this Friday!
That's all the mystery you'll need this week.
Quack with us, Dipper!
Quack, quack quack quack, Quack quack quack, a quack quack quaaaacck.
Quuaaaaa, Why isn't he quacking?
Dear Mom and Dad, we've been in Gravity Falls for a few months and so much has happened!
Just yesterday gravity reversed itself, almost destroying the universe and totally wrecking the whole town!
But the coolest part of the summer was when Grunkle Stan's twin brother came out of this portal-thingy.
Now we have two grunkles for the price of one!
And they are adorable together!
We love each other so much!
Dogs!
Dogs with hats!
Well, I do like unicorns, and that hot elf looks promising.
How do you play?
And then we ride unicorns?
This is like Homework: The Game.
Oh, wow, would you look at that: two people!
Haha, say it again!
Okay.
We've got everything we need to watch the season finale of Duck-tective tomorrow.
I even made mouth-ramps so we can pour food into our mouths without taking our eyes off the screen.
Nom nom nom.
Hahaha!
That is so messed up!
Dipper would LOVE that!
Dipper, are you going to go to sleep?
You've been saying dork words for hours.
You're uh, spending a lot of time with old Fordsy lately, huh?
Give 'im time, haha!
Heyooo!
Nah, you got me.
You got me.
Thanks for coming over to watch tonight's Duck-tective finale, Grenda!
Hey-hey, look at you!
Someone's all dressed up.
Viewing positions, everyone!
Dipper, could you maybe move this to another room?
Grunkle Stan, it starts in a few minutes!
Oh no!
That crazy wizard is going to eat our brothers' brains!
We have to stop 'em!
Grunkle Stan!
We're coming for you, Dipper!
And Great uncle Ford!
And possibly that hot elf, if he's got anything to do with this.
Is he, dead?
YOUR BUTT!
Imagination?
Grunkle Stan, make something up!
It's just like lying!
I cast: Giggle Time Bouncy Boots!
Hot flamey sword!
Super hot flamey sword!
I cast: CENTAURTAUR!
YAH!
Go go go, Dipper go!
You can do it!
Yeaahh!
I'll think of some weapons!
I cast DEATH MUFFINS!
Yeeaah!
Hahaha!
Man!
That was fun for ages 8 to 80!
Or a million or however old you guys are!
He had a twin brother all along?
the big twist we've been waiting for!
Does anyone see this?
This is what a hero looks like right here.
He looks good!
Considering we threw his son in jail.
Wow, a colorful piece of paper?
He's got my vote!
Loving you, Tad!
Grunkle Stan, what are you doing?
Grunkle Stan, it's not that we think you can't do it, it's just
You're right, Dipper.
Besides, Stan has a kind-of charisma.
How hard could getting him elected be?
Okay Grunkle Stan, are you ready for your first radio interview?
Okay you're on with the candidate.
Look Grunkle Stan, people are like smell markers, and you're black licorice!
It's not that you're un-sniffable, you just need to learn when to keep the cap on.
You really think this mind-controlling tie is gonna work?
That's amazing!
Mind control is awesome!
Grunkle Stan, just trust your lucky tie.
You're on, Grunkle Stan!
Okay, we'll only jump in if he starts doing badly.
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
It's applause!
Grunkle Stan, they love you!
Grunkle Stan, what's with the outfit?
You're missing your lucky tie.
Seriously though, we need you to wear that suit and tie, Grunkle Stan.
Dipper!
What we need is a blank slate, someone totally suggestible!
An empty piece of clay we can mold to our whims.
I don't know!
It doesn't make sense!
He's almost acting just like, like, Let go of us!
You'll never get away with this, you creepy little dork!
Eww, I'd rather die, you creep!
Help!
Help us!
We're sorry, Grunkle Stan.
We should've supported you, win or lose.
Stan, what did you do?
Hey, I knit you something.
It's not official, but I think it fits.
Let's see, Battlechutes & Ladderships, Necronomiconopoly, Don't Wake Stalin...
Well, I know what we're doing today.
Ooh, mysterious scrolls and potions!
Are you going to tell us we're finally of age to go to wizard school?
Is there an owl in this bag?
Dipper's been pretty paranoid since Bill turned him into a living sock puppet.
Once with kittens and once with tickles!
Grunkle Ford, can I please go on this quest?
I am literally obsessed with unicorns!
My first word was unicorn, I once made my own unicorn by taping a traffic cone to a horse's head.
Are you even looking at the sweater I'm wearing right now?
Not to mention that I'm probably the most pure of heart person in this room.
So can I go on a mission to get that hair?
Please please please?
I'll give you my blood!
Pssh, come on, dawg.
Candy, Grenda, Wendy, clear the afternoon!
It's nice to finally be out on a mission, just us gals!
Candy, I will make sure you lick that unicorn's neck, because I care about my friends.
Stop!
This is the magic part of the forest.
Let's see, the gnome tavern is over there, the fairy nail salon is over there, but it says that to summon the unicorn, one must bellow this ancient chant droned only by the deepest-voiced druids of old.
I'll take that bet.
The paintings airbrushed on the sides of vans were true!
Eh, eh.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
What's your name?
Celestabellebethabelle, we have journeyed far and wide--
On a mission to protect our family with your magical hair!
Presenting: bum buh da bum bum ba bum bum! Mabel!
I guess I do make fun of Dipper a lot.
And I did just shatter a window with a crossbow.
No, girls, she's right.
I used to be one of the sweetest people I knew, but recently I've been slacking in the whole goodness department.
Well, today we're gonna fix it.
From this moment forth I'm gonna do so many good deeds, I'll have the purest heart in Gravity Falls!
That, that bird is fine.
Alright, Mabel, it's time to strengthen your heart.
Boom! A thousand good deeds.
When that unicorn scans my heart, she's gonna say I'm absolutely, one hundred percent, bona fide-
Booyah! Wait, what?
Please, tell me what I'm doing wrong!
It's not about the hair anymore, guys.
It's about me.
Being kind and sweet is what makes me who I am.
If I'm not a good person, who am I?
I'm not leaving this spot until I think of a deed that makes me as good as Celestabellebethabelle.
Just leave me be.
Good deeds.
Good deeds.
Aww that's not good enough!
Come on, Mabel, you can do better than that!
No wait!
Stop!
But this is wrong, guys!
You don't understand!
I just want to be good like you!
Wait, scam?
All this time.
All this time I thought I was a bad person.
But you're even worse than I am!
Did someone say unicorn hair?
That would have been perfect.
Either way we got some unicorn hair!
Is it okay?
Thanks, Grunkle Ford, but today I learned that morality is relative.
Thanks for letting me bring Candy and Grenda along for our road trip, Grunkle Stan.
I already went to the trouble of packing all your stuff.
Even the stuff you kept in that secret box under the bed.
Whoa.
What the...
Ugh, what's that?
Bro, I thought you were finally past all this.
Two words, Dipper. Move. On.
I'm going in, girls.
Waaah.
This is so weird!
Probably.
Okay, it's time for...
Do you, like someone?
Ready, Grenda? Three. Two. One. 
Candy.
Candy!
All my life dreams are coming true right now.
My brother.
My best friend.
Don't even worry about that, Can-Can.
Mabel's got a plan.
Mabel's got a plan.
Is it a walk in the world's biggest park?
Question.
The back seat makes me car sick.
Can I sit up front today?
Whooo!
Change up!
I can't believe this is happening.
A real date!
I wonder what they'll name the baby.
You would make such a good mother.
Betrayer!
Yeah, sing it, Candy!
Haha, yes!
Nah, I'm sure Soos will take care of it.
Where is Soos, anyway?
Mornin', Dipper, guess who!
That's right.
And I'm here to deliver you an upside-downington-tastic message!
Um, kinda, actually.
It's that we are exactly one week away from our 13th birthday!
Finally!
I can stop reading preteen magazines and start reading post-preteen magazines.
And just one more year until high school.
High school, Dipper!
Where girls become women and they teach us stuff about...
You know what.
Oh yeah, baby!
The future!
What face, Dipper?
Bi bon't bnow bhat bou're balking about.
There's something wrong with both of us.
Alright, party planners.
In one week we become teenagers, and our summer vacation winds to an end.
So we need to throw the greatest party of all time!
I'm talking piñatas with tinier piñatas inside.
I'm talking inviting everyone in town.
Let's see, where do we stand with the gnomes?
But Grunkle Stan, we need some roof to raise.
The gym's a great idea, Soos.
To the high school!
It's okay, Dipper.
You should totally go with Grunkle Ford to save the world or whatever.
We're going to be doing birthday junk all week.
Plus, I packed us walky-talkies.
Here's one for my party mission, and one for your smarty mission.
Whoa, Soos, I thought you said this place was empty.
Wendy, what are you doing here?
Ooh!
You know I'm only a year away from high school myself.
Would you say your experience is more rom-com, or wacky romp?
Why aren't they singing about following their dreams?
TV taught me that high school was like some sort of musical.
Oh, just looking for a place to have my 13th birthday party.
Master Mabel to Dippidy Dog.
We can have our party at the gym, but we gotta talk about high school.
Starting to think it might not be the awesome future we were expecting.
Over.
Dipper?
Come in, come in?
If you think that's good, Boom!
Me and Dipper's 13th birthday jam!
You're gonna be out of town for my birthday?
But at least you can come, right, Candy?
So neither of you are gonna be at my birthday party?
And you won't be able to wish me goodbye at the end of the summer?
I think I need to radio for emotional back-up.
Dipper, please come in.
Our party mission is going down in flames.
Over.
Just can't believe the summer's almost over.
And now that I know how awful high school's going to be, I'm in no hurry to start that train wreck.
But I don't wanna say goodbye to Gravity Falls.
Yeah, at least when I go home I always have Dipper.
Good ol', reliable ol'-
Tell me it's not true, Dipper.
Tell me you were joking.
Ford's apprentice?
Seriously?
Well it's a horrible opportunity for me!
I had the worst day of my life!
When we turn thirteen, the summer ends, and I have to leave everything behind.
You're the only person I can count on and now you're leaving me too!
I don't want it to work.
I just wish summer could last forever.
Only party chocolate can cheer me up now.
Nerd books?
Chewed up pens?
Ugh, wrong backpack.
Not fair.
I just wish summer could last forever.
Sweatertown is not accepting incoming calls right now.
What?
Who said that?
The time travel guy?
What are you doing here?
Yeah, why are you asking?
R-Really?
But how does it work?
Huh.
Maybe Dipper has something like that in his nerd-bag.
Huh.
That's, odd.
This it?
Just a little more summer.
Oh no!
Wait, wait wait!
Soos?
Wendy?
Dipper?
Uh, guys?
But, Dipper!
This isn't a prison!
I made this world!
Well, I sort of woke up here.
It's complicated.
I'm saying this is my home now.
And I don't want to be saved!
No worries, Bubble Bear.
Look, after you said you wouldn't come back home with me at the end of the summer for your apprenticeship, I wanted to hide in my sweater forever.
But then I woke up in a place that gives me exactly what I wanted: an endless summer where I never have to grow up!
Here the sun shines all day, the party never ends, and now that you guys are here, it's finally perfect!
Ugghh.
I figured you might say something like that, Dipper.
That's why I prepared a backup Dipper with a more supportive attitude.
Trust me, you guys are gonna love it here.
This world always knows what you want.
Sometimes even before you do!
Apparently I wanted a chinchilla!
Right again, Mabeland!
I know it sounds too good to be true, but just give this place a chance!
Mabeland knows just what you want and always provides!
You can't argue with the results: people are happy here!
Does it really matter if it's real or not?
For once, stop listening to your head and listen to your heart.
Mabeland has something for everyone!
Even you!
In fact:
Of course not... that's my brother, guys!
There's gotta be another way.
Hey, I didn't make the rules in Mabeland.
Hi, there!
I love your headband!
Shut your mouth, I love your headband!
We're all wearing the same headband!
I'm sorry, Dipper, but I can only speak through my legal team now.
Oh, he's talking about us!
We're not that lovely.
Boom!
A million slap bracelets!
I'm gonna have the best photo ever!
And how d'you like my new pigtaaailllls?
Gum!
You ruined my hair!
Dipper, what do I do?
How many valentines did you get, Dipper?
Uh, objection?
What, come on!
GUILTY!
Uh, pffsh, yeah right.
Uh, LALALALALALA I'M NOT LISTENING!
GUARDS!
The FINGERS!
What?
You have a wig?
Haha!
You're crazy!
You mean it?
You're really coming home with me?
Sincere sibling hug.
Aw, man, I never noticed how bright this place is, ugh!
Have I actually been listening to the same song for an entire week?
Whoa, time to calm you down.
Uh, why isn't this working?
We gotta get out of here!
Everyone get on!
Take us to freedom, Giant Waddles!
Yah!
Alright, guys, are you ready for this?
Sorry, Mabeland.
It's time to burst your BUBBLE!
Ugh.
You all good, everyone good?
Hey, Dipper?
I appreciate what you said back there, but if you want to take Ford's apprenticeship, I won't get in your way.
Man, I went nuts back there.
I mean come on.
The real world can't be that bad, right?
Oh boy.
Where is everyone?
Hello, house.
Hello, porch.
Hello, wads of gum I left stuck to the couch.
Yeah there's like monsters and gnomes, and is Pacifica wearing a potato sack?
Grunkle Stan, how'd this all happen?
Guys, don't you see?
Our friends need us, but we can only save them if we fight back.
This is your most amazing invention yet.
Grunkle Stan, you're looking at those idiots.
Admit it.
This is the best day of the end of the world.
I think we actually have a chance to beat Bill and win back our future.
Is something wrong, Grunkle Stan?
You're acting grunklier than usual.
Guys!
Guys!
Trust me, tomorrow's gonna be great!
I believe in us.
Those weird cow-monsters are delightful!
Coming!
Everybody ready?
Dipper, now!
Ha ha ha.
Good pig.
Everybody!
Maximum power!
ATTACK!
Rescue team, move out!
WOOHOO!
HAHAHA!
I found Great Uncle Ford!
He's golden.
But not in the good way!
Gideon!
What happened to you?
Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?
Don't turn this into a big deal.
Guys, stop it!
Yeah!
Bill makes bad deals!
I know that hurts because I've accidentally done it to myself!
Multiple times!
...and we'll beat him again!
Hey!
Bill!
Come and get us, you pointy jerk!
Like Grunkle Stan always says, when one door closes, choose a nearby wall and bash it in with brute force!
AHHH!
Oh, my gosh!
Grunkle Stan, you did it!
Eheh.
Grunkle Stan?
C-cmon.
It's me.
It's me, Grunkle Stan.
Grunkle Stan, it's me!
Don't you remember?
Even a little?
There's gotta be something we can do to jog his memory.
I know my Grunkle is in there somewhere.
There's gotta be something around here that can help bring him back.
This'll work!
This has to work!
Here's the first day we came to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan.
And here's a macaroni interpretation of my emotions.
Okay.
Okay.
Day two.
Grunkle Stan smells weird but we're starting to bond.
He told us a lot about being a business man in the '80s and seemed happy when we pretended to listen.
He also gave me a grappling hook which everyone is impressed by.
And in more important news, I met some neighborhood hotties.
I can't believe you all got together just to throw a party for us.
If I had only one wish it would be to shrink all of you with the shrink ray and bring you home with us in my pocket.
But since that's impossible...
Is that impossible?
Since that's probably impossible, my only wish is for everyone to sign my scrapbook.
I'll never forget you guys.
Wait.
Now I'll never forget you guys.
Same-y, but different-y.
Pacifica.
Summer's over, Candy.
It's time for us to grow up.
Candy and Grenda, thank you for being my people.
You'll always be my best friends.
Grunkle Stan, thanks for wearing my goodbye sweater.
Guess we've said goodbye to everyone except, Waddles.
I, I don't know how to explain this but, Mom and Dad won't let me bring a pig home to California so, you have to stay here!
Come on.
Come on.
I have to go.
I'm, I'm sorry, Waddles.
We'll miss you too, Grunkle Stan.
Nope.
Let's do it.
Bye!
Bye, everybody!
We'll miss you.
