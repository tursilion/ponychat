[unenthusiastic]
Thanks.
I'd rather see the game.
Ugh!
All of them?
You play?
Wait.
You're Rainbow Dash?
The Wonderbolt?
Whoa, my dad was a great flyer, too.
[unconvinced]
If you say so.
[unimpressed]
A book.
[sarcastic]
Wow.
Thanks?
Can we go to the game now?
Ooh!
[laughs]
Wow!
The players from Ponyville are so good!
This is so great!
Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are the best players out there!
Ugh.
Knowing sportsponies isn't the same as being one.
[to Fluttershy and Pinkie]
What's it like playing in front of all those fans?
What do you mean?
Is it another book?
I don't want to!
You're not a sportspony!
It's not fun playing this game with you!
I wish we didn't even come here.
Well, I don't, and I don't like him.
Why do you like him?
I don't care how many ponies care about him.
They're not gonna make me forget about Dad.
Okay.
That's their ball.
How did you know that?
Huh.
I guess this book's kind of cool after all.
Mom, look what Quibble showed me!
[reading]
When Fluttershy flies higher than the other Pegasus, Pinkie scores ninety-two percent of the time, and it just happened!
I guess that wouldn't be so bad.
