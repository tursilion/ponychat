No, no, no, oh!
Goodness no.
Just a moment, please!
I'm 'in the zone', as it were.
Oh, yes!
Sparkle always does the trick, does it not?
Why, Rarity, you are a talent.
Now, um, how can I help yo?
Oh my stars, darling!
Whatever happened to your coiffure?
Out of my hair?
What about your hair?
No, no, uh-uh.
Too green.
Too yellow.
Too poofy.
Not poofy enough.
Too frilly.
Too, shiny.
Now go on, my dear.
You were telling me where you're from.
Huh?
Canterlot?
Oh, I am so envious!
The glamour, the sophistication!
I have always dreamed of living there!
I can't wait to hear all about it!
We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I...
Emeralds?
What was I thinking?
Let me get you some rubies!
Huh?
She's gone!
She's gone!
Ugh, heavens no!
Just look at it - it's dreadful.
Take that, you ruffian!
My hair!
My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck.
Well, I didn't mean that literally.
I didn't see you there, my apologies.
She is.
Why, of course it is.
How can you be so insensitive?
Oh, just look at him.
Such lovely luminescent scales.
And your expertly coiffed mane.
Your fabulous manicure.
All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
You look smashing.
It's fine, my dear.
Short tails are in this season.
Besides, it'll grow back.
Look!
Oh, thank goodness.
I know!
I'll never part with it again.
What?
Ooh.
So does yours.
[gasp]
Are these what I think they are?
The gala?
I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend.
Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour!
It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him.
Him.
I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, Who is that mysterious mare?
They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville.
Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot.
Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt.
Our courtship would be magnificent.
He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say, Yes!
We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams.
Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can, party, and prevent me from meeting my true love.
How could you?
Hmph.
You?
You want to go to the gala?
But Twilight-
Twilight, it's raining.
Come with me before you catch a cold.
Oh no, it's quite all right.
After all, we are, the best of friends, are we not?
And you know what the best of friends do?
Makeovers!
There.
Oh, you're simply darling.
And you.
Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.
Now you just need a hat.
[laughs]
Oh, who needs him anyway.
This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the Grand Galloping Gala.
And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence.
I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T.
We would be the belles of the ball, you and I.
Everyone would be clamoring for our attention.
All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn.
Ah, and Twilight Sparkle, of course.
Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did.
Allow us to treat you to dinner.
But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
Just one last thing.
Now we're ready.
Messy?
Well, did you see her mane?
Ooo.
I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash.
A griffon, so rare.
Oh, my favorite game.
Can I go first?
Can I have the purple tail?
My, my, my!
What boasting!
Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
Just who does she think she is?
Enough.
Enough, all of you.
I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense.
Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.
Oh, it.
You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways.
A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle.
A unicorn needs to have style.
A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
Quick!
I need a mirror!
Get me a mirror!
What did she do to my hair?
I know she did something terrible to my hair!
Ugh, no.
Green hair!
Not green hair!
Such an awful, awful color!
Why, whatever do you mean, darling?
Most unpleasant.
Mm-hmm.
Well, at least he's not snoring fire.
What are we meant to do about it?
Hmph.
Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
Ewww!
Much better.
Onward!
Good thing I brought my scarf.
I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests.
Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!
Ugh.
That's thirty-five games in a row.
Best of seventy-one?
Almost there.
Eugh.
Blech.
This is why a girl always packs extra accessories.
Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this.
My apologies.
Obviously, this situation just calls for a little pony charm.
Allow me, girls.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have.
And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?
Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off.
Hmm.
Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.
I was this close to getting that diamond.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Darling, you look ridiculous.
Hmm.
Hah!
Perfect.
Somepony has to.
You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.
I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
Oh no!
My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
It's coming down too fast!
Help me!
Oh, no, no, no!
I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?
[laugh]
That doesn't even make any sense.
Does not.
Does not.
Does not.
Does not infinity plus one.
Heh.
What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.
Nor am I.
After you!
Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
Unacceptable.
Hah!
We are most grateful for your invitation.
Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?
It may indeed be a problem.
Uh, goodness.
Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now.
[nervous laugh]
Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night, with Applejack.
Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.
Yes, uh, great.
[nervous laughter]
Silly!
This is called a mud mask.
It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.
Did you hear that, Applejack?
You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?
So do we have an agreement?
Gross!
You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.
Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be.
That's not even a word.
So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?
Never heard of it, but I have a much better one.
It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles!
Oo-oo!
It is a ghost story, they're all made up.
Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered, that's critical, and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top.
And done.
Ta-da!
[laugh]
You could at least say excuse me.
I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
Fine!
Okay.
I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit.
Very.
I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
And I dare you to comb yours just once.
Oh, please.
I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude.
She started it.
Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
They were.
There might still be a little on them.
Eww!
I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right.
Get up.
Ah ah ah!
You'll ruin it.
You have to do it like this.
Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.
Hey!
You did that on purpose.
Get up so I can fix it again.
M-mmm!
You will if you want any blankets.
I will not!
Won't!
Won't!
Won't!
No, it is I who have been trying my best.
No, it was I.
But I, Wait!
Stop!
Don't!
I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.
Cleaning up this mess somepony made.
Who was that again?
Oh, right, that's you.
What was that?
Uh, but I'll get all icky.
Let's do this.
U-ugh.
Oh, I look awful.
Hmph, thanks.
Is it smaller than a saddle?
Are we getting warmer?
Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.
Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.
Are too.
Are too.
Are too.
Now take two steps to your left.
Uh, no, my left.
Sorry.
Just look at those stripes!
So garish!
Then, she lurks by the stores.
She went outside!
Wicked, wicked zebra!
I'm afraid I have to agree.
Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.
And I as well.
Aah!
Or somepony stepped on her!
Pinkie, what are you doing?
Ah, really.
Aah!
You ever hear of personal space?
Oh dear.
Oh, this is so unseemly.
Auuuaah!
Ooh, Ahaha.
Easier said than done.
I look horrible!
Oh my.
That place really does look horrible.
Nice decorations, if you like creepy!
She stole your song?
You saw those terrible things.
Now do you believe us Twilight?
You made me look ridiculous.
And the creepy d‚cor?
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
Mmhmm.
Thank you, Twilight.
Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
Huh?
Me too, oh, they're perfect.
Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
Are you okay?
Aaah!
Eewww.
Aaah!
Gross gross gross!
No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt.
I've got a real problem.
I see we're having the same problem.
If you ask me, it's already a total disaster.
Oh no, if they get inside my store, Everypony for herself!
My outfits!
Go on, shoo!
Get out of here, you naughty!
Naughty!
Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?
Why yes.
When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.
Oh why, thank you most sincerely.
Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
Okay.
Now, uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch.
Now, weave them through there, yes.
Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n, not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to, I don't know, I guess that would do, oh dear.
Spike.
It's just fine.
It's just a little rough around the edges.
Let me lend you a hoof.
Let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this...
Ah, and we need to weave the string...
Oh, Opalescence.
Can't you just picture it?
Moi, stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!
Why, yes!
I did make it myself.
Thank you so much for asking.
Oh, Opal, of course you can help me.
Thank you.
What's that?
You want to help me more?
Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
Careful now.
Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.
Is there something I can help you with?
Oh, no, no, no!
You can't wear this, old thing.
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you.
No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.
Not another word!
I won't take no for an answer.
Let me guess, Applejack.
You don't want a new gown either.
You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!
You absolutely must wear formal attire.
What if I just spruce up your, duds for you a little bit?
Deal!
Hmm, Idea!
I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.
Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!
Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business.
Plus, fun!
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.
Oh, Applejack.
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
That's it.
Keep them closed.
Don't look.
Okay, you can look now!
These are your new outfits.
What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack?
Pretty swanky, are they not?
And Twilight!
I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.
Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it.
Oh, and it turned out beautiful, don't you think?
And I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy.
It just sings spring!
And Pinkie Pie, look!
Pink!
Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
But what's the matter?
Don't you like them?
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
Not to worry, I'll redo them.
I want them to be better than just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Oh, it's no imposition.
Really, I insist.
What have I gotten myself into?
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
Oh, you're just saying that.
Nice?
If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
Like it or love it?
Which is it?
Well, just tell me what you really think.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me!
Well, I think, Well, Ugh...
Streamers?
Streamers it is.
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
Do you not like the color?
Do you not like the shape?
Oh, Opal.
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
Well, I'm, happy that all of you are happy.
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
Hoity Toity?
He's coming here?
To see THESE dresses?
There he is!
Okay.
Relax, Rarity.
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.
What's wrong with the lights?
Oh, yes.
That means the show's starting.
Good.
I'm never coming out!
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony.
I used to be respected.
I made dresses.
Beautiful, beautiful dresses!
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughing stock!
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in, whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!
I'm so pathetic!
Exile, I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing.
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Huh?
Opal?
Opal, how did you get up there?
Hang on, you poor dear!
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?
How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?
What is it?
Like it?
Like it?
No, I don't like it.
I love it!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
Oh, I forgive you.
But my whole career is still ruined!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you!
Oh, thank you so much!
Go on, go on.
Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale.
Didn't you see how nervous she was?
Oh, puh-lease.
I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it.
We've got to find a way to be there for her.
Now go on!
You've got to try!
I will!
For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.
I most certainly am!
Aren't my wings smashing?
Twilight made them for me.
I just adore them!
Why so shocked?
We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
Oooh!
Aaah!
Oh, wait for me!
Why, thank you!
Don't worry, Twilight.
I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.
Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.
Hmm, Yeah, I guess I could see that.
Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash.
What, these old things?
Go ahead, everypony.
Photos are encouraged.
Oh, pfft.
How can you ask me to put away perfection?
Waa-haa-haa!
There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me.
Perhaps I should compete.
I'm going to be a while!
I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute.
Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
Rarity, is ready!
Well, Rainbow Dash?
Shall we?
Good luck, Rainbow Dash.
Just do your best.
I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music.
That rock and roll doesn't really match my wings.
And now for my grand finale.
I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale!
They'll be talking about it for years!
Look upon me, Equestria, for I, am, Rarity!
Uh-oh.
You sure did.
Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash.
You saved my life!
I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my, beautiful wings.
I guess I just lost my head.
And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it.
Can you ever ever forgive me?
Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition.
Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.
I certainly did.
I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.
Where'd I put that?
oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?
No thanks!
Just stand over there.
Where you'll be out of the way.
Ribbon, ribbon!
Where's the ribbon?
Aah!
You've helped me quite enough.
I understand.
It's just that, I need this time to fill this order without any, complications.
Okay, all done.
Now, back to work.
I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.
Oh, what now?
Fluttershy!
Forgive me!
I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
Oh, she looks great!
I just don't understand how you're able to do it!
I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
Ahh!
Did you use, the Stare on her?
Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy.
I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.
No, Sweetie, it's an expression.
It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle.
I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight!
They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning.
See?
I've lined them in a special gold silk.
It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
Well, I, uh, I'll manage.
Hello, uh, girls...
Sweetie Belle!
What have you done?
That was the last of the gold silk!
Oh, now I'll have to make more!
Oh, I hope I can make more.
I'm gonna have to work all night!
Which means, Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled.
I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
No buts this time.
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle.
It's just the way it has to be.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
Have you met my sister and her friends?
A problem is all it would be.
I suppose that's true, and I do have a lot of work to do, I assure you, they're quite a handful.
Well, all right.
Hmmm, Just delivered them.
I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have.
Thanks again.
I really must get back to the shop and clean up.
Girls!
Get your things.
Time to go.
Girls!
Girls!
Time to?
Girls!
Your things!
Girls!
It's time to?
Girls!
Ah, huh, ah, how did you, how did you do that?
Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal.
How about now?
Sweetie Belle!
I told you not to touch my things.
Come back with my supplies!
Perfect!
Coming!
Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique, and magnifique.
Sapphire Shores!
The pony of pop!
You yah, Y-y-you know my name?
Oh my stars.
If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up.
How may I help you, Miss Shores?
How may I help you, Sapphire?
I have just what you need.
Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the piŠce de r‚sistance de la haute couture.
I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.
Really?
Beg pardon?
Spike, a lady is never jealous.
Ladies do not flip out, Spike.
However, I was quite in awe.
Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes.
Oh, aha!
Yes, Spike!
Right there!
Spike!
I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.
Come along, Spike.
We have many jewels to find.
Spike!
You've been very patient today, Spike.
And for that you get the finest reward.
This is from me to you.
Is something wrong, Spike?
Ooo, bring the cart, Spike.
There are more over here.
Spike!
Where are you?
You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
I think we're really going to strike gold this time.
So to speak.
Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today.
And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits.
What's this?
Another jewel.
Oh, Oh, strange.
It's in the trees.
Oooo, Ewww!
Uh, uh, Good day, gentle, uh, fellow.
Uh, I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.
Oh really?
Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry.
I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha.
So, um, you're out hunting for gems as well?
Uh, Spike!
Come on!
Hurry!
Waah!
Spike!
Unhand me this instant, you ruffians.
Stop!
Put me down, you thugs!
You brutes!
Spike!
Ah, dirt!
Aaaaah, Spiiiike!
Oh, woe is me!
Whatever shall I do?
Dirt, dirt!
Get away, dirt!
Make it stop, make it stop!
Filthy, disgusting dirt.
It stings, it burns.
Help!
Oh, somepony save me, save me!
Aah!
Aaaah!
Oh please, Diamond Dogs.
Please let me go.
But whatever do you want from me?
Is that all?
There.
A lovely pocket of jewels are right there.
Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?
What?
But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
Dig?
Ohh, Forgive me, but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony-pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.
I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care.
When was the last time you two had a manicure?
You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!
Good heavens, what is that smell?
Ah, mystery solved.
It's your breath.
Well, since you insist, But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful.
Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane.
And this air is stifling, suffocating.
And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated.
You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks.
Have you never heard of soap?
You could all do with a good round of soap and water.
Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty.
Could I please have some water?
And that's another thing.
I would appreciate if you stopped calling me pony.
I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such.
So you may call me Miss or Rarity or Miss Rarity.
Whining?
I am not whining.
I am complaining.
Do you want to hear whining?
Thiiis iiis whiiining!
Oooh, this harness is too tiiight!
It's going to chafe.
Can't you loosen it?
Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty!
Why didn't you clean it first?
It's gonna leave a staaain!
And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?
But I thought you wanted whiiining!
Anything?
This water is hardly sparkling.
But I suppose it will have to do.
What are you doing?
Hey, you spilled my drink.
Not sooo tiiight!
Did you just call me a, mule?
Mules are ugly.
Are you saying that I too am ugly?
He called me ugly!
An old ugly mule!
And it's true!
Just look at me.
I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...
You're just saying that!
I don't believe you!
You never liked me!
Why, yes.
Hello, girls.
You arrived just in time to assist me.
With those.
Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation.
I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
What did I teach you?
Not if you eat them all, Spike.
So sorry, Fluttershy.
I hate being late for our weekly get-together.
The usual!
But you will not believe what happened to me.
Oh, it's much more than all right.
I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!
She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria.
Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!
She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me.
Somepony with beauty.
Somepony with grace.
Somepony, like you?
Oh, this is such a huge opportunity.
And it would mean so much to me.
Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
Nopony!
Please!
Please!
Please, please, pleeease!
Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!
You are the best friend a pony could ever have!
Isn't it?
Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled.
I think I feel a pimple coming on.
Only one solution!
The usual!
Hm, She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
More light!
It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster.
Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers.
Pinkie Pie!
More feathers!
And sequins!
More sequins!
And more ribbon!
Oh no!
Less ribbon.
More ribbon.
Oh, this hem is completely off.
Pincushion!
Thank you all for helping me.
I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm, I'm just so nervous.
Let me just say, what an honor!
Attitude and pizzazz!
Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle.
I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her.
Really?
Did you hear that?
I am going to shine all over Equestria.
Oh, never.
I knew you'd be perfect.
No, no, no, yes!
That is definitely the one.
Photo Finish is going to love it.
Everypony is going to love it!
Never.
That's just what I was thinking.
Um, give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.
But, but, how are you going to help me shine across Equestria if I don't design something new for these pictures?
Oh, but you must, Fluttershy.
Photo Finish wants to make you a star.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance.
You must do this for me.
You must.
You must!
You must!
It didn't.
Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.
I just vant to be alone right now.
Wow.
Look how popular you are.
I'm so excited for you.
You must be having the best time ever.
Of course!
I can't wait to hear all about the, thing at the place.
I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
Sorry.
You just missed her.
But you're still in luck.
I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs.
Rarity, of course.
My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long.
Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
Of course she did.
She's a big bright shining star!
I wish that star would burn out.
I know, I know.
And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just, jealous!
Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way.
Please, please, pleasepleaseplease!
Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.
Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
Oh no.
Bravo!
I say bravo!
Such attitude!
Such pizzazz!
She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling!
Bravo!
Fluttershy!
Are you all right?
Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and, Oh, Oh, Fluttershy.
It's so awful.
I wanted them to.
I'm jealous!
I wanted all the attention.
And instead it was going to you.
I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over.
But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?
You do?
Then why did you keep doing it?
And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.
All this time!
I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
Isn't it, though?
Applejack!
Were you reading a bedtime story to, an apple tree?
No fair, Applejack!
You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies.
How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?
Hmph!
You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
It's widdle Rarity who's all saddy-waddy!
Urgh!
For crying out loud in the morning!
Would you all be quiet, now?
I just love their accessories!
I want to speak to the manager!
They took Spike!
Gently, please!
About the trees.
Now if you could?
Don't touch me!
Watch the dress!
Careful, you're gonna spill that on me!
Oh, oh, that looks delicious.
What is it?
Oh, does it stain?
Keep it away from me!
Stay right where you are.
All I want is a clear path to the exit.
Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt!
Stay back!
Back, I say!
Put me down!
Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
Mmm, I know how you feel.
For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine.
I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work.
The costumes just weren't right, and the play opened that night.
I had no idea where my horn was taking me.
But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason.
I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark!
I knew that this was, My destiny!
Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread?
Isn't he simply amazing?
Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
Oh, poor little thing.
And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
Come along, Opal.
Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
This punch is simply divine.
Is this the same recipe you used for your Spring Has Sprung party?
Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree.
Hmm, perhaps you could take a bath.
How do I put this delicately?
You smell like a rotten apple core that's been wrapped in moldy hay and dipped in dragon perspiration.
Ooh!
Love the new hat.
Very modern.
What's the occasion?
The party is this afternoon?
As in, this afternoon this afternoon?
Oh, do they?
And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline.
I have to, wash my hair!
It doesn't?
See?
Dirty!
I have to go!
She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?
Oh, good.
I'd hate for her to ruin everything.
Have you seen her?
Me neither.
Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
Me too!
This is obviously going to be so much better.
See you later!
We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours.
That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.
Aww, he was upset?
Pinkie Pie!
Stop that right now.
It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
Where are the others?
It's getting late.
Whatever shall we do?
Uh, ahem.
Excuse me.
Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?
Heavens no!
We're getting dressed.
I'm sorry, Spike.
Some of us do have standards.
We'll just have to see.
To find!
Hurry, Rarity, Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him, Wait!
Have to play it cool.
Oh, but don't be cold!
I can't lose him, I can't!
He's everything I imagined!
Even better than I imagined.
I am, Rarity.
Oh my, what a lovely rose.
This isn't at all what I imagined.
I waited all my life...
Just give him a chance, Rarity.
His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
Prince Blueblood!
How chivalrous.
Yes.
One certainly would.
Oh, of course it will.
Two apple fritters, please.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
Thank you, Applejack.
At least somepony here has good manners.
You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met!
In fact, the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!
Afraid to get dirty?
Ugh!
Let's go!
Ahem.
I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet.
Or dirty.
Or out from under my umbrella.
Spike, Twilight will come up with something.
Ooh.
You can keep the Elements.
I'll take that case!
I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
See you in the center.
I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport.
Agh.
Oh my, Yes, I like very much...
No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness.
Must, get to the center, to meet, the others.
Mine!
Well, Rarity.
It took forever, but it was worth it.
Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond?
Now to get you home.
What do you mean, boulder?
This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond!
And it's all mine.
Keep your envious little eyes off it!
I found it and it's mine fair and square!
Little help here!
Thanks, Twilight.
But don't get any ideas about my gem!
I know where you live.
HI-YAH!
Try it, punk.
He's mine.
All mine!
Don't touch my gem!
Forget it, Twilight.
I know what you're up to.
The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!
Well, it's not going to work.
Mm-mm.
Careful, Twilight!
You'll ruin his beautiful finish.
Mine!
No, but if you want it, I want it!
MINE!
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from my gem!
Get away!
Let us never speak of this again.
How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?
I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
PINKIE!
You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?
Why me-e-e-e-e-ee...
WHYYYY?
Why?
Why-y?
And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon!
I have searched high, and I have searched low.
Low and high!
High and low!
But I can't find it anywhere!
Anywhe-e-e-e-ere!
How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?
Oh, there it is.
Isn't it always just the last place you look?
Mm-hm!
Yuh-huh.
Hmm, there is one thing.
I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there.
Could you get that for me?
Twilight?
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.
I did.
I totally forgot them.
Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE WORST POSSIBLE THING!
Why, why, why...
Uh, What?
You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
Oh, what a drama queen. Relatively speaking...
Don't look at what?
Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE WORST POSSIBLE THING!
What?
I really mean it this time!
As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!
Oh, Are those sweet, carrot, pancakes I smell?
Mmm, how divine, num num num num.
The aroma, spiced warm apple cider.
Ahh, and, the smell of, smoke, smoke?
Smoke?
Father! Mother!
I, figured.
I didn't know you could burn juice.
Vacation?
Is that this week?
As in 'starting this very instant' this week?
Uurh.
Let me guess: apple sauce?
So, now, when you say 'a week', is that, um, seven whole days?
But I've got such a long to-do list.
Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.
Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.
Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.
Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going.
Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle.
Let me just get things started.
You are!
You, can, put the garnish on the plates.
Okay, now, easy!
It has to be just right!
No need to rush.
That's too slow.
Careful!
Back up!
Looking for perfection here, 
Not, bad.
There are some things I must attend to.
Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
Sweetie Belle!
Am I?
You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater!
Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool, shrinks.
Nng, Well.
Back to work.
I must create.
Huh.
Stay out of trouble, okay?
Please?
Stay out of trouble, okay?
Oh no!
Did you use these gems?
But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires!
I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?
That's not what I meant!
Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
No thank you.
You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly.
Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!
Sweetie Belle!
I'm back!
Sweetie Belle?
My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room!
What did you do?
What did you do?
This wasn't a mess!
It was organized chaos!
I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you?
and you put everything away!
But this was my mess in my house!
And now I have to start from scratch!
Happy?
Happy?
I just need some time alone.
What a ridiculous idea.
A contest at Sweet Apple Acres?
It doesn't sound, very, clean.
Sweetie Belle, watch your tone!
I am still your big sister.
Sweetie Belle, Honestly!
Playing silly little games in the dirt is just, uncouth!
With or without a sister.
Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?
Really?
Have you looked around this place?
I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!
Deal!
Hmph!
Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle.
Oh my.
It's usually a big mess in here.
Id-ee-a!
This is genius!
I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'!
If Sweetie Belle hadn't?
Well, no matter.
She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission.
Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line.
Ooh, my favorite sweater, I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle.
Oh, Opal-wopal!
It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you.
And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right.
Perfect!
Just one more, and this ensemble is fini!
Rrgh, Sweetie Belle!
Where's her silly little arts and crafts project?
Oh, Sweetie Belle!
My one and only sister!
What have I done?
All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!
Woe is me!
I must get her back!
I must!
As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!
Sweetie Belle!
Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you.
Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize.
I am not better off without a sister.
Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear?
What?
But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise!
Listen!
I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche!
Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane.
Won't that be fun?
Uh, yes?
Well, that apology went swimmingly.
Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
But of course I give.
I give lessons.
Reasonable demands.
But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess...
I know what I need to do!
I just hope it isn't too late!
That we did, little sister.
Well, except for the start line.
I did it for us.
You see?
We are apple pie!
Uh, I'll explain later.
For now, I think we deserve a celebration!
The spa, of course.
No, I-I-I'm serious.
Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?
I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork.
Sometimes it's about compromising.
Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences.
But mostly, it's about having fun together.
Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.
A little bit dirty.
A little bit dirty!
A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.
Say you're sorry, Opal.
She's, sorry.
I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it!
Have you seen her costume?
It is to die for!
If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
I made the costumes.
Fabulous if I do say so myself!
Here?
I get to stay here?
Thank you so much, Princess.
No, really.
This is so nice of you.
Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything!
I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
That's perfect.
Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot?
Ahh.
Everything!
I may have been born in Ponyville, but I am a Canterlot pony at heart.
Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle, I simply must make her something to express my gratitude.
Hmm, ooh!
An outfit for her birthday party this weekend!
Perfect!
Don't you just love it here, Opalescence?
Oh, this old thing?
Oh, it's just something I?
Oh, yes, of course, how are you?
Well, yeah, yes, but?
Looked a little country.
Not something you can get in Canterlot.
I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!
I have to get started right away.
This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party.
Fancy Pants!
Oh, goodness, I am so sorry.
I didn't see you there.
I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and?
The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend.
Her birthday is in a few days.
Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.
Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure.
Rarity.
Pro: Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Con: Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit.
Pro: Fancy Pants is the most important pony in Canterlot.
His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here.
Con: Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble.
My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony.
I'd hate to let them down.
And I won't.
Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancy Pants!
Pardon me.
'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time.
She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.
Uh, Why, she's, she's the, the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.
...And then I said, Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!
Oh, I'd love to, but I?
Well, that sounds wonderful, but I?
I'm flattered, really.
It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and, of course I'll be there.
Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence.
Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?
Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
We'd better get going.
I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.
For me?
Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon.
Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust!
The Canterlot garden party!
Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot!
Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday, But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined!
I might never be invited to another high society event again!
It's just too important.
My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because, because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville!
I do hope you understand.
Your friend, Rarity.
But, I will need some help unpacking them.
What do you think?
Too much?
You're right.
Too little.
Ah, garden party, here I come!
What are you?
how did you?
Why are you?
What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?
Wow, First you get me a suite at Canterlot Castle and now this.
I don't know what to say, Twilight.
This?
Uh- well, I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather, Cheers her right up.
Oh, uhh, she's, Hold on a minute.
I am so sorry about this.
She's resting on the bed.
Yes.
You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
Fancy Pants?
Where?
Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations?
Ha-ha.
Mmh, No reason I can't at least make an appearance...
I'm here!
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out.
After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry.
Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table.
If you'll excuse me, I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
I really should go check on Opal...
Is that Princess Celestia?
I need to use the little fillies' room!
Can I get anypony more punch?
I, have to go to do the, thing with the, stuff, you know...
What croquet mallet?
Ooh, that croquet mallet.
I- well I, you know, the truth is, the truth is, I, I, Twilight let me explain!
You must understand!
Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you.
The one and only reason.
Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for.
I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand.
Nothing.
See you girls later!
Oh no!
Yeah.
Fancy Pants!
Come with me!
I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there.
On the other side of the room.
That dress?
Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old?
Yes.
Yes, I do know them.
They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends.
And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.
With pleasure!
Dear Princess Celestia,
I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends.
And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
Hellooo?
Anypony home?
Twilight?
Is that a fire ruby?
Huh, that must be at least twenty carats!
Oh, uh, of course.
I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion...
Did you say, delicious?
Thanks, Twilight.
I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game...
I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike.
I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
Like it?
It's magnificent.
I don't know what to say, this is so thoughtful.
Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!
Thank you so much!
Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes.
I'm going to make one for each of you!
I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced.
Mmm.
Hm, perhaps some more ruffle.
Put me down, you brute!
How rude.
Hey!
I'm?
not some?
sort of common?
fly swatter!
Girls!
My cape!
Oh, be quiet.
You've got nothing to be proud of.
You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends!
Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all.
But this!
This is a crime against fashion!
Oh no.
You are not getting this gemstone!
This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever.
And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!
Oh, what now?
I suppose you'll be eating me or something?
Spike?
You're the rampaging dragon?
Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.
Yes.
It was you who stopped, w-well, you, from destroying Ponyville.
You are my hero, Spikey-wikey!
Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!
Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
Of course not.
All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns.
It's tradition.
Well, no.
We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria.
A lot of ponies will come to watch us.
Hundreds.
Maybe even thousands!
Oh, my hair!
Applejack?
Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?
My hair!
How dare you!
Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing!
H-m-ph!
Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!
I beg your pardon?
I am a princess!
I won't be spoken to that way!
Clover the Clever!
I need you!
Those other tribes are impossible!
I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures.
The unicorns are noble and majestic.
We will no longer consort with the likes of them!
Oh, this is simply taking forever.
My hooves are killing me!
How long have we been walking for?
Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard.
But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?
Stoooooop!
That is what's wrong!
I refuse to get my gown wet.
I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus.
I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level.
On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down.
And do watch the gown, darling.
It's worth more than all of the books in your library.
I've never seen such jewels!
This ruby is dazzling.
This whole land is dazzling.
I'm double dazzled!
In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!
Did not!
All of you riffraff are trespassing in Unicornia!
Unicornia!
That's barbaric.
Clover the Clever?
Throw that brute into the dungeon!
Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?
Please, Commander Hothead.
Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?
Indeed not!
You see this invisible line?
Clover the Clever?
That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us!
Who knows?
there could be jewels inside.
Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!
Give me my rock!
You two deserve this horrible fate.
You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
How ridiculous!
A unicorn never stoops to fighting!
Pegasi are brutes!
Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows.
I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
Moi?
Babysit?
N- Oh nonononononononono!
I'm flattered that you would think about me though.
Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!
Yes, why are you here?
And you are?
Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound, so delightful.
And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
Yes.
Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
That was rude!
What?
Pinkie?
When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!
This is just dreadful.
Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
Of course.
She's dazzling!
And the hospital gowns, they, match the curtains!
Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!
How's our patient doing today?
Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.
Uh, on second thought?
Huh!
Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
Pardon?
Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way.
You've got to stop being such a doormat.
A pushover, darling.
You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us.
Watch and learn.
Hold it right there, Mister small and handsome.
Oh, of course you.
Nopony ever called you handsome before?
Oh, well, they should!
How about flexing some of your muscles for me?
Oh, my heavens!
Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?
See, that's not so hard, is it?
Alright then!
What else is on your list?
So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?
It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away.
Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.
Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself.
You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.
Old Rarity agrees.
Fluttershy!
What are you doing?
That's no way to behave!
No, sweetie, he didn't.
We saw the whole thing.
We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.
What happened to nice Fluttershy?
We want that Fluttershy back.
Now, stop right there!
Let's not let things descend into petty insults!
I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!
Fluttershy, are you in there?
Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.
Shh.
Sweetie, Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I.
You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character.
Yes!
You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.
What a darling little catchphrase.
I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monster?
I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away.
You can afford to come back later.
Do something!
In fact, you didn't change at all!
You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!
What ever should we do, Twilight?
How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?
Yoo-hoo!
Well?
What do you think?
Am I the toast of the trench or what?
Nice is an understatement.
I look fabulous!
Who says camouflage has to be drab?
And 'formidable'.
You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash!
Spike's style is unique.
He doesn't have to look like other dragons.
My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
Yes.
You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
The cutest widdle chubby cheeks!
Ooooo!
Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red.
It is most becoming.
Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?
Yoo-hoo!
Good morning!
An early start?
Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash.
I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!
Oh, uh, quick, do something!
Stop him before it's too late!
I suppose not.
Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!
We're following him, right?
Oh, pish-posh!
This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations.
We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them!
He'll get clobbered!
Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked.
Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons?
Forever?
And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
Ohh, Sweetie Belle...
Was she raised in a barn or something?
Oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity, Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity.
Hello, what's this?
Gum on their bum!
Too rich!
Bleh!
I, I was just?
Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!
It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express.
Could I borrow this to show my friends?
Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums!
Who is she, anyway?
I've never heard of her before.
Is she a new?
Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls?
The best hooficure I've ever had!
We already read that one, Rainbow Dash.
Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.
Oh, lighten up, Twilight, it's nothing but harmless gossip!
Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?
Everypony, please!
She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip.
You're really making too big a deal out of this.
Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor.
So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they deser?
I'll destroy her!
The Drama-Queen Diaries, She's reprinted my diary!
How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?
My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums!
I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight!
Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely?
most evil pony in Equestria!
How could my own sister steal my private diary?
How could my own sister be, Gabby Gums?
Et tu, Gabby Gums?
The gilded pages of your betrayal!
How could you do this to me?
You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read!
Gossip can be a very hurtful thing.
It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag.
You didn't like that much, did you?
What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
MMMM?
Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.
What?
Is it a crime to change one's style now and again?
Why, I think it's a crime not to.
Fine, I'm guilty!
I wear false eyelashes!
Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.
You just made it sound so delectable.
I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.
Terribly sorry.
Ahh!
It is gorgeous out.
Just gorgeous!
I, ah, ooh, oooh!
So let me get this straight.
We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the Royal Guard?
Ooh, ooh, oooh!
I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions.
Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
Now, let's get going!
We've got work to do!
Your highness!
Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion.
Yes, of course.
Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results!
Mmm!
Oh, yes, of course.
Twilight, whatever are you talking about?
Cadance is an absolute gem!
Well, of course she is!
Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
The princess is about to get married.
I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
Told you she was an absolute gem!
Hmm.
I'll see what I can do.
IT'S MINE!
Oof!
Ahaha, And you all made fun of me for packing so many scarves.
It's gorgeous!
Absolutely gorgeous!
There are no words!
guh!
Have you lost your mind?
Look at the magni?
Very funny.
Crystal Ponies?
Hahaha, there are Crystal Ponies?
Um, ahem.
Please continue.
Hm-hm-hmmm.
And when you flip your mane, it simply must create a rainbow of color.
Wouldn't I look just magnificent?
So sparkly!
Oh, me neither.
There are Crystal Ponies?
Huuuuh?
I, just found out they're offering face painting for the little ones.
He, really, loves getting his face painted.
Haha.
Excuse me, pardon me...
I am running out of weaving materials for the traditional crafts booth!
I just made a hat out of three pieces of hay and a drinking straw!
I made it work.
But still!
Oh, of course it isn't.
The real one is?
I was going to say 'being polished' to buy us some more time?
I don't know if they believe you...
Spike?
Spikey-wikey!
Oooh!
I do so wish it was permanent.
Did you see how my mane just absolutely sparkled?
Aww.
As fun as creating this haute couture ensemble that I just finished making?
Delightful, non?
I admit it's perhaps not my finest work, but I?
Calm down?
I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop!
I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches!
Ooh!
You beast!
This shade of brown should only be used for accents!
You proved your point, but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!
Oh, Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville.
Oh, somepony has to help us!
Ugh, this really doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere.
Yes, it's time for us to consider our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.
Even though it provides great power, it also corrupts the user!
If any of us try to leave, Trixie's magical force field will tell her!
I know just the design for a dangerous mission outfit!
Huh?
I despise camping!
All of that, nature.
Oh, all right!
Ooh!
Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'.
Ooh!
Hey!
Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you didn't bring your eyelash curler.
Oh, are we there yet?
Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase.
Don't worry.
Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound.
Ooh!
Ohh, Am I sweating?
I think I'm sweating!
Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister.
It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time!
That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.
That's so sweet, thank you.
Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight.
Good night, Sweetie Belle.
Ugh, if you insist.
It is so on!
She's still at it.
I wouldn't mind a little trip.
Being a Wonderbolt was your dream!
Eugh.
I, had a big lunch!
Breakfast.
A big breakfast.
What was that all about?
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt!
I'd get them to organize my closets, and give me pedicures, and help me with my sewing and?
Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.
How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line?
Mm-hmm.
We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack?
Show us your best damsel in distress move.
Absolutely horrendous!
Okay, this needs some serious work!
Now, first, you must lift your foreleg up to your forehead, like so?
Timberwolf!
We are doomed!
See?
Like that.
Wait, you were actually stuck?
I certainly do!
Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres.
They'll be along.
Maybe it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here.
Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like that?
Huh?
She's really alright with him staying there?
Rainbow Dash is right.
This is Discord we are talking about, girls.
It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up our sleeves.
This evening is sure to be a disaster.
Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.
Not the dress!
Not the dress!
Oh, oh, oh!
Sweet Apple Acres?
Ohh!
Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe, Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it.
And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees.
That's the only way she can get to sleep.
And, um, hmm...
oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you.
Oh, I know.
It's a chilly eighty one point two in here.
Spike, take care of this, would you please?
How did you know about the snow globes?
Didn't Cloudsdale host the Equestria Games one year?
Oh, please!
I think that was perfect.
Oh, my.
This is spectacular.
Please, everypony, stand back!
I need air!
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Ceremonial, headdress?
I suppose, I could give it a shot.
Oh, my!
Working on the hair of royalty on such an auspicious occasion is the opportunity of a lifetime!
I will give it everything I've got!
Besides, the Games Inspector isn't expected for several hours.
I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to, do, this...
Hmmmm, I'm sure to find some shortcuts.
Done.
Oh, I'm so sorry, It's just, oh so complicated.
I can fix it!
Well, I-I was looking for shortcuts and I thought step twelve was optional!
But it's not!
W-What are you doing here?
No, no!
Princess Cadance isn't ready.
Something's gone terribly wrong!
You can't!
You mustn't!
She's in the middle of a delicate conditioning rinse that must go perfectly if there's to be any hope for her hair!
Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine.
Please!
I will bring her back from the brink of tragedy, but you have got to buy me some time!
There's no other way!
Wonderful news, look!
Princess Cadance, better than new!
Terribly sorry, darling.
I'm afraid I'm, I'm not good with the thundery ones.
Whatever do you mean, Twilight?
I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared.
Does my sky look fabulous or what?
Too last season?
Oh my, what a terrible dream I had.
Or, maybe I'm still having it.
Lose the apple farm?
Well we can't let that happen, now can we?
Why, you've become an Alicorn.
I didn't even know that was possible.
Why do you protest so?
You've already given up wearing your crown all the time.
The least you can do is embrace your new title.
You look amazing, darling.
They've really captured your regality.
Oh, don't be so modest.
It's everypony's dream to someday wear a crown and have their coronation ceremony preserved in stained glass for all to see.
It doesn't feel right to us either, darling.
If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot.
And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first.
And you will be with us right after the Celebration.
We already have an appointment on the books to discuss the royal upgrades to your loft decor.
Hmm.
Something strange about the sky.
What in the name of calming chamomile is going on?
Opalescence, darling, I'm so sorry!
I promise I am not doing this on purpose!
It wasn't me, I swear!
Ooh, Sweetie Belle!
If this is some sort of prank you and your little Crusader friends are pulling, I find very little humor in it!
Something very strange is going on, and I for one would appreciate an explanation!
Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz!
Oh, thank goodness!
But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity.
Has Princess Celestia sent you to dispel it posthaste?
Hear, hear!
Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony.
A cragadile!
Run for your lives!
Applejack does make a valid point.
Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return.
Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence.
How are we supposed to get to it?
Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy.
Don't forget about me!
The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you.
How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone?
Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!
I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history!
It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated.
I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them.
Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!
Yes, well, maybe not the most important thing in my entire life, but retro-ancient classical will be all the rage next season, so it's nothing to sneeze at.
But, of course.
Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright.
Just look at all the dirt everywhere!
Ugh, Goodness!
It's practically an artistic treasure trove of ancient good taste!
This one is perfect!
Be a dear, fly up there and lift it off that hook?
Maybe from below?
Oh, my dear, I am so sorry!
That tapestry is far too heavy.
We'll just have to find a smaller one.
Where, pray tell, did you disappear to?
While you were struggling under that fabric, the entire wall spun around!
You must have activated a secret door.
I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.
Absolutely.
We must use the utmost care as we?
I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!
I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear.
I can only imagine how that might feel.
Hmm, I felt something, alive!
Well, tapestries or no, I have had just about enough of secret passages, mysterious presences, and unappreciative castles!
I'm sure we'll find him.
They are perfect!
No castle in its right mind could possibly object to my restoring such exquisite works of art.
I'm right behind you!
Won't, be, a moment!
Now, you look here, castle!
You are very old and very scary!
But your wall art is in an atrocious state!
And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration!
Of all the castles in Equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful!
Oof!
Aah!
Aaaah!
I was only trying to restore ancient art!
She's with me...
Thank you.
What party is that?
I swear, this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory.
You certainly did that, Twilight.
What a splendid idea!
I've never heard of it either.
But the punch is quite tasty.
I hope A.
Yearling's alright!
Incredible!
Thank goodness you're alright!
Or pith helmet, as the case may be.
We're breaking for tea and biscuits!
What's an attack construct?
But you must have them too, Spikey-boo.
Your character is wearing a cape!
She's home.
It's an improvement, darling.
Ooh, I do so love a functional accessory!
We'll just see about that!
How did you?
Calm down, Applejack.
Applejack!
When you go big, you really go big!
I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I believe Applejack has made the better argument.
These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful.
Good choice.
I knew you wouldn't side with those icky bats!
Ew, ew, ew, ewwww!
But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples...
And how do you propose we do that?
Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be okay.
Don't forget, darling, we're all in this together.
Who's there?
Oh, well, there's obviously no need to worry about that shadowy figure overhead, Or maybe there is!
I think I'll just go see how Rainbow Dash is doing...
That's not Fluttershy, That's Flutterbat!
Uh, Fluttershy, sweetness, please come down, and, do stop being a vampire bat.
How did this happen?
That's what I don't understand.
I can't believe we lost her!
Me too, and I was there!
Actually, Spike, I've got one last pile of bags, over there.
Won't you be a dear?
An entire week in the fabulous city of Manehattan!
Plus, all of my very best friends there with me!
I can't begin to tell you how excited I am that you'll all be there with me!
However, Perhaps I can show you...
No, it's?
These are tickets to the hottest musical on Bridleway!
I could.
I do.
Come along, ponies!
I found us a place to stay only a block from the train station in the very heart of this glorious metropolis!
Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings.
That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing.
You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!
Only if you'll accept this gratuity first.
Do keep it all.
I insist!
After you.
Please, take mine.
To think my dresses could soon be displayed on the most glamorous shopping thoroughfare of the most glamorous city in Equestria!
Oh, it would be my dream come true!
Hm, nothing I can think of.
The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months.
Stretchy, but not clingy.
Shimmery, but not showy.
There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon.
Oh, my ribbons and threads.
And the runway ballroom is all the way across town!
If I don't get there, I'm disqualified!
Taaaaxiii!
I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible!
Fashion runway plaza in seven minutes.
Can you make it?
Ta-ta!
Good afternoon, I'm here for Fashion Week!
My dresses!
How could I possibly forget them?
I'm dooooomed!
You're a lifesaver!
I made it!
And with seconds to spare!
Hello, everypony.
Pleased to meet you all.
You must be Prim Hemline, the host of this grand event.
How do you?
Uhhhh, Just, lucky, I guess.
Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out!
Oh, yes, of course, of course!
I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it.
You haven't been back in years!
Oh, good for you, Sur?
Yes, yes.
Well, good luck!
Why, thank you so much!
Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so!
Oh, not at all!
Here, I have loads extra.
Positive!
Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my preparations and I am a bit late as it...
Hello!
I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes!
Oh, why, yes.
It's stretchy, but not clingy.
Shimmery?
You stole my fabric!
I gave you the fabric for accents!
Not for your whole line!
And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?
How could this happen?
And then Suri stole them!
I let one of the other contestants use some of my one-of-a-kind fabric and then she turned it into a wardrobe just like mine, only now it looks like I'm the one copying her!
My generosity has ruined me, I tell you!
Ruined!
This new line is going to be marvelous!
Perhaps even better than the last!
It's daring, it's bold!
Perhaps I still have a chance after all!
Twilight!
Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!
Don't fret.
It'll be here in an hour.
That's not going to be a problem, is it?
I see!
I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me?
By abandoning me in my hour of need?
Oh, oh, oh!
Fine!
Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight!
And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment!
Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames!
Isn't friendship magic?
What's gotten into you?
Oh, go ahead!
See your little show!
Congratu-pony-lations, fillies!
Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town!
Finally!
They're liking it!
I think I may have just won this thing!
Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with, My friends.
They didn't come.
What have I done?
I have to go.
No time to talk.
I have to find my friends!
Oh, no!
Back to Ponyville, I imagine.
Oh, they worked so hard on my behalf!
And I repaid them with unkindness.
What have I done?
Oh, here you are.
I need a moment with Prim Hemline.
I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first for?
There you all are!
I can't believe it, I thought you went back home!
I lost?
You know what?
I don't even care.
I'm just happy you're all still here after how I treated you.
Taking advantage of your friendship the way I did.
How could you ever see past it?
Oh, thank you!
You really are the most wonderful friends a pony could have!
You know, I already arranged to make it up to you this afternoon!
Hope you're all available for an exclusive performance of Hinny of the Hills!
Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets?
Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show!
Well, um, yes, it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while.
But I so wanted you to see this show!
And working for this designer is such a great opportunity!
Sure.
Come on down.
This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week.
With my name on it!
But I thought I lost!
I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with Suri.
How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show?
Manehattan was simply grand.
It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit.
Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends.
Ooh.
Can't wait to see what everypony else is wearing, even though I am absolutely sure they won't be better than the Ponyville uniforms I'm designing for the Equestria Games.
Ponyville could do so much better.
I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!
Too much?
Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz!
Silk slings and a glitter bandage?
Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year.
I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward.
Here's a wrap, in case it gets cold.
The fate of Equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her.
Sounds like a perfect drama-free way to spend the day with Cadance.
I think it sounds delightful.
Now, now, don't you worry about a thing!
We will make sure that nothing, but nothing, interferes with your visit.
Whatever it is...
duuuck!
More like a shade of cerulean, to be precise.
What?
You're right.
We promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit, although I do so wish that anything had turned out to be something else!
Don't even think about it!
They mustn't be disturbed!
Well, I have no trouble saying it.
You got what you deserved!
I don't know how she does it.
Good heavens, Rainbow Dash.
It's your birth-iversary!
Your party sounds simply divine.
I must say I marvel at your superior party planning expertise, Cheese Sandwich.
Oh, I might have a few ideas.
And the theme is, Small Town Chic!
Do you really think so?
Oh, that's such a relief.
But of course, I couldn't possibly do it all on my own.
The festival is in three days!
Oh, that's just perfect!
And now, Twilight, if you and Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show, I can focus on the thing I'm worried about most of all.
Creating a Ponyville Days festival fantastic enough to impress, Trenderhoof!
What?
How can you not know who Trenderhoof is?
Trenderhoof is only the most amazing, handsomest travel writer to have ever traveled or written!
Before Las Pegasus became an Equestria travel destination, he wrote about it!
Before the culinary revolution in Trottingham, he discovered it!
He knows what's going to be hot even before it's tepid!
Oh, Twilight, crush doesn't even begin to describe it.
He's practically divine.
I can't believe he's coming!
Thank you ever so much for joining me, Twilight.
I don't think I could have met Trenderhoof on my own!
Is that him?
Is he here?
Twilight, is he there?
You don't suppose he's decided not to come?
Twilight, I don't see him!
What if he doesn't arrive?
The whole festival will be a disaster!
Twilight, where is he?
Sorry.
Shh!
It's him, it's him, is it him?
Is it him?
It's him, he's here, he's here!
I can't!
Uh, hi?
Hello, Mr Trenderhoof.
I am Rarity, and I have been chosen as pony of ceremonies for the Ponyville Days festival.
And over here will be the climax of the festival, the Ponyville Days gala!
Music, dancing!
And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats.
Exactly!
I, I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me!
And finally, Sweet Apple Acres.
Ponyville's core, heh-heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began.
Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here.
Oh, I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival, but now I see just how special it is au naturel.
Who?
Applejack?
Ahem!
Why are you staring at her like that?
What's the point?
Nothing!
He doesn't like me.
He doesn't like me.
He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair!
Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else?
I mean, what could Applejack possibly have that I don't?
Hmm, Well, that will never do!
What, this old thing?
I am.
But the thought of hauling apples inspired me, and I just couldn't stop myself!
If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples!
Is it me, or could this use a splash of color?
And maybe a wash!
Yes, yes, of course, but Trend obviously has a thing for farm life.
If I can't convince him that I'm just as much of a farm hoof as Applejack, I'll never get him interested in the festival.
And I do appreciate your help ever so much.
I couldn't do a thing without you, Spikey-poo.
Right, so.
Come on! Farm, thing!
Oh, how does Applejack do it?
I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever so much.
Not at all.
Ugh!
I really don't see what the fuss is all about.
I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much.
But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is required.
It's really more of a dance, if you ask me.
Et voila!
Thank you.
Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything.
Why don't you go ask her yourself?
Hmph!
If you've come to apologize, there's really no need.
Let's dispense with the charade, shall we?
And he does!
Despite somepony's best efforts!
Well, maybe it's time Trend met a real country pony.
Oh, I'm sure you'd love that.
Well, I have a new vision for the festival, and it's gonna be more country than the whole Apple family put together!
Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme!
Simple Ways!
Well?
What's so funny?
Fun-nay?
Well of course I'm serious?
Why wouldn't I be?
And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much.
How do you know what I like?
Wail, maybe you don't know me as well as you thank.
I don't know what you're gittin' at!
Be my guest!
Now, if you all will excuse me, I have a hootenanny of a festival to put on.
Now, to be a model in the Simple Ways fashion show, you might think simple means less is more.
Well, that just ain't so.
If you want to be real simple, more is more.
Now, y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that.
Who's our next model for the fashion show?
Who the hay is that?
Is this some kind of joke?
Because you would never wear an ensemble like that.
You like plowing fields and hauling apples?
But you don't!
Fine.
But I got a whole festival to plan, so if you're goin' to start modelin', just get on with it!
You're a trend-setting fashionista?
Why, that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever?
I mean, Good for you.
I, on the other hoof, couldn't care less how I look, long as I get the chores done.
Yes, indeedy-doodle!
Well, my mane is full of dust and split ends.
My hooves are cracked and dry from working in the fields!
I wear droopy drawers!
I love being covered in mud!
Goodness!
Your couture!
Ooh, it's bad.
Will somepony bring me a towel to wipe this repulsive filth from my hooves?
Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry I said all those things.
You're a true friend who probably knows me better than I know myself.
I don't know what I was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit.
Oh, but you were just trying to help me see how silly I was being.
And you were right.
Besides, that gown looks just gorgeous on you.
I wish I hadn't ruined it.
It's magnificent!
Wherever did you get it?
I'll need three gallons of boiling water and one ounce of detergent, stat!
I think what Applejack is trying to say is that there's something unappealing about a pony who'd change themselves so much just to impress somepony else.
If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss.
Not at all.
In fact, I think I know just how you feel.
Not if I can help it!
Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done.
But I learned an important lesson.
Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones.
And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime!
Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet!
Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night!
This simply must be rectified.
You must share that stunning voice at the event!
Pinkie Pie!
Don't be ridiculous!
Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones quintet!
Pardon me?
Well, I think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent, but I understand that you're not comfortable.
Alright, Pony Tones, let's run through that again!
Uh, thank you, Spike, but this is an ensemble.
Now, Pony Tones, I want you all to rest your voices for the remainder of the day.
We'll do a final run-through tomorrow before the big event, alright?
Oh, yes.
It is wonderful when a plan comes together without any sort of drama, isn't it?
Actually, we're the Pony Tones minus one tone.
Big Mac is inconveniently late.
Well, there you are!
Haven't I told you about punctuality?
Nah-ah!
I don't want to hear it!
Big Mac?
Can you please start the song?
Big Mac!
Did you lose your voice?
Whatever did you do to cause this?
A, a turkey call?
You lost your voice doing a, a turkey call?
Now we can't perform tonight!
Well, we cannot perform tonight with only three voices.
It would take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time.
I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I have no remedy for this situation.
Uh, come again?
Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing matter!
We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work!
Without it, the performance will be ruined!
Then what?
Yes, yes!
Your voice became really low, making it sound like...
Zecora, that's fantastic!
Why, you'd even appear on stage!
What if you sang not in front of everypony?
What if Big Mac was onstage, moving his lips while you're behind the curtains singing his part?
It would be just like singing in your house!
Nopony would know it was you!
You must!
For the animals!
Now, do it just like we practiced!
Good evening, citizens of Ponyville!
I want to thank you all for coming out tonight and generously supporting the Ponyville Pet Center!
Thanks to your kindness, pets are finding loving homes, and we're sure to meet our fundraising goal!
So, with no further ado, please welcome the Pony Tones!
Uh, just like a true professional, Fluttershy was backstage making sure everything ran smoothly!
And it was perfect.
Why, thank you!
We'd love to!
When is it?
Next week?
Next month?
Oh, gracious, I'm terribly sorry, but that's much too last minute.
Are you sure you're up for it?
Oh, Mayor, we would love to, but, Would you excuse us for a second, Mayor?
Don't worry, Fluttershy, you don't have to perform again.
Well, then, Mayor?
The Pony Tones will happily perform at your ceremony!
Fluttershy, we must talk to you.
Big Mac's voice is all better!
Now you can bathe in the poison joke antidote and sound like your lovely self again.
Fluttershy, stop!
Ohhh, Would it be okay if Fluttershy sang for you one last time?
Hardly!
Can we please stop running?
I just don't understand why, Fluttershy.
After all, you're the one that wanted the Pony Tones to sing for every silly thing that was requested of us.
Of course I knew!
And, for all her babbling, Pinkie Pie was right about one thing.
When that curtain fell, and everypony saw you singing, you lived your worst nightmare!
Was it really that bad?
Fantastic, because the Pony Tones have been booked for the Apple Family Zap Apple Jam Extraordinaire!
Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there?
I knew it!
But Twilight refused to admit it.
Oh, darling, please!
One can never have too many sequins!
I stand corrected!
I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins.
I'll just take off my jacket.
I suppose this won't do either?
And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?
I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown!
Heh, Or a sash.
At least a sash.
This is simply beautiful!
So much inspiration.
Where's my sketchpad when I need it?
We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes.
Whoa!
Even for you.
She sounds amazing, but won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here?
Oh, it's no use!
I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear!
The big deal is that it will be very difficult to show Maud what a strong fashion presence we have in Ponyville if the most fashion-forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart!
Pinkie Pie tells me you share my love for fashion.
A-and what is the delightful frock you're wearing now saying?
Oh, yes, of course, I, I just meant, the frock is, just...
More like in a pile of pebbles.
Ugh!
I give up!
this is impossible!
Where shall we start?
I've chosen a few fabrics that I think will be stunning with y?
...Of course, if you don't see anything that speaks to you, I would be happy to suggest?
Pinkie Pie didn't tell us you were so funny!
Oh, well, it's just, I believe that is a dishtowel.
B-b-but it does go very well with your complexion.
I'm sure I could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous.
Perhaps I could sew all of these together and make you something you'd like.
Quite...
Well, darling, you see, I feel awful!
Just awful...
Don't you mean inside an enigma?
I can't believe we nearly lost Pinkie Pie to that ridiculous obstacle course.
And the way she smashed that huge rock into dust?
How in Equestria did she do that?
Sorry, darling.
I think we all just thought she'd be a bit more excited about this.
Uh, not quite.
I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi.
Perhaps it needs, appliques. Or sequins.
Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but, this is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever.
After all, Sapphire Shores is the pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week!
Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest!
Barely.
But I work well under pressure.
Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine.
My, you've been so much help to me.
How could I possibly say no?
When do you need them?
But, Sweetie Belle, darling!
I, I'm behind as it is!
I suppose, if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe...
Oh, I'm here, I'm here!
Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves.
It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so.
Indeed.
This marvelous extravagance is the creme de la creme of the entire wardrobe!
But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a, I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'.
Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!
Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle?
Didn't the play go all right?
Oh, dear.
Was something amiss with the dresses I made you?
Oh, so they did like them.
You had me worried, you silly filly.
The, the what now?
Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then...
I thought they were supposed to be good.
I only tried to do what I thought you wanted.
I should probably go talk to her, hm?
Perhaps waiting would be best.
Made them myself.
And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?
I'm sure she'll be along in any moment.
Don't go!
You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors!
I was going to save them 'til the end, but...
Made them myself.
And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?
Oh, no-no-no.
All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea.
I just assisted with the execution.
Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there?
I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them...
But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression...
Ooh, Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details.
What if everything's not perfect enough?
Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness.
You've done your best and left nothing to chance!
All that's needed now is a good night's rest.
And here it is!
The creme de la creme, The piece de resistance, The headdress!
But, but this is impossible!
I, I, I checked and rechecked everything!
This couldn't have happened!
Please, you must believe me!
Always check and recheck!
Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck!
Go away!
You know I don't do that anymore!
Oh, bravo!
Fabulous!
Magnifique!
Actually, I saved the best for last!
And here it is!
Sweetie Belle?
Just a moment!
I would like to know what in the wide, wide realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know now!
Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?
What?
Wait, what is this?
I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.
Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin?
Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you!
But I never did get to see your play.
Any chance I could catch an encore performance?
Awww!
And I am just the pony to help!
I am going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you.
Get ready, Rainbow Dash, for I am going to take you on an historical adventure in fashion!
I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume.
Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ensemble became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric.
Of course, there were fashion hits, and misses.
Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms.
What were ponies thinking?
Just look at us.
Just look at these costumes!
Surely something resonates with your inner Wonderbolt!
We've tried every kind of studying.
My way, your way, Noooooo!
Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare!
You said it.
The Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange is simply divine.
You can get anything you want here!
Did you say vintage?
Why, old and rare items are so in style right now!
I'm hoping to get a vintage item as well.
I just hope I brought enough to trade.
Pool?
She'll definitely be able to get it!
Who could say no to exchanging a single object for such a huge assortment of items?
Oh, yes!
That is absolutely brilliant!
I'm so glad I have a friend like you, Applejack.
Then let's go shopping!
Oh, Applejack, I am so glad I found you.
So, where is this valuable vintage item you want to trade everything we have for?
Where?
But, that's a dented old pie tin.
I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling, because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that.
Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch.
It's one of a kind!
Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine!
Oh, don't be silly, of course I would!
That one, of course.
Am I?
How can you tell?
I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!
Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better friend.
You take our trade goods and get what you want.
How dare you let me get what I want.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
You are going to get what you want!
No, you are!
Well!
I am way too generous to let you out-friend me like that!
I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it.
It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get.
Ohhh!
Just because the attendees are young, doesn't mean they don't deserve my very best creative work.
Why, this puppet theater is going to be the talk of the Foal and Filly Fair!
But I couldn't have done it without the help of one of my dearest and most supportive friends!
You are my favorite dragon.
The hours have been long, the work taxing beyond compare, but it will all be worth it when we hear those three little words!
Awful?
This is terrible, simply terrible!
I suppose I could...
Oh, forget it, Spike.
I'd never have something finished in time!
I wanted to leave my creative mark on the fair, and I failed, miserably!
And that makes me miserable!
Leave me be!
Can't you see how distraught, disappointed, and downtrodden I still am?
Unless it's another carton of vanilla oat swirl or word that the festival has been cancelled, I don't think I'm interested.
Spike, precious scales, I already have magic.
I suppose it's worth a try.
From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action.
Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction, projecting forth whatever beauty you see.
Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.
Hm, there's only one way to find out.
Oh, my!
I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have!
Dear, dear Spike!
Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors!
Come!
We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined!
Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined.
Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking!
A good designer never reveals her tricks.
Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me!
Oh, yes, of course.
I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well!
Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer, You don't mind, do you, Spike?
Spike, I'm so glad you're here!
Oh, I've never been better!
This book you've given me is amazing!
Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating!
I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons!
But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'?
Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease!
You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer?
No time for breakfast!
I want to get started right away!
Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about!
Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair!
Isn't it gorgeous?
Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling.
Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones!
We shouldn't even tell anypony that it's me who's behind all the fabulous changes I'll be making!
Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share?
You, me, and the book, of course.
My marvelous, marvelous book!
Promise me you won't say a word to anypony?
I knew I could count on you, Spike.
And I also know just what I want to do next!
I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her!
Cloud-busting with style!
Moving on!
Isn't it gorgeous?
Go on.
Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design?
What matters is what you think, Spike.
And you love it.
Don't you?
It is, isn't it?
Ooh!
Oh, adorable!
But it could use a touch of class, don't you think?
This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme.
Let's do something about that, shall we?
You're right, Spike!
There's so much to do elsewhere!
Just one more little thing before we go...
Why, this party is certain to make the society page now.
Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?
I am simply buzzing with ideas.
Simply buzzing!
Don't be silly!
I'm not going to stop now!
Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision!
Starting with you, Spike!
You look fabulous!
Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend.
Come, there's so much more to do!
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things.
Now, where was I?
Oh yes!
Gold-plated rooftops for everypony!
Spike!
I have just had the most marvelous idea!
My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete.
Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision?
Ooh, I'm thinking we go by chariot!
Or, as everyone will soon be calling them, Rariot!
Why, whatever do you mean?
Gone?
Why, it's right there.
I need my book, Spike!
What have you done with my book?
But, wait, I don't seem to need it anymore, do I?
Yes, yes, I can feel its magic flowing within me now!
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
Oh, the places we'll go, Spike!
Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot!
And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!
What did you say?
Awful?
Ugh, what happened?
I, I think so, though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville.
Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.
Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth.
We're friends, remember?
There are our little superstars!
You were fabulous!
He put things right in time, though.
Oh, dear.
Have you told him?
Hmph!
Yes, and we never hear a peep out of you about your exploits.
Yes, but you get to smile and wave like a princess.
Of course we are.
Now hurry along!
You don't want to risk having that important role diminished because you were tardy for your regal meet-and-greet.
It had to be done or the Tree of Harmony wouldn't have survived.
Indeed.
I simply couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't do something special for the friends who have always been so generous to me!
It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, Twilight, but I'm with Applejack.
What does any of this have to do with the opening of the chest?
Think, Twilight.
When have you completed a difficult magical task, and in doing so encouraged another pony to do the same?
Another visit to the Castle of the Two Sisters, I presume?
We'd be more than happy to accompany you!
Sweet Celestia!
Are you all seeing what I'm seeing?
I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it.
It's all simply divine!
Very well.
Right.
Let's get down there and find the spa.
It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes.
Or any architectural flourishes.
What in the name of Equestria is that?
Wha?
Ooh, er, perhaps another time, good sir, thank you.
No wonder nopony's wearing anything!
Oh, please, Miss Pie!
This is hardly the time for jokes!
We've come all this way and for what?
We have differing opinions all the time, darling.
Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming little?
Oh, this is horrible!
Yes, it is!
Look at those drapes!
I have no idea if they're tacky or not!
So do I!
And I'm afraid the windows are much too small for escape.
Let's hope they don't convert any of us first.
Even without my cutie mark, I can tell this is beautiful!
I think it's divine.
She spent an entire afternoon rearranging a single gem drawer at the boutique.
An entire afternoon!
You know how much we appreciate all you do for us, and we simply adore having you around, but, we worry you might be, ahem, avoiding something else?
Why in Equestria would you want to avoid such a gorgeous castle?
Oh, is that all?
Why, you simply need to decorate, darling.
Make this space your own!
You can start by letting us do it for you.
We will make this the castle of your dreams while you go to the Ponyville spa for some much needed rest and relaxation.
I'm saying this with love, but, have you looked in a mirror lately?
I've never seen you look this, mmmm...
Yes!
That is absolutely the word I was going to use.
Spike, I'm so glad you're here!
Yes!
You're taking Twilight to the spa!
All together.
My my, Applejack, bringing the outdoors inside, it's, earthy, What a lovely touch!
Are these quilts vintage?
Oh, Spike!
Are you and Twilight done already?
Hmm, I suppose it is a little cluttered.
That bunting is embroidered by hoof!
Don't you move one more paw!
Everypony, stop!
Spike, you've got to get back to that spa and stall her!
Whatever you do, don't let her come home!
Uh, yes, well, uh, maybe you could manage it 'til, sunset-ish?
Ooh, I know!
I simply can't decide.
Not that!
Anything but that!
Oh, but those brighten up the whole room!
They're my favorite accent!
Not them!
They're my favorite too!
Well, the room still looks a little bit cluttered, doesn't it?
Perhaps I'll take down a poster or two.
Only to be helpful, of course!
You're absolutely right, dear.
Allow me to help.
There!
Now nothing is cluttering the castle!
I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset.
If we don't figure this out soon, it's going to look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her!
Can't believe I let go of the portrait...
If it had just been me...
Well, I didn't do anything wrong!
I did exactly what I would do if this were my home!
Where she keeps all her Rainbow Dash trophies?
Oh, and Applejack, remember when we were stuck having a sleepover there?
That turned out to be so much fun!
Of course it will, darling.
I can see it!
You and Fluttershy stay here.
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, you come with me.
We're going shopping!
We'll meet back at the castle.
It took a teensy bit longer than we thought.
So we've made something that celebrates the memories we've made with you since you moved to Ponyville.
We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful old memories would inspire you to make new ones.
I couldn't help myself!
It was just begging for the personal touch!
The poor thing looks so sad!
Just what are we doing to do?
Uh, how can I say this tactfully, You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash.
Whatever did you do that for?
I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!
And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being.
Goodbye, Tank.
Oh, your first Grand Galloping Gala!
The excitement, the anticipation!
I wouldn't miss this for all the jewels in Equestria!
Ahem!
To answer your rather rude question, they're going as our dates, our plus-ones.
Let me in!
That creature took my jewels!
Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever!
They're different, that's all.
Very, different.
Yes!
These are some of my favorite materials.
Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities.
I hope you'll find them, delicious.
Satisfactory, I'd say.
We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie.
She's simply vanished!
I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.
Oh, my!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't get my normal beauty sleep last night...
So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare?
Oh, my!
This is simply divine!
How avant garde!
Forget avant garde!
I should have said en garde!
It was such a pretty little chiffon...
What kind of monster would do this?
Then let's stop it!
I should be able to handle things here.
I hope...
Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens!
Was that the Pony Post?
Oh, it's just you, Opal.
Ohhh, Every other day he's here like clockwork!
Not today!
What could possibly be holding him up?
What?
After that visually descriptive and disturbing endorsement, I'll pass.
I got it!
Oh, I have been holding out for the perfect location, and it finally became available!
So now I can fulfill my dream of opening a boutique in Canterlot!
I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique?
Well, despite my 'nubby scrubby buffy pony pedi, I actually have been working very hard!
However, I never could have gotten the boutique ready for the grand opening without the help of my new manager Sassy Saddles!
I knew I needed a manager for Canterlot Carousel, so when Sassy showed me her resum‚ and I saw that she worked in all of the finest boutiques in Canterlot, I hired her right on the spot!
So I created a collection that beautifully revolves around the royal element of Canterlot!
In every poll Sassy Saddles took, you were the most popular princess!
Coincidentally, one of my gowns is inspired by the window in Canterlot Castle commemorating your coronation!
While I've always prided myself on paying attention to detail, I've taken my latest collection to a whole new level with Rarity's Rules of TLC!
TLC stands for 'Time, Love, and Couture'.
And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture.
But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented!
So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight?
Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot.
Somepony pinch me!
I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique!
Oh, I don't think she meant to.
Yes, I am.
Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready?
Fillies and gentlecolts!
I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you again to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city!
Fashion Plate of Cosmare magazine!
I'm so honored that Cosmare was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique!
Oh, uh, it's called Rarity's Royal Regalia.
My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot.
Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me!
I call it In-spire-ation.
I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown, Water Filly!
Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day, This is Tripping the Light.
And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep.
I call this Over the Moon!
And for our finale, I have something very special.
I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight, I call this The Reign in Stain!
Yes!
But I rather like the?
One hundred orders?
All at one time?
First of all, Sassy Saddles, I would have appreciated getting to name the final gown from my collection myself.
While I see your point, we should have discussed it prior to the grand opening, Sassy.
But, But receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, it's just too much too soon!
Wha, But...
Uh, n-no, Sassy.
Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC.
No, Sassy.
These orders are my responsibility.
All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity!
Is that the customer who ordered this Princess Dress?
Uh, actually, I'd love to see her reaction to this particular dress.
Well, it's just I made some really lovely changes to this dress?
Yes yes I know, but these gems just spoke to me, and?
Hello, and welcome to Canterlot Carousel!
I am so pleased to present to you your?
Well as an artiste, I did take the liberty to change a few minor details.
I, eheh, I saw these gems glistening in the light, and they just spoke to me.
Aren't they lovely?
And so unique!
Uh, no.
No, they're not.
Yes, Y-Yes, of course.
Yes.
Isn't it spectacular?
Canterlot's newest rising star?
One, hundred more, Princess Dresses?
I'm the Cosmare cover pony, I have the most successful shop in Canterlot, I've gotten everything I ever wanted, but I'm miserable!
I don't want to make another hundred Princess Dresses!
What?
Stop!
This is not your boutique!
And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it!
Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale!
I'm closing Canterlot Carousel!
Oh, don't you look lovely?
Nice to see you out here again.
Seems Sassy Saddles isn't rushing to open the door this time.
Welcome to the going-out-of-business sale of Canterlot Carousel.
Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Princess Dress has been discontinued.
But there are plenty of other lovely dresses on sale today.
Certainly.
The dressing area is right back there.
And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on!
Oh, yes, I do.
It's-It's right here.
Hmmm.
Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one.
It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden.
I call it the Fountain of Truth!
Well, then I'll finish it, and the gown shall be yours!
How can I have forgotten?
This is what I've been dreaming about!
Attention, everypony!
Canterlot Carousel will not be closing!
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, so did the Princess Dress.
The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common.
I beg your pardon?
The Rules of Rarity are only to be applied at Canterlot Carousel!
Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville.
Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base.
I would expect nothing less.
Oh, Sassy Saddles, don't you just love my new Femme Mystique Chic line of gowns?
Oh, I modeled them after the adventures of Shadow Spade.
Her stories are always full of mystery and suspense and, best of all, fabulous costumes!
Oh, uh, just making some minor adjustments.
Shadow Spade believes it all comes down to attention to detail.
And so do I.
There!
Now it's perfect.
You heard right.
And Rainbow Dash is here to fly with them.
So exciting!
Oh, don't be so modest.
Out of all the Reserves, you were the one chosen.
Heavens, yes!
A chance to dress up, be charming and show off my newest femme mystique couture?
I wouldn't miss it for all of Equestria.
Ooh, the rhinestones I ordered!
Oh, my.
Oh, there's been a mistake, I ordered dragon-cut stones, and these are hoof-polished.
Of course you don't.
Your job is so difficult.
Honestly, I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight.
Oh, y?
oh yes, and I very much appreciate it.
But if there was any way you could squeeze in one more little delivery, I would be eternally grateful.
Oh, it was nothing.
Nopony minds a compliment.
Now, you simply must help me pick out an outfit for tonight.
Something from the new collection, of course.
Mm, is that Juniper Phoenix I smell?
Oh, mine as well.
It's masculine and yet?
soft with the barest hint of floral notes and?
A gentlepony with fabulous taste in colognes and scarves?
So nice to meet you!
I don't suppose I could keep you company?
Mm, ooh!
Uh, no-no, it's almost impossible to get stains out of silk.
But not to worry.
I've come prepared!
That dinner was absolutely divine.
Thanks for inviting me!
Ooh, you're staying in the east tower?
Those rooms have the best view of Canterlot!
Good night!
Shh!
Let her have this, darling.
Hello there!
Friend or family?
Ooh, you're Spitfire's mum?
But I thought you were sick.
Well, Spitfire got a note from you saying you weren't feeling well, and she went home to take care of you.
That's so strange.
Could somepony have sent Spitfire a fake note?
With me!
Detective Rarity is on the case, and we are going to get to the bottom of this faster than my costume change!
Obviously, I am channeling Shadow Spade through these gorgeous garments, and she would say that the best way to prove that you didn't send the letter is to find out whoever did.
First stop, the scene of the crime!
We had a long road ahead of us, Rainbow Dash and I.
Well, not too long because we didn't have much time, but the point is, I was up for the challenge.
There I was, surveying the crime scene, and looking trŠs chic while doing it.
This must be the envelope for the letter Spitfire got!
Hmm.
These look like hairs from a rainbow mane!
Rainbow Dash was getting antsy, but I had faith I could clear her name and find the real culprit.
Uh, just thinking thoughts.
Rainbow Dash was right.
In order to solve the mystery, we had to be focused.
Driven.
One hundred percent in the?
Ooh!
The damask pattern on these curtains is exquisite!
Oh, and this velvet rope-holder, oh, it's just?
I know, Rainbow, and I'm on this case like a charm on a bracelet!
Here's what I'm thinking: somepony had to bring Spitfire that letter, which means somepony must have seen them!
I just have a few questions for you, and I'm sure once we get some things cleared up, we'll?
The waters were getting choppy.
Rainbow Dash's tactics were, well, horrid.
It was time for another approach.
Perhaps I should take it from here!
You castle guards have such a difficult job.
I'm guessing that at times it can be rather, boring.
And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work.
I'm not saying you did, but if you took a break, you more than deserved it.
What kind of cake was it?
Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate?
Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes?
Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods.
But I knew what I was doing.
Oh, oh, oh.
Did I say that one out loud?
Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
There's only one bakery in Canterlot that makes a chocolate cherry cake with custard filling and buttercream frosting rosettes and that's, Cinnamon Chai's Tea and Cake Shop!
I've heard you have the best chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!
Oh, no.
But somepony's already bought it!
Who was the lucky pony?
Why?
Because it was somepony famous?
If there's anything else you can remember, dish.
That's terrible!
What color was the scarf?
You don't say!
Rainbow, don't panic.
I need you to trust me.
No, you're not!
Come on!
Rainbow Dash was obviously upset, but I had all my ducks in a row.
Except one.
She was not going to like it, but there was only one way to find out if my suspicions were correct.
I have found the culprit!
Somepony sent Spitfire away and framed Rainbow Dash for it.
And that pony was none other than, Wind Rider!
All the evidence points to him!
Let me explain.
I never believed you would send Spitfire away.
When we found the rainbow hairs in Spitfire's room, I could tell they didn't fall out.
They, were cut!
Nopony loses hair in a chunk.
And look at the ends.
It's a straight line!
They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it!
Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope.
Juniper Phoenix, Wind Rider's cologne of choice!
Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them!
Perhaps after they dropped off the fake letter?
Precisely why I questioned the castle guards!
They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night, except for a small window of time when somepony brought them cake.
A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice!
Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot!
And why is that?
Is it to hide the chocolate stain?
Just admit it, you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf!
It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record!
I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record.
He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'.
That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not.
Oh, don't panic.
If I know Rainbow Dash, she'll come through.
Well, I didn't want to get your hopes up until I was sure, and I couldn't be sure until I saw that chocolate stain.
Actually, you're quite a good friend.
You went to get Spitfire, even though it meant you couldn't fly today.
So my friend got her moment in the sun.
Or the center of an aerial flower, as the case may be.
And as for me?
I got a chance to show off my Femme Mystique Chic collection!
Oh, did I say that out loud?
Twilight!
Twilight!
Ooh, Twilight, darling!
Oh, thank goodness!
It seems that my?
Manehattan!
We've been called to Manehattan!
Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit!
And now I return, with a purpose!
We're off to solve a friendship problem in one of the busiest and most vibrant cities in all of Equestria!
Isn't this exciting?
Pff.
Kch.
More like three times!
Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District, it's also home to the Fashion District!
Hmm.
Shame you weren't called as well, though, darling.
You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit.
I just remembered something!
The Sisterhooves Social!
Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!
Darling, are you all right?
Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now.
No moseying.
You've gotta walk with speed and confidence!
Yoo-hoo!
There!
That hat clashes with your mane, not to mention it's far too large and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision.
Oh, dear, none of these will do.
Oh, Applejack!
What good timing!
Here.
This will do splendidly.
Oh, no-no, please, please, keep it.
I can always make another.
And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here!
Pff.
Kch.
What?
We just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion.
Well, she could've been meeting a friend who would've laughed at her new hat, and then their friendship could've been ruined forever!
And, mmm, it's possible.
I suppose it didn't.
Still, a disaster was averted!
Oh, my!
Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry.
I never meant to?
Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, and might I add, what a lovely establishment you have here!
You're right, Applejack.
The search continues.
Friendship advice!
Anypony looking for friendship advice!
Good grief.
This isn't working.
Oh, try not to worry, Applejack.
The map picked us for a reason.
Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue.
We can't possibly approach every single pony in town until we find out what we're meant to d?
ooh!
Please help us restore our long-lost but beloved tradition, the Midsummer Theater Revival.
There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the Method Mares, as well as games, food, and much, much more.
This event promises to bring our Bronclyn neighbors together and restore our sense of community, but there's so much to do and we need your help.
Huh.
Darling, this is it!
The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!
Don't you see?
This must be why the map called us here!
Oh, and you were so worried!
Applejack and I were specifically summoned here to be of service, and you, my dear friend, are in need of help.
It's no coincidence, darling.
It's fate!
It sounds lovely, darling.
Say no more!
You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof.
Applejack and I will make sure of it!
So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation.
Well?
What do you think?
Oh, not at all, darling.
It's quite lovely.
Well, I could help you with the costumes.
You see, dear?
We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here.
The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle.
Everything is going to be just fine!
Perhaps I spoke too soon...
Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time.
Everything's going to be?
I don't understand.
The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem.
We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us?
Why not Twilight?
I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant!
We'll return to Ponyville as failures!
Why must this be, Applejack?
Why?
Why?
Then what are you suggesting?
Then what are you suggesting?
Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes.
Oh, don't be so modest.
Coco and I were lost.
I understand now!
It all makes perfect sense!
I know why the map called you here.
If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community!
But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference!
Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!
Oh, absolutely, my dear.
Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf!
Stop!
You're making a terrible mistake!
What's all this about a baby?
You did, Ms Pie, just now.
What were you talking about?
It is a bit juvenile for castle d‚cor, but it is very sweet of you.
The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
We're not going to judge you, darling.
What does it say?
Ooh, look at that dress Mayor Mare is wearing in the social report!
Why, it's stunning!
Yes, what is your point?
Did I ever tell you about the night that the mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes?
I just told you, darling.
A mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes.
Fluttershy with us on Nightmare Night?
Why, that's positively the most wonderful news I've heard in ages!
Mummy?
Headless pony?
Vampire fruit bat?
Ugh, definitely no.
You see, Fluttershy, the beauty of Nightmare Night is that you don't have to dress up as something scary.
Ooh!
Yes.
This one will look gorgeous on you.
Period costumes are all the rage this year.
What?
No good?
I never, considered that.
Never fear!
Ooh, now this is a real stunner!
I call it Masquerade!
Just a simple black dress underneath but with this ornately decorated mask!
Yes, but this one has eyeholes.
I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured.
It's your first Nightmare Night out and about, and we do want you to be comfortable.
Oh, sure, dear.
That's, fine.
It's so plain, it's frightening.
Oh, my!
Look at all of you!
My costumes fit you to a T!
That's fine, darling.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Why would I do that?
It was a really good try, darling, but the scares at Nightmare Night are of an entirely different nature.
Oh, no.
We couldn't possibly.
What.
That.
Sound?
Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress.
What is this?
Is it a tunnel?
Where does it lead?
That, was...
Absolutely!
But you've done it.
You found a way that we can all have a fabulous time together.
Twilight!
You've returned from your book sorting sabbatical!
All that organizing has done wonders for your complexion!
Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling.
They're vintage, and they're over there!
I've even included my favorites by former Canterlot designer to the stars Rococo Froufrou!
Him.
Orange you glad!
Oh, Fluttershy, you're a card!
Oh, sorry, darling.
You see, we were at Sweet Apple Acres and, uh, ooh, how to explain...
But you weren't!
And it's already happened!
Ooh, are you suggesting...
Oh, well, first I expressed my displeasure with the design of the menu.
He's right!
The tablecloth was red!
I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus.
Oh, don't worry, darling.
I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of frivolity we had with Discord while you were away.
Another map adventure, perhaps?
Twilight, darling, we simply had a nice time with Discord.
As I recall, we spent much of yesterday afternoon reenacting it for you.
And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it.
You just have to be able to admit that that's what you're feeling so you can let it go.
...Yes, no.
Discord, I think these jokes have run their course.
I completely understand.
We artistes require certain necessities in order to do our best work.
Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura!
Look!
Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!
Oh, I do understand.
Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change.
Trust me.
Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack.
Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them.
Certainly.
Please!
You have to help us!
The castle isn't open for viewings today.
The tapestries all need changing.
Again.
I don't socialize with dragons.
I don't know anypony who would.
I don't know how you know my name, but I am far too busy to entertain some tourist's ridiculous fantasies.
What in Equestria was that?
Well, that's just it, darling.
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure.
The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years.
A lot of their customs are a bit murky.
And a fetching blanket to keep you warm.
But, But, But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed!
I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable!
That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us how.
Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision.
So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure.
Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps.
What do you think, Shining Armor?
I hope Twilight and Pinkie are having better luck with the baby!
So, not only can we not take part in a fabulous ancient ceremony, but we're also about to be frozen solid!
Gotcha!
Or not...
Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight.
Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget?
Yes, yes, Manehattan, the height of sophistication, elegance, culture...
Since my boutique in Canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well.
Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me.
I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop.
And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria!
This city's simply a-ma-zing!
It's just, everything, ever!
Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions!
Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters?
Okay, what's the secret?
You just said 'pssst'.
Maud!
Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD.
And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique!
Oh, of course.
Only if you let go of my leg and stand up...
Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud!
Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise...
Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do!
Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store?
That way Maud won't get suspicious!
I'll come with you to distract Maud, so...
Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud.
Oh, what a spectacular view!
You really can see everything from here!
I-It certainly is, cozy, but this simply won't do!
Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind!
Pinkie, put down that crayon!
The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant!
Oh...
A pony could get used to eating at places like this!
...Well, isn't that something!
You know what, Pinkie Pie?
Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order!
Okay, remember the plan.
I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch!
Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie.
And now I know exactly what to order.
So, Maud, that Boulder of yours is such an interesting, ahem, character.
You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet?
Wow.
What a surprisingly suspenseful and compelling story.
I completely get what you see in him now.
Pinkie Pie, you're back!
Oh, your hooves must be sparkling clean!
Garcon!
One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat!
What happened?
Did you get a pouch for Maud?
Tell me everything!
Oh, not to worry, dear!
I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud.
We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore.
We're bound to find something Maud would like.
Maybe even more than a rock pouch!
Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe.
I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?
Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan!
Surely there must be something here that catches your eye.
All right.
You and me, Maud, you and me.
What do you think about, this?
Or this?
Or this?
Or this?
Or this?
Or this?
Or this?
This?
This?
This?
This?
This?
What is it?
You have to tell me!
Was it this bike?
This lamp?
This grappling hook?
What do you like?
Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil, What?
But I, All of this, And she likes a crack?
That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for!
There's nothing she needs or wants!
...and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams?
Because I'm looking at one just like it!
Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask?
Probably?
Oh, you're back!
Darling, I want to get one more picture of you with that astounding fissure in the sidewalk, and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot!
Uh, be a dear and go stand behind it.
Okay, now just, uh, back up a little bit!
Little more!
And now just a little, uh, twenty yards more!
Perfect!
Hold that pose!
I think we found your new holiday card!
So, how did it go?
Tell me, tell me, tell me!
Oh, I am so glad to hear that!
She's going to absolutely love it!
Yup?
That's it?
You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is yup?
But, you're Pinkie Pie.
You're supposed to be all Oh, I'm so excited I bought the rock pouch!
And I know I say excited a lot when I'm actually just kind of excited, but this time I'm really excited about how excited I am about being this excited over the rock pouch!
And then you fire off your party cannon.
Say, where is your cannon?
Did you lose it?
Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?
I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help.
But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is.
You gave away your cannon?
But, but that party cannon is your everything!
You absolutely love that cannon!
How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?
Well, I guess I understand, maybe.
After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you!
And I'm not even a Pie sister!
I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other!
Just open them already!
You're right, that is impressive.
But it's no fissure in the sidewalk.
Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch.
Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it.
I mean, forget I said that!
I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch.
You can remember that part.
Just forget the second part.
You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something up?
Perhaps I should just stop talking now.
Nothing!
Gahhhh, Ooh!
Wow, look how filthy my hooves are!
I really should go wash them!
No, no, stop, stop giving me that look!
I can't take it!
Nnnnn, Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her!
That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch!
Pinkie Pie!
You might want to come over here for a second!
She broke me.
That's amazing!
How did you know where he'd be?
Ooh, I've never seen her like this!
Look at the fire in her eyes!
You'd better do what she says!
Did she just clench her jaw?
I think she clenched her jaw!
Oh, no!
When she clenches her jaw, you know what that means?
Trust me, you do not want to know!
I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave.
Voila!
Welcome to the future home of Rarity For You!
What do you think of the place?
Is this the right location?
Did I pick a good spot?
Wait.
PSSS-D-W-R?
What's that?
Ohhh!
Why, that's the sweetest, Oh, no.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
I know how good you two are at giving gifts!
I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it!
Why, thank you, Pinkie.
The last time I was here, I woke them and ended up with a mane full of bats!
Thanks for being my basket holder, Spike.
What?
Oh, heh, yes, yes, that of course, too.
Oh, for once I wish unicorn magic wasn't so, luminescent!
Spike!
You'll wake the bats!
Turn that off!
Help!
Twilight!
There's something wrong with Spike!
B-B-But the Dragon Lands are full of, dragons!
And they're ghastly creatures!
Oh, oh, not you, of course, Spikey-wikey.
But remember that rotten Garble?
Ooh!
I'm sure I still have the dragon costume we used the last time we snuck into the Dragon Lands!
Hmmm, Well, it may be practical, but this disguise isn't flattering in the slightest!
Ooh, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope that burping dragon wins!
What do you mean you have to win the Gauntlet?
You can do it, Spike!
Only saving your ungrateful scales!
Pssst!
Spike!
Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with Ember?
You don't know her too well.
Oh, that looks scary!
I mean, you can do it!
Oh, you made it!
Oh, we were so worried!
Oh, thanks, Spike!
Oh, you're better off.
She was only looking out for herself.
She's just like all the other dragons.
We have to do something!
And I gained tons of ideas for a new line of camouflage clothing!
I think I'll call it Camo-Maud!
The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant.
First impressions count a great deal, you know.
Well, everypony deserves a second chance.
Ooh!
Now, I have a top-notch idea.
I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath.
Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling!
Three weeks.
Well then, how about a hat from the, clearance bin?
Oh, yes, we must know every detail!
So what do you do now, Dashie?
Oh, no.
Something is wrong.
What happened, darling?
Mmm-hmm!
What you need is to find a positive way to stand out.
As soon as you're known for something else, that nasty old nickname will be forgotten.
Excellent point.
It's simply dreadful that she's had such a rough start after finally achieving her dream.
Does, Does that mean practice went well yesterday?
Oh, don't worry, Fluttershy.
Nothing would keep Pinkie Pie from missing this!
Snowdash!
Why, whatever is the matter, darling?
I don't suppose that pony's name starts with Snow?
What does Snowfall think a better Equestria looks like?
It looks like we've got everything on Snowfall's list right here.
Oh, my.
I was wondering when all of you were going to show up.
Now we can all read the review together!
No, no, darling.
Please, no spoilers.
No spoilers!
Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of you contributed to the successful opening of Rarity For You?
Many a pony has tried their hoof at joining the ranks of the elite fashion trendsetters currently ensconced in the boutiques of Manehattan's famed Saddle Row.
Some might say it's the ultimate achievement in Equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter been granted such unfettered behind-the-scenes access until now!
Oh, uh, I sat down with, Rarity and her friends after the opening to get the inside scoop, and what a scoop it was!
Well, I was wondering?
Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria.
I just have two other boutiques: one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one in Canterlot.
Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident.
Welcome to Saddle Row, an entire street lined with the most fashionable boutiques in all of Equestria!
I suppose it didn't make the cut.
Here it is!
Rarity For You!
No need to fret over a mere moderate amount of preparation.
My clothes arrive soon, my sales associate after that, and with a little, dusting, we'll be ready for the grand opening tonight.
Stripes owns the building.
He's a very pleasant landlord.
Although he can be pushy at times.
Okay, all the time.
It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see.
I'm sorry.
I just don't think it's going to be possible.
Oh, uh, welcome aboard.
Golly, what a splendid idea!
Glow-in-the-dark teeth!
What was she thinking?
Aah!
Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste!
But what are they doing here?
No, no, no!
I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique!
Uh, did you hear that?
Heh.
Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs.
I'm sorry.
Could you please ask her to turn it down?
Could you ask her to turn it down, please?
Turn it down, please!
Oh, please!
Ugh!
Foals today listen to their so-called music far too loud.
I realize that makes me sound like an old mare.
But this is business!
Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her.
Aah!
What in the name of Celestia was that?
We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music.
And after I finish designing the window display!
Ahh!
Wait, is this my merchandise shipment from Ponyville?
It's completely disorganized!
Gesundheit!
Oh, Miss Pommel!
I'm so glad to see you!
Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought.
Why not?
Feel better, my sweet.
We'll manage without you, somehow.
And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and disorganized clothes and dance music!
Am I forgetting anything?
What am I going to do?
My dream is doomed!
Doomed, I tell you!
Doomed!
I appreciate the offer, but this is Manehattan.
To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect.
The perfect location!
The perfect clothes!
The perfect opening!
Postpone?
Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season.
If we don't open tonight, it won't be...
Yes.
I know what needs to be done.
I just need more of me!
Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself!
You'd do that?
Fluttershy, you'll handle those, strong-smelling raccoons for me?
This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best.
This is it, my dears.
If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display.
We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about!
Oh, what would I do without you?
Now for the perfect window display.
Hmm.
A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique.
How's it?
Ooh!
Hello?
The door appears to be stuck!
Hmm.
Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste.
Perfect!
What's all this?
I knew I could count on you!
All right, I suppose this is the moment of truth, Rarity For You is now open!
Oh, dear.
I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd.
How will I handle them all?
In the end, Rarity's grand opening was a smashing success!
True, it got off to a rocky start, but somehow this rag-tag group of ne'er-do-wells...
Oh, heavens, I think he means you.
ame together and created the perfect boutique.
A vision of Rarity combined with the expertise of her friends!
This reporter, for one, is a believer.
Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems?
Ne'er-do-wells or not, I know I can always count on all of you.
And nothing could be more perfect than that.
Oh, dear.
Is somepony else waiting?
Uh, well, I'm just waiting for Applejack.
It's been so long since we've had a relaxing day at the spa together.
I'm quite certain she'll be along any moment.
Me, too.
Morning, Twilight, Spike.
Good heavens, that's a lot of empty pie plates.
Applejack, actually.
Although, I'm quite sure she'll be too busy once again.
Oh, nothing.
It's just that Applejack and I haven't had one of our spa days in ages.
Darling, I have been trying for moons!
But Applejack is so busy these days, it's next to impossible.
I don't suppose those pies are the last chore on the schedule for today?
Please, Applejack, let's not kid ourselves!
Oooh!
An hour of spa perfection?
I can work with that!
A steam is just the start.
I know exactly what we'll do, and an hour will be perfect.
Now, Applejack, if we are really to enjoy this time together, you simply must give yourself over to the idea that you are off-duty and try to relax.
Exactly.
Now kindly step this way.
Relaxation awaits.
[gasps]
Rainbow Dash!
What are you doing here?
[laughs]
Indeed.
Although, if they couldn't fit Dashie in, I wonder just how far behind things are running.
Obviously, we're on a very tight schedule.
[gasps]
Well, maybe not everypony is waiting for the steam room.
Well, the solution is obvious.
We'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else.
But, but, it'll take most of our hour just to get through this line!
Well, I wish I could say the same.
Apparently, Applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour.
Applejack, where are you going?
Ooh, Applejack, honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure?
We're going to run out of time.
The laundry room, of course.
And at this point, I'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss!
Wonderful.
Now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our, significantly less than an hour of relaxation.
Ahh!
It sounds lovely, Applejack, but, unfortunately, you spent so much time fixing the steam room, we don't have any time left to use it.
Honestly, how in Equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks?
You obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation.
It's lucky for you Applejack is too stubborn to relax!
Twilight is a very capable pony.
I'm sure she can figure out what to do next.
Of course.
[gasps]
Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off?
Oh, Applejack, honestly!
How could it not?
Twilight, darling!
How in the world did you end up there?
Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes.
As it turns out, the Ponyville Day Spa had a few problems with their steam room, and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them.
Um, Are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs?
Hmmm, Maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all.
Well, there's only one way to find out!
Mm-hmm!
And I suppose if it weren't for our unsuccessful time at the spa, none of us would've realized it.
Oh, please.
I could plan a week's worth of treatments!
You certainly are!
[giggles]
Don't worry, Rainbow Dash.
We were just heading in for some pampering ourselves.
You could always join us.
These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors.
Do you think you can handle that?
You get started while Fluttershy and I head to the store for more supplies.
Ta-ta!
Oh, darling, dyeing fabric is the simplest thing!
You just dip cloth in a bo?
Zephyr, I asked you to do this job!
Not to pawn it off on innocent woodland creatures!
Zephyr, this is just unacceptable!
Ugghh!
Well, maybe not too far away.
An adventure somewhere that has modern conveniences would be preferable.
[gasps]
Canterlot!
This is wonderful!
I can check the boutique!
Perhaps there'll be some social events that we can attend!
[gasps]
I'll have to pack extra outfits!
What will I wear?
[sighs]
Now then, as far as finding a friendship problem, I suggest we start at the castle and begin to question the proper?
Well, this is a team effort, so if you feel we should go with the flow, then with the flow we shall go.
But where's the flow saying we should go?
Take your pick.
Culture, couture, cuisine!
Oh, my.
Well, it sounds like your stomach is saying we should flow towards some lunch?
I know just where to go.
Restaurant Row, the absolute best place for fine dining in all of Equestria!
Any establishments that have this, the three-hoof rating.
Why, Zesty Gourmand, the Queen of Cuisine.
When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority in Canterlot and thus all Equestria.
She judges a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation.
Without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive.
Zesty grew up around fine dining, and everypony hangs on her every word when it comes to cuisine.
[gasps]
Oh, my!
Such presentation.
Yes.
Very nice, Ugh!
Very well.
The Tasty Treat.
It's very, rustic.
It looks like it hasn't even been rated.
Are we sure they're open?
We're actually in a bit of a hur?
Oh, me?
Oh, I'm fine.
Thank you.
No rating.
Um, Pinkie, perhaps we should excuse ourselves.
Ooh!
These two?
Oh, I don't know, darling.
The food is excellent, but I'm not sure there's much you and I can do to help them.
That's it!
The flow has led us here!
This is our mission!
We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant!
I can get Zesty Gourmand here!
I've done it!
It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food!
Ah, yes.
Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge.
The only time she could make herself available is tonight.
Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation, and she has very specific tastes.
If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work that needs to get done.
Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu.
We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan.
Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival?
You and Saffron can try and drum up some business.
Coriander, I understand your trepidation.
But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row!
[sighs]
This is going to be exactly what Zesty is looking for!
I know.
Isn't it perfect?
Zesty is sure to love it.
[short laugh]
We want to help our friends by getting them three hooves.
That will only happen if this is like every other restaurant.
Oh, pff.
Kch.
We helped save the restaurant.
Now, where are the other guests?
How many other ponies are coming?
Just two?
I thought you said you could pack the place with ponies no matter what!
[gasps]
[gasps]
Zesty Gourmand!
Everypony, places!
No-no-n-n-no, but that's not what Zesty wants!
Zesty will hate it!
You are going to ruin this for them!
Zesty!
Please wait!
Allow me to explain!
I don't know that there are words to adequately express how truly sorry we are.
Oh, my!
This is truly delightful!
You know what?
Who cares what some stuffy unicorn thinks of the food here?
It's exquisite.
And you don't need three silly hooves in your window to prove it.
You just need ponies in here to give it a chance!
Ponies that will tell everypony else in Canterlot that The Tasty Treat has the best food in the city!
Ohhhh, yes, they will.
Pinkie, we are the perfect team for this!
We were just doing the wrong jobs!
I will go out and bring the crowd!
You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in!
You two?
You are going to cook!
Make whatever you want, and make a lot of it!
I intend to bring a crowd!
Would the owner of one of the premier boutiques in Canterlot put a stamp of approval on something that wasn't fabulous?
It's almost time!
Is everypony ready for the grand re-re-opening?
No, we can't, and neither can you!
Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think!
Zesty, you have very, specific...
Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right.
But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same!
Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food?
Ignoring a unique and fresh establishment such as this could do serious damage to your social standing.
[gasps]
The Applewood Derby?
Of course I'll help!
Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!
I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down!
But I came in second.
Second!
But I learned a valuable lesson.
I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big!
They want bold!
Chop chop!
Everypony out!
We've got work to do!
This will take all of my considerable skills, but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!
Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples.
We're doing big, we're doing bold!
Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!
Yes, that's what I said, my hooves.
Darling, I hope you're ready to get an early start tomorrow!
And my cart wins most creative!
Yes, that's what we said, darling.
Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, the fringe is not exactly big!
And that yellow is the least bold color I can imagine!
Sweetie Belle, precious face, old-timey is just another word for pass‚.
Remember, big and bold!
I do have a reputation to uphold!
It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now?
Ponies might stop buying my couture!
Yes, of course we are, darling.
In fact, we just finished.
Voila!
I know.
You're speechless.
Well, if that isn't big and bold, I don't know what is!
Isn't it wonderful?
You, too, Sweetie Belle.
There's only one seat left aboard this creative masterpiece, and it's just for you.
Woo-hoo!
[chuckles]
Darling, do these look like usual carts to you?
My beautiful swan cart is an ugly duckling!
Mmmh, Yes, well, I suppose we might have gotten a teensy bit carried away...
Oh, I certainly understand that.
But you mustn't think older ponies automatically know best.
You know, darling, I can't believe I'm saying this, but that yellow fringe is rather bold after all.
I think I have an idea.
Ahhh!
Much better!
Honestly, I'm not sure why we wanted to race those carts in the first place.
Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny.
Everypony has things they like and things they don't.
Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all.
I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform.
Huh.
You asked for it.
Hmm.
I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there.
We don't.
If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming.
There's more uniforms where that one came from!
Rainbow Dash!
Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?
Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh, quit it!
You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack.
Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?
Of course it's quiet.
Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh.
Of course.
They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.
Oh, of course not.
I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work.
And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over.
Unless anypony wants a cookie...
There is certainly no call for that!
There's plenty for everypony.
Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else.
Wh-wh-what, What's happening?
What are you saying?
That's lovely, darling, except for one thing, We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm...
Just delighting in pranking the prankster.
Or if they'd even enjoy it?
Oh, I don't know that a dusty old library has the proper lighting.
Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer.
But we can't design dresses after you've been baking with Pinkie.
She can be a bit messy.
Whatever you want me to have in my mind, Starlight Glimmer.
Just like this one?
Absolutely.
It will look perfectly divine.
Starlight Glimmer.
I have finished the dress.
Isn't it gorgeous?
You wanted me to make a dress exactly like the one in the book.
I see.
Yes, of course, Starlight Glimmer.
Of course, darling.
Bigger it is.
Oh, yes, this will do nicely.
A much bigger dress!
If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, that would be delightful.
My head is thumping...
Fluttershy, please! Not so loud...
Can we all please argue at a lower volume?
Ah, yes, and I left some lovely fabric out.
I should come and move it to that nice quiet library.
[gasps]
I'm sorry, but my mane wasn't made to support marine life!
Ruined, completely ruined.
Throw it away?
Yes, I agree.
Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip.
Please, darling.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to discuss it.
It's far too painful!
Well, since you dragged it out of me, It all started at the docks.
I knew Applejack and Pinkie Pie wanted to get out of their element, so I thought I would surprise them with an elegant cruise.
I had brought a small bag with just a few key essentials.
All right, ponies!
Prepare yourselves for luxury on the high seas!
I, have no idea what you just said, but your wardrobe is delightfully seaworthy.
Despite Applejack's colorful seafarer attitude, I was still determined to get my friends out of their element by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise.
I made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy.
Oh, Pinkie Pie, that all looks positively delectable.
But you simply must try one of these cucumber sandwiches.
Dig in!
I'm so sorry!
I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers!
Well, hold on, because it gets even worse.
Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with some fun maritime games.
Oh, darling, of course!
Ahem.
Er, Applejack?
Just a thought, but maybe we should steer the ship toward calmer waters.
Perhaps if I took a quick look-see at that map of yours, I could find us a more cruise-friendly path?
Clearly, Pinkie Pie had caught Applejack's sea madness.
Oh, the boat sank.
Obviously.
After all the effort I put in to provide her and Pinkie with the exact luxury cruise they needed to get out of their elements, that is how Applejack thanked me!
[sighs]
Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me.
I am far too emotionally drained to discuss the matter any further!
Well!
I can assure you that that is exactly what happened!
But if you don't believe me, you can ask Pinkie Pie.
I'm quite certain her story will be the same.
Prepare yourselves for a luxury cruise!
A day of opulence, decadence, and extravagance!
Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all look simply, well, simple.
But they're obviously unfit for a luxury cruise.
Now, my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof, Try one, then you'll understand.
Sorry!
Cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago.
[exaggerated posh laugh]
...Oh. You were serious.
Well, that's adorable.
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Luxury cruises never sink.
La-la-la!
Prepare yourselves for the most luxurious boat outing that ever outed a boat!
Oh, darling, that food isn't fit for a pony of proper breeding, darling, and refinement, darling!
Now my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof...
Pinkie, darling, please!
Well, I never!
Hum-ph!
Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime for common ponies.
Doesn't interest me in the least.
Ooh!
Why, this will make a perfect tablecloth for my cheeseboard!
Opalescence delivered your message, Twilight!
What's the emergency?
An apology?
What are you talking about?
Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink!
She stranded us in the middle of the ocean!
[gasps]
Well, Maybe it wasn't the middle of the ocean, On that, at least, we agree.
Well, not that I have any doubts, but it will feel good for everypony to see exactly whose fault it was.
And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?
With cucumber sandwiches?
So that's a...
All right.
Even if our friend the bunyip is responsible for sinking the boat, it still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior!
And I was just trying to give the two of you the elegant cruise I thought you deserved.
That is so sweet.
You must have gone through so much trouble.
Oh, let's never fight again!
But why, darling?
You went back to apologize.
They accepted.
Everypony has moved on.
Welcome back?
What happened?
Oh my.
Let me guess.
The decorations were terrifying!
[inconsiderate laughter]
Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and?
Isn't it called Manehattan Escapes because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?
Yes, yes, woo-hoo.
But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?
Ooh!
Plum or boysenberry?
Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's, well, icky.
Almost there.
We certainly had a good time, but I really was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open.
Anyone?
[gasps]
Maud, darling!
It's lovely to see you again!
Congratulations on your rocktorate.
What are you doing now?
Oh, y?
Right.
[laughs, clears throat]
Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one.
Oh, you're an absolute darling!
This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party.
Do you know how rare this is?
Oh, that's just awful.
You can count on us!
That was exquisite!
Hearing you all mention these experts, I am reminded that I too have the perfect pony to help capture the essence of your vision.
To give it some style, some flair!
[chuckles]
[chuckles]
Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite, Dandy Grandeur.
He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique.
I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you.
Ooooh!
Loving the print on those!
When a client has a vision...
[chuckles]
I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.
That's the spirit!
Oh, I know.
I love it so much, I gave it its own term, Spring-sition!
[laughs]
Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear.
The baby blue sapphires?
They arrived this morning.
And done!
Ooh, thank you.
Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks.
But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered.
Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back?
And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown.
I love this picture.
When was the last time we had that kind of fun together?
[gasps]
Why, I can't remember!
Has it been that long?
I guess I've been so busy running my shop!
[gasps]
Oh, no!
Something, or should I say somepony, is slipping between the cracks!
I miss my Sweetie Belle!
Huh?
And this is when we pretended we were storybook princesses.
And here we pretended we were on a dangerous yet stylish safari.
So many wonderful memories!
Not to put too fine a point on it, but, Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up.
I miss her so much!
I wish I, could, but, between, running, three stores and the spring-sition, I couldn't possibly...
B-B-But, but...
Mm, point taken.
I am going to visit my sister!
We can spend the whole day together!
And we can do all her favorite things!
Oh, Sassy, thank you!
I'm going!
I'm going!
Hang on, sis!
I'm coming!
Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?
Mmmm!
Heh-heh.
So sorry, dear.
You're tiny.
I didn't even see you there!
Tend to get carried away with my entrances!
Ta-da!
[laughs]
I am here to spend the day with you!
I'm so excited, I could practically faint!
You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?
Oh, pfft, of course not.
It's a treehouse!
That would be trŠs gauche!
Client?
Oh, that is so adorable!
Ooh!
You have mints to offer your clients.
[giggles]
How..
professional.
[giggles]
Oh, my!
Look at this wall of satisfied customers!
[gasps]
You girls really have come a long way.
Come on, come on!
You'll never guess what I have planned!
Ooh!
So fun!
[giggles]
It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.
Oh, it's just like old times!
You, me, greasy popcorn.
It's like no time has passed at all.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
It's your favorite part!
Banana peels are so very, very slippery!
[laughs]
It's funny because it's true!
[laughs]
What's the matter, darling?
What?
Since when?
Okay.
We're here!
Ta-da!
[laughs, clears throat]
Aren't you excited to be back here again?
Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?
Oh, pfft!
Stop being so silly!
You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!
And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert!
[giggles, claps twice]
Well, go ahead.
I know you're dying to dig in.
Well?
[gasps]
We can get another sundae!
Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?
A salad?
When did you get so practical?
[gasps]
One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!
I know you must be bored, darling.
This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons.
But just be patient.
We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.
Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now...
Oh nothing, nothing.
Go on.
Sweetie Belle, hurry!
He's making it!
[gasps]
I know just what to do with this!
And pose!
And pose!
Love the camera!
Hate the camera.
Love it again!
Sweetie Belle, you did hate the camera for all these shots!
[sighs]
Let's do it again.
[gasps]
W-What do you mean, no?
Sweetie Belle, what is it?
You've been acting weird all day.
You used to love doing these things with me.
But it is you!
You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!
I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that.
And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things!
I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?
I know her better than anypony!
Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now!
And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!
Aha!
There she is!
[gasps]
Oh, dear.
Really should have changed.
No matter!
I'm going to give her quite the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation.
Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all.
I know so!
Oh, Sweetie Belle.
I heard what you said, and you are so right.
Yes, but about us, too.
The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore.
But it's just, the last time we did all of those things together, I, I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time.
I loved doing those things with you.
It's hard for me to let that go.
Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into.
I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot.
Could we spend it together?
What would a grown pony like you want to do?
Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one!
[giggles]
I don't know how I'm going to finish this.
[giggles]
Oh, thank you so much for helping me with these flyers, Spike.
I'm so lucky you just happened to be walking past the boutique.
[chuckles]
It's a call for submissions.
Fashion contest I'm organizing.
A showcase for aspiring young designers.
Thank you.
I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out.
That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!
I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show.
And, Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.
The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than, Applejack!
...What?
You already said that, darling.
I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice.
But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!
Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork.
Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors.
But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality.
That's where you come in.
Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes.
Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is.
Ask any pony, they'll tell you.
See?
So what do you say?
I do understand your hesitation.
But before you say no, sleep on it?
[squeals]
I just knew you'd come around!
[gasps]
It's wonderful to see you!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Thank you both so much for doing this.
Mwah!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Miss Pommel is showing?
I thought she was still making costumes.
Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!
Oh, uh, this is Applejack.
Another one of the judges.
So funny, Ahem.
Oh, don't worry about it, darling.
Uh, it happens all the time.
Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball.
Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another.
And, that's okay.
Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!
Designers, welcome!
Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show.
Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration.
Next up, meet Starstreak.
Applejack, you've been rather quiet.
What do you think?
Ah, well, that's why you're here.
Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then.
Okay, yes, not a very practical choice.
Fashionable, but not practical.
But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!
You know what?
Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today.
Let's, uh, let them finish their work.
[chuckling nervously, sighs]
Yes, of course...
Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible.
Sure, Hmm.
[sighs]
Much better.
I can meet my goals.
Today is a fresh start.
Good morning, everypony!
Time for final adjustments before the show!
Is everything okay?
Ooh!
Both good choices.
You don't mean that!
Please!
Come back!
Stop everything!
There is no show!
Take it all down!
It is the opposite of okay!
The judges have quit!
The designers have dropped out!
The show is cancelled!
All my good intentions squashed!
And it's all Applejack's fault!
Of course!
But you said fashion is ridiculous!
Come with me!
Hello, Strawberry Sunrise.
This is Applejack.
I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples.
Applejack, why are you so angry?
It's just Strawberry's honest opinion.
What's wrong with that?
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't feel so good, does it?
I appreciate that, Applejack.
That means a lot.
I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show.
B-B-But how?
They were all leaving.
This was all coming down.
Ohhhhh!
Thank you, Applejack.
First up, Lily Lace!
Starstreak!
Inky Rose!
And now, it's time to vote.
I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her.
Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack.
Well, Applejack?
Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there.
And I agree.
I told you your perspective would be beneficial.
Oh, that?
I totally messed that one up!
It's ghastly!
Horrid!
Absolutely terrible!
Pffft!
When you're right, you're right!
What is Yickslurbertfest?
And I shall provide the yaks with Equestria's finest textiles.
They'll be silky and warm with hints of gold to complement their horns?
Ugh, what is that thing?
Why is it so smelly?
It is called calligraphy, darling.
If you're going to make words, at least make them fabulous.
Ahhh!
Even better than a perfect copy.
Sounds fabulous.
Why, I'm creating a gown, darling!
I don't know!
I'm stress-sewing!
When I overheard those two at the cafe, I suddenly understood why I've been getting cancellations for days!
Because nopony likes me any more!
They're boycotting me!
Right away, pony-who-still-likes-me!
My emotions, darling!
Stress couture!
Hmm?
Oh, uh, sorry, darling.
Force of habit.
Absolutely.
Fads come and go.
Friendship is forever.
I heard that!
[giggles]
I've gotten much better at roughing it, haven't I?
I know what you're thinking.
But I promise, I only brought the essentials.
Of course.
What is life if you can't make it beautiful?
Mm, that's not entirely true.
We have each other.
Why don't we see if it's safe to head back to camp?
There, there, Sweetie Belle.
Not to worry.
Oh, no-no-no-no, no, not true.
There's beauty in everything.
Even these blah rocks aren't really blah.
If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them.
And the way the firelight dances on the cave wall, shadow and light?
Ooh, it's so gorgeous!
Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about my favorite legend?
Her name, was Mistmane.
Yeeees, but did you know she used to be the most beautiful unicorn in all the land?
Well, Mistmane was a very promising young sorceress.
She was as talented as she was beautiful and kind.
Everypony loved her and missed her when she was sent to the finest magic school.
While she was gone, she was delighted to find out that her best friend, Sable Spirit, was crowned empress.
She couldn't wait to return home once she finished her studies.
But once she arrived, she was devastated by what she saw.
But there was no denying what was in front of her.
Sable Spirit took everything that was beautiful away from anypony else!
And Mistmane was sure there had to be some explanation.
So did Mistmane.
She went to confront her friend.
Everypony thought Sable Spirit was defeated, and that was that.
But Mistmane knew there was more she could do to help.
Beauty isn't everything.
But Mistmane knew that it does have the power to make ponies smile.
She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces, including Sable Spirit's.
Sable Spirit was so touched that she vowed to be more like her friend in the ways that mattered.
From then on, she ruled with kindness and compassion.
Even though she gave away her physical beauty, she dedicated her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria.
Any time you go out of your way to brighten somepony's day by doing something like giving them flowers, you're following in the hoofsteps of Mistmane.
We just have to wait until the swarm moves on.
Then we'll think of a way out.
Or not.
And if there's flowing water, then...
Okay, on three.
One, two?
Well, almost.
It is?
What I would do, is pick flowers that accentuate my mane.
It makes for a captivating color story when you present them to whomever they're intended.
Oh, darling, I need a dozen lavender pieces for Photo Finish's shoot on the most beautiful manes in Equestria.
I know you're swamped, but it's for Vanity Mare!
She's going to take pictures of my mane, so color coordination is a must.
Have you a single big one?
If the wind came from one direction, it would really intensify the effect.
Hmm.
I do enjoy the windswept look, but other ponies might need to see it before they feel it.
My mane will be flowing over the chaise in the tableau I have in mind.
But I was hoping to choose the color.
Could you make one in a pale yellow?
I need something across the color wheel from this.
[giggles]
Pinkie?
I need to put Photo Finish in a good mood, and nothing creates a better mood than your confecti?
Ooh.
Am I interrupting?
Congratulations.
Pinkie!
I can't have Photo Finish shoot my mane like this!
And this party string won't come off!
[shuddering sigh]
It'll be fine, Pinkie.
I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow.
Actually, you might consider doing the same.
[gasps]
That's it!
We'll pay a visit to Zecora!
She's a wonder with a cauldron.
I'm sure she can mix up a fix for both of us.
I, think you may still have some baking to do.
I do wish Zecora lived in town.
One shouldn't have to brave the darkest part of the forest for shampoo.
Well, uh, Hmm, I'm not sure that your style is quite right for this particular photo essay.
Photo Finish travelled everywhere in her search for the most beautiful of manes.
Well, yaks don't have manes, per se, and I'm not sure their style is quite what she's looking for either.
Though at this moment, neither is mine.
I'm sure you're right.
Listen, spooky eyes!
Why don't you take a picture?
It will last longer!
On second thought, don't.
Getting my picture taken in this state is what I'm trying to avoid!
Are you certain that's safe?
You really should bake new ones.
Oh-ho, what a relief!
I can't tell you how worried I was that my mane wouldn't be ready for the shoot.
[laughs]
Tell me about it!
Well, I do enjoy a good yarn, but I'm not sure I could take anymore mane fright today.
Uh-huh, hmm, yes, well, very entertaining.
Uh, thanks for the shampoo.
Ta-ta!
A relaxing shower really gives you the chance to focus on the fabulosity of your mane!
[laughs, sniff sniff]
Not the most pleasant scent, but it gets the job done.
My mane feels lighter alrea?
It's important that you know that I am not pointing hooves, but?
Let's just say I understand why your shampoo hasn't made a splash in the marketplace.
Goodness, Zecora!
You could at least pretend it isn't that bad!
Oh, thank goodness!
I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early-onset mare pattern baldness!
Oh, what a relief!
Well, if you could just whip up a cure, I'll be on my way.
So much to do before the shoot tomorrow.
Sorry?
W-w-w-w-w-w-wait, there's, there's a chance?
You think?
There's nothing to worry about.
Zecora will have a cure before I've even finished my to-dos.
But I don't know if I can even show my face looking like this!
Uh, sorry.
I, uh, believe it was my turn, and I-I-I-I just need to pick up some?
Oh, so kind of you to say.
I-I?
N-Non-fabulous?
Oh, thank you, Davenport.
Um, perhaps I can pick it up once everypony leav?
But?
But?
I can't believe how differently ponies treat you when you can't command their attention.
Messed up?
Does this look messed up to you?
Honestly!
How hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?
If today is any indication of how ponies will treat me from now on, I can't simply wait to see if my mane grows back!
Yes, well, even if everypony isn't utterly indifferent to my presence, Zecora might not be able to fix this in time for the shoot.
Can't you do a spell to restore some semblance of my mane?
Tricky!
I know!
I don't care!
Make with the tricks!
This won't do!
I need an actual mane!
More disastrous than this?
B-But Zecora said there was still a chance!
[sighs in relief]
You mean I'll get my fabulous mane back in time for the shoot?
I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for any other areas that are lacking.
But I will need your honest opinions.
[nervous ta-da]
How awful is it?
Oh, come on!
Can't anypony pretend it's not bad?
Well, if any of you have an idea how to make this disaster look good enough for Photo Finish's piece in Vanity Mare on the most beautiful manes in Equestria, I'm open to hearing it!
I don't understand, Applejack.
How is milking a cow going to help?
It's a good idea, Applejack, but Photo Finish is looking for the most beautiful manes, not bonnets.
[gasps]
You know, this is really quite fetching!
...Just not portable.
Oh, let's face it.
I'll just have to call Photo Finish and cancel.
Come in.
Would you mind closing the door?
I'm more comfortable in the dark.
[sighs]
It's lovely of you to say, but it's hard to argue with cold, hard facts.
That without my mane, I simply can't shine as I once did, and ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony I've become.
Goodness, You're right!
The only pony behaving differently today was me!
Besides, what doesn't shine from the outside in, I'm preparing to shine from the inside out!
I have a solution!
Thank you.
Although I'm afraid I missed my chance at Vanity Mare, which means I have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare.
Mm, The windswept look is very last-season.
Perhaps you could set this up outside.
It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic.
Photoshoot or no, you can always use a chaise!
Oh, pshaw, Applejack.
I'm simply making up for all the time I wasted feeling sorry for myself.
I'm just glad I have all of you to remind me that even if I accidentally use magical remover potion on my mane, I can look good on the outside as long as I feel good on the inside.
[gasps]
Pinkie!
If I had the remover potion this whole time, that means Pinkie must have the, shampoo.
Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the rest of that remover potion.
So you're sure?
You're sure it's fully recovered?
Oh, honestly, Pinkie?
After all I went through, I'm not sure it even matters what mane graces the page?
But I, I cancelled the shoot.
I don't know what to say!
They must have defeated the villain, since Equestria is still full of light and hope.
Perhaps it is time to take a break.
This mystery is over a thousand years old, after all.
Another day or two won't make a difference.
Twilight, darling.
We understand you're excited, but that's all we understand.
Darling, your diorama!
Mistmane's flower!
Perhaps it just seemed like your gardens were worthless.
But a little pruning can work wonders.
Of course you will have to look after more than just one flower now.
Honestly, you two.
Not everything is a competition.
But Mistmane's flower is by far the most attractive of the artifacts.
It sounds like you need a map.
Luckily, we have just the thing.
Did you know he can do that?
Who knew they would become such a popular square dancing destination?
I think you'll find her work is worth reading before you dismiss it out of hoof!
Hmm, that's odd.
The only time the map's called all of us to one place was Starlight's village.
Well, you, I'm not sure.
They simply work for us.
The Elements!
They didn't disappear!
Ugh!
There's that horrid town where we were almost sold!
Perhaps.
But where does one go to learn about friendship?
Ugh, you think so?
I had hoped dressing the part would help me feel the part.
Of course you can, darling.
Ooh!
Students certainly traveled from far and wide to attend our school!
I find that nothing brightens my mood like a new ensemble!
[gasps]
But why?
So, we'd be allowed to teach however we want to?
Pfft!
Nonsense!
I'm certain we can win them over with our charm and style!
ever so sorry about the misunderstanding.
All creatures are, of course, welcome.
We need to think like our students.
If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?
And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!
But this time, we guarantee it shall be different.
Fluttershy!
Oh, the better question would be, What isn't the matter?
Uh, I would love to, darling, but I just don't have the time.
The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show is practically upon us, and the cornerstone piece of my collection just isn't working!
Oh-ho-ho, it's serious.
The entire collection is designed around it!
Yes, well, I don't need help making clothes.
Sassy Saddles is pitching in.
Plus, I'll be pulling all three of my Manehattan assistants.
That's just it, darling.
This is Manehattan's busiest shopping season, and I can't just close the shop.
So I was hoping, you might consider running it?
Well, I may have asked a few others.
Uh, It doesn't matter who else I asked, because I couldn't be happier that you agreed to help!
Oh, darling, it's easy to track.
The store is divided into sections, chic, classic, modern, sophisticated, avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse.
And, of course, each section is divided by season, color, and price.
It's a classic SCP system.
Then it's just a little ringing ponies up, a little fluff and fold, Voila!
But, of course, that's the easy part.
Mm-hmm.
As you well know, the real focus at Rarity For You is on the customer!
Care to give it a try?
If I may, I'm thinking noir-esque minimalist but with a twist.
Perhaps a tapered hem.
Hmm.
The inseams say, Yes!
Oh, darling, come now.
You've conquered your shyness a thousand times over.
You can't let a few fashion ponies undo all that progress.
You simply must access your inner strength and allow it to shine through!
Uh, daily affirmations?
Meditation?
Ooh!
Power posing works wonders whenever I feel intimidated.
Try these.
Confident warrior!
Gold medalist!
Showpony!
Or, not.
Oh, goodness, look at the time!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go!
I'm right behind you!
But, darling, I simply can't.
The fashion show is in Canterlot tomorrow, and I'll be up all night, even with the help of all of my assistants!
Well, not all my assistants.
Ever since you convinced me to let them live in the shop, these beastie sweeties have been nothing but helpful.
Oh, I wish I could stay and offer more help.
[gasps]
Why not try a new outfit?
Think of it as the costume for your role as, Shop Pony!
Ha ha!
You know what they say, clothes make the pony.
You know, them.
All right.
I'm sure you and your furry friends will do just fine.
Ta-ta!
Canterlot fashion show or no, I simply can't leave Fluttershy to fend for herself with these Manehattanites.
Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop.
Potential emergency at the boutique.
Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her.
[laughs]
And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!
Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's still not right!
Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time.
It's up to you!
Go out there and sell it!
Now, attitude!
I don't understand.
When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof.
Wh-wh-wha, Rodents?
Well, why didn't you say that from the start?
She obviously needs help!
Come on!
Bad?
This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!
Whaaat?
That's it!
Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice!
You are terminated!
[sighs]
Well, thankfully I?
You?
you?
you are terminated, too!
Now, I?
Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!
[sighs]
Well, I'm glad that's over?
[sighs]
You think?
Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop.
That's why I wanted a friend to do it.
Indeed.
You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy.
And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!
And last one, There!
The missing piece for my new collection, the Warrior of Inner Strength!
Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off.
What?
No, I?
Oh, as soon as she sees these fabulous costumes, all she'll be able to say is Brava!
Silk!
I must find the silk!
If Celestia's going to be in our play, we have to take everything up to the next level!
None of these old ideas will do!
...Nopony will ever miss it!
[gasps]
It's the perfect substitute!
It was the perfect substitute.
No pony indeed.
But, but, but how?
The audience is about to riot!
We have no backdrop!
And our lead actress is?
Uhhhh, I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike.
He really was an excellent pet.
I can't imagine why you set him free.
Well, they are beautiful.
A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest?
Spike!
What are you doing?
Is there something wrong with your face?
Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable.
But even I get the odd blemish from time to time.
It's nothing to be embarrassed by.
You could pay Zecora a visit.
She makes a cream that works wonders.
Just don't get the shampoo.
Oh, maybe he moved out.
Everypony has to leave the nest at some point.
Perhaps you should pay Zecora a visit sooner rather than later.
Oh, Spike!
My, what a fetching ensemble you put together.
Very noir-esque.
[giggles]
I believe Shadow Spade herself would approve.
But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off.
Sorry, you'll have to speak up.
My ears are a little bit clogged or something.
It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available.
Zecora!
Hello?
Are you there?
Oh, dear!
I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?
Eh, I-I'm sorry?
I can't seem to hear anything!
I was hoping you could help!
I have no idea what happened!
One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!
I only know you're talking 'cause your mouth is going up and down.
[sighs, sniffs, coughs]
Oh, goodness!
I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative.
I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back!
It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!
Oh, thank you.
You're an ear saver.
Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?
Spike is having some scale issues!
I think I heard something!
Your cure is working already!
Thank you, Zecora.
I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!
Oh, Spike.
What are you doing here?
Yes, what?
I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back!
I can't read these instructions!
Does this say two drops once a day or one drop twice a day?
Yes, my ears are completely clogged!
Why, Spike!
Your stone scales look worse!
Oh, here!
I picked up just the thing.
What?
Twilight!
This isn't the first time I've been in the clutches of a horrible giant creature, but it doesn't get any easier!
Yes!
And also, I'm glad you've got wings!
I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect.
[sighs]
Even if the symptoms were slightly unsettling.
And let's face it, the odor wasn't pleasant.
Nopony would stop caring for you just because you were getting older.
Everypony goes through changes, but sometimes change can be wonderful.
Like being able to model for any length of dress!
[giggles]
Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?
Of course, darling.
Flying will also be beneficial for you to help me with gowns, frocks, robes, shifts, skirts, minis, maxis...
I'm going to call you Repeatie Belle!
We've been through this!
Please let me concentrate!
[sighs]
You've more than earned them.
Oh, that's not mine.
Yes, I used to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me.
I'm a simple filly.
Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?
Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz?
Darling, you're not even prepared.
It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.
Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper.
And coming from me, that is saying a lot.
Applejack, darling, are you all right?
You look a little peaky.
And where's your wagon?
Really?
I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!
Starlight!
Please stop running!
W-What in Equestria's going on here?
Wha?
I most certainly did not!
Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag!
I miss my things!
And terribly far away.
In the middle of my friendship quilting class?
I think not!
All of those unfinished seams!
[faints]
A glamour spell on our cutie marks?
It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to you about the friendship lessons he's learning.
Ooh!
The sewing machines I ordered for my class!
These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable.
Oh, don't worry, darling.
I'll think of something.
And I didn't use the school funds to buy these.
I made the purchase entirely with my own bits.
Why waste your time at a friendship school that's just a school?
Learn everything they teach and more at Friendship University?
Oh, pfft!
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
You're the Princess of Friendship.
What could this other school possibly offer?
I think we need to look into this school.
I don't like to judge solely on appearances.
But, what kind of friendship school is this?
We know what it means.
But who would accredit this place?
Well, she did write the book on it.
Uh-oh.
Oh, please.
I think I know a disguise when I see one.
Take off that ridiculous beard, Flam!
Darling, of course not.
Which is why we have to investigate!
Only if we do it as ourselves.
In these disguises, we could pass as students at out own school.
Ah-ah.
What did I say about using our real names?
We sure are.
Completely new.
Now, I've read enough Shadow Spade to know the key to going undercover is rehearsing your backstory.
I'm Plainity and I love bland old normal stuff.
No frills for me.
Okay!
Your turn.
Perfect!
Now, how do we start our investigation?
If by thoughtful you mean generous, I'd say true.
Plainity.
You can be generous with all sorts of things.
Gifts, compliments, your time.
Hey, Eyepatch!
Where's your eye patch?
[gasps]
Was your cover blown?
Were we wearing our eye patch?
But-But-But that's ridiculous!
Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment.
If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive.
Which reminds me.
Can you get a message to Spike?
I want to return those sewing machines.
I need the bits if I'm going to keep advancing here.
Tuition's free, but the worksheets sure aren't.
[laughs]
Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and?
This is the scam, isn't it?
Twilight, maybe I should take over the investigation.
Think of your reputation!
I think not!
Not Plainity, but, Rarity!
We decided to bring somepony else here to listen to everything you just said!
I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.
But of course, darling.
If there's one thing I learned at Friendship University, it is not to give up when you know what's right.
And I know teaching friendship through sewing is right!
I just need to figure out how.
Oh, I'd love to help, but I have to meet Rainbow Dash for our day of fun together.
Ooh!
Your example is here!
[laughs]
Our day of fun was hard to plan, what with Rainbow Dash's extremely time-consuming and erratically scheduled Wonderbolts practice.
Perfect!
We'll go shopping first.
And we know all the same ponies.
Yes!
And I once proved Rainbow Dash's innocence to her beloved Wonderbolts when she was being framed for a mysterious incident.
Hmm?
Sorry, darling.
Wearing this drab jersey gave me an idea for a buckball-inspired line of athleisure wear that would allow for maximum flexibility and style!
Uh, but I'm ready now!
What?
I mean, of course!
Uh, I held my bucket and everything!
Really?
Well, that sounds dangerous.
[sighs]
Finally!
Hmmm, I'm genuinely not sure.
Are they too in style?
Oh, yes, yes.
But they should be ahead of the curve.
If they're in fashion right now, then they're practically already out.
Hmmm, Perhaps I should get the stilettos instead.
What do you think?
Au contraire.
They're perfect in a multitude of situations.
Formal functions, afternoon teas, evening teas, high tea, tea by the sea, royal tea?
Ooh, I cannot wait!
Collecting gemstones is my favorite!
Ooh!
Magnifique!
This will be perfect for the emerald-encrusted romper I've been working on!
Ugh, Rainbow Dash!
Could you please refrain from all of that racket?
It's muddying my concentration.
[sighs]
Just a moment.
[gasps]
You ruined my gems!
Ugh!
This wasn't about treasure!
It was about finding gemstones for my winter collection!
That, is, This day of fun is officially over!
Oh, puh-lease!
You don't even give my interests a chance!
You have absolutely no respect for the finer things!
No respect, I tell you!
...And then there was the time Rainbow Dash called my Cloudsdale Couture Boutique idea impractical!
Imagine that!
Just because I needed Twilight to perform the butterfly wing spell on me whenever I wanted to deliver merchandise!
Not to mention the day I was wearing a really gorgeous hat, and Rainbow Dash didn't even notice!
Your point?
If you insist.
[giggles]
Please.
Oh, sorry.
It's just that I find those action sequences so ridiculously over-the-top.
Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names?
Doctor whozit-whatsit, Caballeron?
But, the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of The Colt in Crimson: A Shadow Spade Mystery!
You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!
[gasps]
You didn't even read it!
If you can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!
[gasps]
One of the magical items you've been keeping for Princess Celestia?
And if I follow the culprit's clues, I'm certain I can find who took your amulet!
There appear to be no signs of damage to the surrounding artifacts, suggesting the thief did not leave in a hurry.
Pfft!
Those aren't from my boots.
Mine are magenta, not blue.
See?
I mean, really!
Turns out these boots were not made for trotting, as advertised.
Where are you going?
We promised Twilight we'd work together!
That book!
Yes!
The one I-I just, just read!
Ha-ha-ha!
Oopsie?
Fine by me!
Ooh!
Rainbow Dash, slow down!
You're flying past important clues!
Look, it's a print.
But definitely not a hoof.
Are those claw marks?
I hope you don't expect me to, wade through that.
Ooh.
Clever.
What Daring Do book did you get that from?
[sighs]
At least you can fly across.
Ta-daaa!
Mmm.
We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know everything about me yet.
[gasps]
The glitter trail!
It's gone!
Sorry!
What did you say?
Hmmm, [sniffs] Aha!
I think I have the perfect solution.
An old unicorn beauty trick.
That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?
Ooh!
It's adorable!
Um, excuse me, kind sir.
I have a special treat for you in exchange for your information.
It is a magical unicorn delicacy called Effervescence.
Very now.
Very chic.
Sorry, sorry.
Enjoy.
Good.
Uh, now, which way did the sparkly thing go?
Thank you!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go on!
Fly up there and get that amulet!
But how can we?
Thank you.
Or perhaps the key is right here!
I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!
And you called them useless.
I, owe you an apology, too.
Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy.
And you're very good at it.
I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine.
I would very much like that.
Now let's go find that amulet!
[gasps]
Spikey-wikey!
You stole the Amulet of Aurora?
You mean, this was a setup to make us get along?
Heh.
Always.
I think we just needed a teensy reminder.
When we give each other a chance to share the different things we enjoy, it can be surprisingly wonderful!
[sighs]
Too bad we wasted our day of fun.
Do I?
But only if you help me choose some buckball fan attire, so I can cheer for my favorite player at the drop of a fabulous hat!
Yes.
Yes, I can.
Apple-solutely!
Uh, absolutely.
Aah!
Aah!
[sighs]
And I wanted to turn heads with my new fall line, but not like this!
And just look what her playing did to poor Fluttershy!
Well, there's no time like the present.
Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash.
It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.
Let's get started.
Apparently, there's not a moment to lose.
Now this is perfection!
Is she still coming?
This decor is dreadful.
It is a puzzle.
Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, for goodness' sakes!
Maud.
All of your sister's things are gone.
Explain.
Terribly sorry, Maud.
Must've misheard you.
It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's moved to Yakyakistan!
Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack.
Must've misheard you.
It almost sounded like you said she did say that!
Well, no!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
That will not do!
Is that, Indeed.
But what else can we do?
So say we all!
And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!
Ugh!
Hmm.
Has anypony seen my decorative centerpieces?
They were right here.
Would somepony kindly explain what is the meaning of all this water?
One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts.
Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?
Yup.
Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.
Oh, how horrid.
Darling, do be careful.
That's what friends are for, darling.
I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
My magic is go-o-o-one!
I even had to use my hooves to coif my tail!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
Not without us, you wo?
Wait.
Did you say we?
Ugh!
I have had it with these horrible flies!
I miss my magic!
[gasps]
Bite your tongue!
It's for decorative purposes only!
You were saying?
These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid.
Do something, Fluttershy!
I'll get you a towel, darling.
Oh, dear.
I hadn't thought of that.
Not everything can be solved with brute force.
We need magic to escape.
Down! Sit! Good!
I can't say for how much longer.
I'm not sure we did!
Good point.
They know better than to make us worry.
With all due respect, majesties, you might want to save your urgent summons for matters that are a bit more, well, urgent!
Oh, pshaw.
[giggles]
Well, I'm in!
Darlings, we'll all need a complete wardrobe update!
And I would love to pick your brain about mane maintenance when you have a moment.
once you make a plan?
Pony of Shadows.
But, But how is that possible?
I thought the Crystal Heart had dispelled him into the ether!
As magical battles go, that was a cakewalk.
You leave Ponyville alone!
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to be strong, but I just can't bear to think about poor Sweetie Belle under the spell of that monster!
Normally, I wouldn't dream of digging, but right now, show me the muddy!
Sweetie Belle, please stop!
I can't get her to stop!
I can't get her?
Darling, that's oddly specific.
Oh, sorry about this, Fancy Pants!
But we can't just leave them here, all possessed and Sombra-fied!
Ugh!
So he could have ended the whole Sombra thing whenever he wanted?
[giggles]
Life certainly hasn't been dull since we met.
And all of this to win some fillyhood competition with your brother?
Twilight, darling, nopony knows you better than your own brother.
I'm saying your brother will win.
No matter how brilliant your plan is, no matter how many variations you try, it will be something your brother expects, and he'll always win!
Unless, when the perfect chance comes along, you do something he can't expect.
Then you'll win.
A little bit.
It felt like I rushed.
Did I rush it?
We have to do the opposite of what Shining Armor expects.
Therefore, Twilight cannot mastermind the plan.
But I can!
Because my plan is for each of us to devise our own unexpected part of it.
Allow me to demonstrate.
We're looking for a pony with information.
Where is the secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle?
There's always a secret entrance!
Doesn't matter.
It's perfect.
Fluttershy?
Spike?
Oh, no, darling.
That is the plan.
You shall do nothing!
What's this?
Closed?
Then how are we meant to shake down ne'er-do-wells for information?
Yes, thank you.
That will do nicely.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, darling, this couldn't be more perfect!
I am sick of being lost in these slimy corridors, too!
But you shouldn't pull every lever you come across!
Half of them are traps!
It's not worth the risk!
Oh, hello, Spike.
Even if we did find our way back to the castle, we'd still have all of those guar?
Spike?
Fluttershy?
We've both hit dead ends.
Perhaps we should return to the outside and reevaluate.
Eugh!
In retrospect, our plan might have been too unexpected.
At least one part of our expected plan worked unexpectedly.
Next shift.
You're on break.
Ooh!
Oh, terribly sorry, Yona.
All these dresses I'm sewing for the dance have me completely frazzled.
[laughs]
Well, not interrupting exactly.
More like blocking the flow?
uh, stopping me from what I'm doing?
so, yes, interrupting!
[nervous laugh]
Now, what can I do for you, Yona?
Yona could?
I mean, you could.
But the Fetlock Fete or whatever Twilight is calling it, it's all about a tradition.
There's a certain way to do everything at the dance.
Well, uh, y-y-yes, if that's what you really want.
In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance, one must converse in a sophisticated fashion.
Talking with Brussels sprouts in your mouth helps you to learn to ar-ti-cu-late.
Take a mouthful, and repeat after me.
How kind of you to ask me to tea.
May I offer you a glass of punch?
The weather is quite agreeable today.
Let's move on.
We will need to do something about your hairstyle.
But first, let's find the right dress!
Now, purple taffeta, frosted chiffon, Gold brocade!
One of my favorites!
Blech, Earth tones. 
They're so, earthy, aren't they?
Don't worry.
We shall find something to make you stand out.
[sighs]
Quite.
And by the time we're through, it'll be like you've been going to pony dances your whole life.
When I'm finished with you
[gasps]
I almost forgot!
The most important part of the ball!
Oh, not that, darling.
The dancing!
And I know precisely who can help!
Absolutely.
We'll start with the slow dance, the Pony Cotillion.
That's Fluttershy's specialty.
[sighs]
Oh, my!
Some.
Indeed.
And we only have a few more days.
Uh, I already told Yona a little bit about that tradition.
She's even brought her own lucky, bucket.
Yona, if someone at the party tells you they're thirsty, you say...
By Celestia, I think she's got it!
Yona!
You look absolutely scrumptious, darling.
Uh, why don't I get that for you?
What a calamitous yak-ccident!
[sighs]
[gasps]
We never meant to try to turn you into something you're not.
Your actions tonight exemplify the true meaning of friendship.
It would be an honor.
Spikey-Wikey!
But suddenly, Celestia and Luna seem to think we can't do anything on our own.
Jolly good.
Ah, what a relief.
How rude.
So we're just going to have to do with sequins!
Still rude.
I need gemstones!
And purple satin!
Gosh, Cheese hardly seems the factory type.
I just assumed he'd continue to wander Equestria throwing parties.
Still, you must be excited to see him.
[giggles]
I agree completely.
My goodness!
How are you feeling about all this?
Spike, we're going to update the Flaming Sky Firework Unicorn Troupe with Twilight's new vision.
The Flaming Sky Firework Troupe is a marvel.
You've done an outstanding job.
Oh, Twilight is finally learning not to let her stress get the better of her.
If she finds out everything went wrong, it could be devastating!
What about aiming for perfection?
But you were so excited before.
What changed?
Nopony understands wanting to take pride in your work more than I do!
Oh, pffft.
Nopony makes frills anymore.
This season's actually all about simplicity?
You did tell us you'd changed.
Oh, Spiiiike?
Are you in here?
Hellooooo?
Spike?
Oh, there you are!
I was starting to think you weren't here.
I realize this is last-minute, but I've decided on a quick trip to the gem cave!
I am on an urgent mission to find some faceted iridescence for my new design, and I can't think of anypony I'd rather have along than my favorite basket holder/bodyguard Spike.
Spike?
Spiiiike?
SPIKE!
Honestly, Spike.
It's almost as if you haven't been listening.
[sighs]
I was saying that I had planned on visiting the gem cave?
Aah!
Of course, you're right.
This is a bit of a late start, and those gems won't pick themselves.
But the real question is which basket do you want to hold?
The smaller one, right?
[laughs]
The, gem cave?
[laughs]
All right, very funny.
Obviously, you'll get the bigger basket, and I shall?
Spike?
Hello?
I don't understand.
For as long as we've known each other, Spike has never turned down an opportunity to join me here.
It's his favorite place.
Ideally you catch the gems, dear.
And for a trip to the post office of all places?
Maybe you should move closer?
And why would Spike need to go to the post office at all?
He sends mail by breathing!
Breathing, darling!
Breath mail!
Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would.
Well, for one thing, Spike knows how to keep things quiet so as not to waken the bats.
And he usually pulls me closely so no gem ever touches the ground!
Actually, Applejack, I had noticed!
Ugh!
Besides my mane?
Well, that is a question for Spike.
Again?
What is it with Spike and the post office?
Spike declined my invitation to the gem cave, and I intend to find out why.
A fight?
Goodness, Twilight.
What in Equestria would we fight about?
Well, certainly.
But I think I'd remember if we had an argument.
Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it?
I wonder if that's it.
It certainly would explain his behavior.
I must apologize!
Oh, pfft.
That's hardly the point.
Poor Spikey-Wikey!
This calls for a grand gesture!
I'm not mailing it.
I didn't realize griffons worked at the Ponyville Post Office.
[sighs]
Yes, well, uh, these things aren't for sending.
They're for apologizing to Spike.
That's perfect!
It'll give me a chance to practice.
Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes.
Darling, I don't see why that matters.
And that is why I simply cannot bear the thought of having hurt you!
And even though I don't know what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter!
Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right!
And scene.
Oh, sorry, dear.
Here.
Well, of course it sounds genuine!
It is genuine!
Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike.
I don't know how I could be more genuine.
I mean?
[gasps]
Spike!
Oh, Spike!
I am so sorry!
Please forgive me!
You have to forgive me!
I don't know what I did or why you're mad at me!
Just please say you forgive me!
Pleeeeeeeease!
Why does everypony keep harping on that?
Wait.
Don't you know?
B-But, But I don't understand.
If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?
[gasps]
I don't understand.
You two know each other?
[forced laugh]
Yes, Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave.
Having a friend in town is a rare treat.
Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow.
Fabric shopping?
I know how you love to pick out the colors.
Well, all right.
You two fly along.
I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other, time?
I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal!
And there's the pink!
How will I ever choose?
He is a good sounding board, isn't he?
[sighs]
Could you bring the pincushion a little closer, dear?
I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years.
Even closer, darling.
I don't want to prick you.
I have to admit everything feels a bit less than without him.
Too close!
Oh, darling, it's no use.
Thank you for trying.
I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon.
Oh, I am sorry, Spike.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, I realize it's late.
Or rather, early.
But I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it.
The Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!
It is only accessible once a year, and I thought a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help you've given me over the years.
I see.
Well, there's always next year.
Are you sure?
What did I tell you?
Oh, no apology necessary, Spike.
In fact, I was just looking for you.
Because I just acquired, these!
Mm-hmm!
I know we just went to the Crevasse, but I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for all you do.
Indeed.
I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!
Whoo.
I know what you mean.
Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note.
Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well.
[laughs]
I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together.
Well, I know how much you enjoy it.
And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game.
Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?
Oooh!
Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!
What do you think, Spike?
Solids or prints?
Oh, you are so right.
Prints it is!
So nice to have you back, Spike.
Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby.
I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike.
[clears throat]
Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza.
I, suppose, it's possible it could have something to do with, Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore.
They were!
Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all!
But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of O&O, I managed to get some time in.
What?
Pfft!
I most certainly did not!
Well, I, suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit.
[sighs]
I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.
I know, but now I have to share him!
Which I suppose I'll have to get used to.
[gasps]
Right after I fix the mess I've made!
I am here to apologize.
Actually, more to confess.
And all of this stuff isn't for Spike.
It's the evidence against me!
For my acts of utter selfishness!
These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!
Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the two of you can renew your friendship, Spike.
Now please, even if you can't forgive me, you simply must forgive?
[gasps]
Spike?
I actually owe you an apology, too.
I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back.
I am truly sorry.
Oh, of course!
Wonderful!
I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have, reconciled.
I suppose Twilight is right.
Friendships do change.
Of course Spike and I will always be friends, and I can get used to sharing him.
Darling.
Catching the gems is what the basket is for.
Spike!
How wonderful to see you!
I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa.
I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.
Well, I could.
But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business.
What?
Oh, my dear, no!
Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment.
You could end up in the wrong place entirely.
Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?
And you're sure this is where Pinkie told us to get the blackberries for her special coronation dessert?
Ooh!
Twilight, darling!
You're just in time.
Only one more pre-coronation stop.
We're picking up the final touch for your apres-hors d'oevres gown...
What?
I haven't made one of those!
You must tell me when they add these sorts of things!
Well, that's odd.
They look open.
Well, this being a thread shop, I thought I might buy some?
You know designers.
Don't like being interrupted when they're on a creative roll.
With thread this exquisite, can you blame them?
It's the first shift in royal power in over a millenium.
Of course everypony is a little jumpy.
Change does that.
You did?
But why?
You beastly beast!
Don't you know how much this day means to Twilight?
And me?
I made her dress!
Why wait until now for such a horrible plan?
[groans]
Go, Twilight!
Get help!
Where is everypony?
It's what we always do, darling.
Post-apocalyptic donuts.
Interesting choice.
Darling, change is an integral part of fashion.
I myself am considering opening boutiques for non-ponies.
Things must evolve, or they become stale.
For example, I was just struck with a sudden inspiration to change my design for your gown by including the webs of these star spiders.
They glow for a short while after they're spun.
They won't have much time to weave the sash, but the effect will be dazzling.
You see, darling?
Change can be fabulous if you embrace it!
Oh, you won't be traveling alone, darling.
I'll have just enough time on the train to weave the star spider sash for your gown.
But we should leave now.
There's no time to dawdle if you want the coronation to be perfect.
I suppose it gave us something else to focus on.
Rattled to the core.
I just can't stop thinking about how much things are going to change!
I'd worked out exactly how much time I needed to weave my star spider sash, and now I'm behind!
She can't possibly be crowned without wearing her coronation gown!
You look amazing.
Ooh!
I almost forgot!
But now that we'll be living in different places, I'm not exactly sure how.
TWILIGHT!
Oh, sorry, darling, but I just realized you're not wearing your crown.
You haven't forgotten it back in Ponyville, have you?
You are a princess now, Twilight.
Embrace it!
I'm telling you, if I had a crown like that, I would never take it off.
Why, I'd sleep in the thing.
Perfect!
Oh, yes.
This is good!
No one will recognize you!
And we'll need a disguise for your dog, which is too bad.
He really is so adorable!
Y'know, with a little work, I think I could make him look like a rabbit instead.
So much for the disguise.
I do have an eye for these sorts of things.
Not that you seem to care.
Pff.
Kch.
Don't play innocent, Pinkie Pie!
You are no better than she is!
I am happy to offer up my assistance as well.
To someone who would appreciate what I have to offer!
You mean like how you've gotten over what happened with Rainbow Dash?
Yes.
Well, it's a nice theory, darling, but Sunset Shimmer had nothing to do with it.
You don't think she's the one who's been sending me those e-mails, do you?
Every time I volunteer to help with the decorations at a school function, I get an e-mail from Pinkie Pie saying she has plenty of volunteers!
And then I find out she's done everything herself.
They're actually talking!
That's a good sign!
I, really thought you were gonna, pull it off there in the end!
Don't even think about it!
You're already trying to get her crown.
Who knows what Sunset Shimmer would do if you ended up getting her ex-boyfriend too?
I'VE GOT IT!
Ahem.
I mean, um, perhaps I have a solution.
Now this may be an absolutely preposterous idea, but what if we all wore these as a sign of unity?
Freshman year, they were very, very popular.
A way for everybody to show their school spirit!
You know?
Go, Canterlot Wondercolts!
Ahem.
I haven't sold any in ages.
I mean, the five of us are obviously very different, but deep down, we're all Canterlot Wondercolts!
Sunset Shimmer is the one who divided us, Twilight Sparkle is the one who united us.
And we're gonna let everyone know it!
What do you think?
Doesn't everyone look just fabulous?
Everything okay in there?
He can talk!
Gah, You're a princess?
I simply cannot believe they did all this!
Absolutely!
Enough chatter, girls.
We need to get ready, and we need to look fabulous!
It's no wonder you're a real live princess!
I, for one, think you're adorable.
Of course we will.
Although I do expect some sort of apology for last spring's debacle.
You've got your crown!
What did they wear?
[gasp]
She does!
She absolutely does!
Rainbow Dash, I simply don't understand why you can't just play the guitar you have.
[gasps]
Now I understand.
Oh, but of course, darling.
Helping cute little puppies and kitties will never go out of style.
Ooh.
Uh, Fluttershy, darling, aren't hamsters, uh, rodents?
Aah!
Well, uh, Carl Pettington's coat just begged to be accessorized, but Emilia Furhart refused to be left out and got Curtis Pawpower to chew right through Carl's little scarf, and before I knew it, I had a habitat-wide feud on my hands!
Also, I named them.
Huh!
I never would have guessed hamsters could be so touchy about fashion!
We've got to find an outlet for all that energy!
Whatever made you think of Pinkie for the drums?
Come on, Rarity!
You simply must get this piano to band practice!
What kind of person doesn't put a piano on wheels?
Just look at me.
I'm a mess.
What I need is a bit more muscle.
Oh, boys!
I simply cannot thank you enough.
And while I am a bit repulsed by your musky smell, I can appreciate that you're all diamonds in the rough.
Excuse me!
Pardon me!
Excuse me!
Thank you!
Tada!
Heavens, no!
The grand piano is the most refined and elegant of instruments.
With it, I will be able to express my full musicality.
Huh?
Awww, Ooh!
Oooh!
Oh, my!
Fine, fine.
I don't suppose...
Why, you only paid Granny Smith two dollars for it!
Her initials are monogrammed right on the strap.
Quite the eye-catching advertisement, if I do say so myself.
Oh, darling, you have us, and we've forgiven you for your past, ahem, booboos.
[laughs]
I still can't believe that happens when we play!
Ooh!
I've got to look into some new accessories!
Something that looks good in a longer ponytail.
Ooh!
Maybe some clip-on earrings for when I get those adorable pony ears.
Your band?
Well.
[giggles]
Someone is quite the smitten kitten.
Sorry.
I always forget you and Flash used to be an item.
Mmm, horrid.
[sighs]
If only we could get a message to Twilight.
Maybe she could tell us how to break the spell the Dazzlings have cast on our friends.
That's a book, darling.
What do you mean, maybe still works?
How is that even possible?
And don't forget to dress well.
Oh, I do hate that you had to return at a time of crisis.
There's so much catching up to do!
Perhaps you would give us just the slightest bit of gossip from your world?
A castle?
You have your own castle?
Eh, Ooh, uh, lovely.
The band competition!
That's the next time we can be certain everyone will be in the same place at the same time.
And I believe you, Twilight, just became the Rainbooms' newest member.
Twilight, I think I speak for all of us when I say I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come back to help us.
Or, perhaps we could take a short break, try on some of the wardrobe choices I've put together?
I'm particularly fond of this one.
Eh, of course we could always go with something a bit more modern.
Oh, you can never have enough costumes!
But how do you propose we do that?
Here!
I'm here!
We will be performing in front of an audience.
I'm not going to wear something fabulous?
Hmph.
[gasps]
Ruined!
Absolutely ruined!
Wh- Oh!
This was not my fault!
This was an act of sabotage!
Ugh.
Close the curtains?
Unplug her amp?
Give us a chance to deal with the situation?
What can we do?
There isn't gonna be another opportunity for us to play.
And I had the most gorgeous outfit for the finals!
You know perfectly well that is not what I meant!
She was talking about you, Rainbow Dash!
I had the most perfect outfits for us to wear!
I care, Applejack!
So sorry if I enjoy trying to make a creative contribution to the band!
I wish I'd never agreed to be in it!
Ooh, which version of the counter-spell are we going to play?
I thought you'd never ask!
Really, Rainbow Dash!
I was in the middle of sewing a very complex appliqu‚ on my latest frock.
Agreed.
I have no interest in another fight against the powers of evil magic.
The wear and tear on my wardrobe is just too much to keep up with.
Because that's just what the students at Crystal Prep would do?
[scoffs]
That's putting it mildly, darling.
They're still revamping the playing field in preparation.
Oh, dear.
I hope this speech isn't meant to be motivational.
I feel like my school pride is at an all-time high!
We don't need magic to defeat those hoity-toity Crystal Preppers.
[giggles]
Anything?
How will I ever pick the right outfit?
Easier said than done, darling.
I'm sure in Equestria, magic does whatever you want.
And while Sunset works on keeping the magic out of the games, I've been working on what to put in!
[giggles]
Well, I had a little time on my hands, and since we don't know what the Friendship Games' events are, I made a few options for uniforms!
I know.
I know!
[giggles]
Oh, pff.
Kch.
Fff.
Don't be silly, darling!
Putting effort into clothes is what I live for, and spending time on my friends fills me with energy!
Actually, Applejack, now that you mention it, I suppose I could use a tiny break.
Darling, those glasses.
What are you wearing?
It's so, severe.
I can't believe our world's Twilight goes to Crystal Prep!
We certainly can't expect her to drop everything and pop through the portal whenever.
Especially if it's to deal with something as minor as a few random pony-ups.
But don't you remember, darling?
What we needed to defeat them was you.
Well, you might use a little tact.
Yes.
If only that Principal Cinch hadn't frozen it again.
Truly amazing!
Or me right before we met Twilight!
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Of course I did!
Come on!
It's a little hard to focus with all the magic stealing and portal opening.
Obviously!
If we were going to the moon, I'd insist she packed an evening gown.
One never knows, darling.
[sighs]
I'm just after some R&R.
The past year has all been a bit too much for my tastes.
Ooh!
Oh, uh, a fashion show!
Where I design the most fabulous camp looks inspired by today's hottest trends and have them modeled by my classmates in a gorgeous outdoor setting!
Ooh, me, too!
Ooh!
That was adorable!
[sighs]
I'm all for learning safety rules, but I do hope I can get started on my designs for the camp fashion show sooner rather than later.
It's clear from Gloriosa's own wardrobe that she appreciates a well put together look.
Even if we are in the middle of the woods.
Yes!
[chuckles]
Don't worry, darling.
It'll absolutely speak to your personal sense of style...
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?
It looks like a diamond shining in the sun!
[gasps]
It's stunning!
And will make an absolutely perfect runway for my camp fashion show!
Oh, you say tomato, I say perfect place to showcase glamorous boho-chic stylings.
...And that's when she looked down and realized she was wearing purple socks with a burgundy dress!
Purple and burgundy, darlings!
The same color family!
Oh, hear-hear.
We've had to deal with more than our fair share of those.
At the Fall Formal, a musical showcase, the Friendship Ga?
Well, I mean, you know, everything turned out all right, of course [nervous chuckle]
What's that?
We have to try!
Camp Everfree needs a runway!
Dock.
Yes.
That's what I meant.
Well, you have to wait a little longer, darling.
I-I believe I'd like to come down now!
Applejack!
What are you doing?
I was scared half to death!
No, thank you!
Oh, dear!
I am so sorry!
I think.
Did I just do whatever that was?
And I made a diamondy thing appear out of nowhere, which normally I'd be excited about.
I mean, the facets were just perfect, and the?
Oh, sorry.
It knocked Applejack over and then it disappeared!
But if you had some sort of super speed, why you were gone for so long?
Nobody did.
I was oh, so excited about designs I've come up with for the camp fashion show.
Um, Pinkie Pie, what are you doing?
Oh, I'd love to, but I really need to get the stitching on this poncho done if it's going to make it into the camp fashion show.
Though at the pace you two are moving, I don't know that the runway will ever be finished.
[sighs]
Sorry, girls.
I didn't mean to.
I don't know how to control this.
Please, please, please can we do a run-through for the fashion show on it right this minute?
I am now.
Where are Twilight and Sunset?
[sighs]
they're missing our dress rehearsal.
I suppose we can get started without them.
Whenever you're ready!
Hmm.
Told you you'd like it.
This is only a preview.
I've got another entire line I'll debut at the real thing.
Why did you stop the?
[gasps]
Oh, my goodness!
What are we going to do?
Oh, me, too!
Gloriosa, let's just think about this for a moment, shall we?
I mean, I think Camp Everfree is absolutely delightful, but I just don't know that I'm quite ready to give up my weekly trips to the spa.
Twilight!
I can't keep this up forever!
Agh!
I almost don't care what they are.
They are gorgeous!
[gasps]
And will totally go with the other collection I was working on for the camp fashion show!
[giggles]
That's probably cancelled, isn't it?
Or a ball?
[gasps]
A Crystal Ball!
I love it!
Adorable.
All that matters is that the runway is finished.
Oh, to-mah-to, tomato.
[sighs]
How about a little break?
All of this sunshine and suds are doing a number on my hair.
Not to worry, darlings.
It's my turn to devise a plan, and I already have something amazing in mind.
It will be the most profitable of all of our fundraising events!
The piŠce de r‚sistance!
Meet me in the music room later this afternoon, and I will explain everything.
How did you know?
Oh, rats.
Three hours and still no ideas for a lucrative last-minute fundraiser.
Usually, window-shopping inspires me.
Hmm?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, and, obviously!
Yes!
Oh, we're certain to win!
[gasps]
Sour Sweet!
Sunny Flare!
Why, it's been ages.
Is that all?
Wow!
[giggles]
How is everything over at Crystal Prep Academy?
Ooh, sounds divine.
I am!
Heh-heh.
Are you girls here to sign up for the competition?
Yes, it came to me as soon as I saw that gorgeous red ruffled ensemble on the way over here.
Well, each member of the Rainbooms is going to dance in a different style?
like flamenco, hip-hop, or street ballet?
and we'll wear costumes to match each genre.
Designed by yours truly, of course.
[giggles]
Thanks!
So, what's your concept?
Oh, well, I can't wait to see it.
Good luck!
See?
It's a wonderful plan.
We'll write some lyrics for our new song, and we'll choreograph some dance moves.
Then our video will win a cash prize, and voila!
That's because it is!
The girls at Crystal Prep even agree.
They're making a video, too.
I-Is that a problem, darling?
Okay, before we get started with the choreographing of our dance moves and, there's just one tiny, teeny-weensey, little thing I forgot to mention.
Uhhhh, I would need to use our fundraiser money to buy costume materials for the video!
More than double what we need to fix up Camp Everfree!
All right, girls.
Who's ready to shoot our winning dance music video?
[laughs]
Looks like I have some fabric shopping to do!
Let's take it from the top one more time.
Rainbow Dash, don't forget your cue.
It's when Fluttershy does her triple pirouette, okay?
And, action!
Cut!
Fluttershy, it's supposed to be a triple pirouette.
Darling, of course you can, darling.
I believe in you.
Oh, I know.
But if we want to win, we have to bring our A-game!
Let's take it from Rainbow's entrance.
[sighs]
And, action!
This is a disaster!
Well, I can fix it, but I'll have to run to the fabric store before it closes.
Keep practicing while I'm gone!
Ahhh!
Oh, thank goodness I budgeted for backup fabric.
[gasps]
Is that a disco-inspired look?
And a street ballet tutu?
I don't believe it.
They stole my brilliant idea!
Well, since you asked, the answer is no!
Sour Sweet, and the, Crystal, Prep girls stole our video concept!
I saw them filming at the mall.
They copied my design ideas and everything!
So of course they looked absolutely fabulous.
But the worst part is that they're all incredible dancers!
Everyone is counting on me, on the video to win us the prize money for the camp.
[sighs]
Oh, how could I have been such a fool?
Of course, those Crystal Preppers stole my concept!
I practically served it to them on a platter!
Hmm?
W-What do you mean?
Nonsense!
You all looked great!
[sighs]
Okay, maybe not great, but, but, but it was getting there!
And the point is we don't have to let them win!
That is our video concept!
And I am going straight to Crystal Prep to let them know that they have messed with the wrong girls!
Mmm!
Who's with me?
No, n-no, seriously, who is with me?
I have no idea how to get to Crystal Prep.
That's the spirit!
Come on!
Okay, where's the dance studio?
Didn't you go to this school?
Wait, shhh.
That's their music.
Bingo!
Don't change the subject, Sour Sweet!
You, either!
You know why we're here!
You stole my?
our music video idea!
Now, change your concept, or else!
You're what?
It doesn't matter!
Because we are still doing our video the way we planned!
Oh, this is all my fault!
All the money we raised is gone, and now we have no music video!
I should never have convinced you all that we could pull this off in so little time!
What I want is a new video concept!
Really?
Okay.
I suppose it's worth a try.
Aah!
Wait.
So basically, we are eating pastries at school in our music video?
Anyone have another idea?
Please, do tell.
Stop!
This will never work!
Because the contest is for dance music videos, and not one of your ideas included dancing at all!
Okay?
No, I am not okay!
The contest deadline is tomorrow, and we have just been wasting time!
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.
They just don't want to disappoint their classmates.
Excuse me, girls.
Long enough to hear that you have no original song.
Maybe you're not.
Look, I know our teams haven't been getting along too well lately.
But I think I have a solution where everybody wins.
They are, yes.
But so are we!
Girls, you can come out now!
I know it's hard to believe, but the Crystal Preppers here helped me to realize that competing against one another was getting us nowhere.
The Crystal Prep Academy girls have offered to help with dance moves if we'll help them with an original song.
So, what do you guys think?
Are you in?
Anybody else care to work on some music?
Music first.
Music first!
Music first!
Oh, yeah.
Lights!
Action!
[gasps]
Ohhh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
I have just had the most brilliant idea!
Maybe Crystal Prep could use an award-winning band to play at their spring dance?
It'll be the perfect way to show off your new dance moves!
Oh, no.
What?
Oh, I already have some ideas that I'd be willing to share.
Get my picture taken with Chestnut Magnifico, the actress playing Daring Do!
Darling, please.
Actresses love interacting with their fans.
Oh, Miss Magnifico!
[giggles]
She probably just didn't see us.
Oh, no-no-no-no.
Certainly not!
Yes, but she said she wanted something shut down.
We don't know that she was talking about the movie.
Chestnut Magnifico is an acclaimed actress!
She'd never do something so dramatic!
You mean like that one?
I don't see how.
She moves so fast, she could be anywhere on the lot by now.
Why she felt it necessary to wear the geode that gives her super-speed to a movie set, I'll never know.
Did you just make that lock unlock itself?
I told you all it wasn't Chestnut!
Yet, darling.
Yet.
And that's bad how, precisely?
Uh, Any clue yet where we are or what just happened?
Anyone?
How could this happen on the evening of my very first movie premiere?
Of all the nights!
Curse you, cruel fate!
Mmm, true.
But perhaps we can agree it's in the top five.
Oh, my heavens!
What's that?
You mean Twilight's student back in Equestria?
I'm going with not a good thing!
Ooh.
Hello, me.
[giggles, smooches]
Perfect!
Now my visage matches my fabulous Fall Formal attire.
[giggles]
Okay.
Who's next?
Aha!
Applejack, darling!
Come sit here.
I shall now transform your drab makeup look into something dance-worthy.
Oh, pff.
Kch.
It's not called the Fall Informal!
Oh, I would never!
My goodness!
I have simply outdone myself!
Soooo?
Mmm.
Mmm.
It was nothing...
I beg your pardon!
Does this mean I can keep the wings?
[giggles]
She was right about one thing.
That was the final interruption!
[gasps]
My goodness!
Look at Countess Coloratura!
They've caught a picture of her falling over during yoga class!
[laughs]
Ooh!
[laughs]
Lucky we never do anything that embarrassing.
Right, girls?
Let's do it!
I can't thank you enough for filling in for my babysitting emploi, Pinkie Pie.
I couldn't pass up the last-minute ticket to the Young Designers' Gala.
Oh, you're a small pink lifesaver!
Toodle-oo!
Whyever do you have that swine accompanying you to school, Applejack?
Sweeties, darlings, loveys, it's not a competition.
Not all the clubs.
Uh-uh-uh, darlings.
It's very exclusive.
Oh, well, of course.
You can't expect me to be the president and the vice-president.
Well, so long as we use it in moderation, our magic should stay under control?
[gasps]
[sighs]
After working here for months and months, I knew I'd finally do something to catch your eye!
Really?
[gasps]
Thank you, Ms Hemline!
You will not regret this!
Thank you for the opportunity!
[sighs]
I thrive under pressure.
One does not become a diamond without pressure.
IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE!
What in heavens will I do?
I have tried everything, fringe, appliques, cheese!
The muse has left me!
Another piece by the secretive street artist Flanksy.
I wonder what it's like not to want credit and praise for one's genius creations.
This mural is everything I want to say, but through paint instead of fabric!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
Yes, uh, it's a postmodern installation piece celebrating the creative process?
Ooh, who am I kidding?
It's atrocious!
This window's not avant-garde, it's avant-marred!
It's supposed to be finished by tomorrow!
I'M GOING HOME!
Au revoir, career!
Huh?
[gasps]
[gasps]
Ooh, just think of the fashion!
The city is our oyster!
[gasps]
The cupcakes will have to wait for justice!
Is everything okay, Fluttershy?
Oh, no!
There they are!
Complete disaster!
My earring's gone!
A one-of-a-kind, irreplaceable work of art!
I should know.
I made it.
I was reapplying my SPF when I realized my ear was, naked!
I don't know what to do!
It meant so much to me!
And, and...
Oh, would you mind?
I took the liberty of getting some equipment.
[gasps]
Could it be?
[gasps]
[sighs]
Well, not to worry.
We've got plenty of time.
I can't believe this!
We've combed the entire beach and found nothing!
Nothing!
I'm sorry I've wasted your entire day.
But the sun's going down.
[sighs]
I guess it's a lost cause.
It's, not.
But thank you, both of you.
I had a wonderful day just the same.
Uh, I'll just take one last sweep.
Guh.
Ooh!
Found it!
Heh-heh.
Oh, not a problem.
My whole life has been leading up to this moment!
Voila!
Crustacean couture!
Right on time.
I hate to say it, but these crabs are getting awfully, crabby!
Well, just serendipitous that we're setting sail, because I am winded.
Hmm?
Oh, just a change of clothes and a coat in case it gets chilly.
Also, a small folding table, various tools, a fashion reference library, and a bag of gems.
You know, the essentials.
Hmph.
[gasps]
Especially if your friends have towels!
Don't worry, darling.
I can fix this!
Do you have glitter on you?
Hello, darlings!
I can't wait for my fabulous new dressing room and?
Sorry.
[laughs]
Promise I won't make another peep.
Ooh, just a dash of peep.
How many trees are we going to need?
Thirty?
Darling, that seems a bit excessive!
[yawns]
Yes, this is positively electrifying.
[yawns]
Oh, now the real fun begins.
I've been having so much fun the whole time.
[sighs]
[yawns]
Hello, darlings!
Welcome to Street Chic with Rarity!
A show that keeps you ahead of the curve, so you're always the first girl on your block to wear the most glittering and glamorous frocks in fashion!
This week, I am bringing you the latest in summer flair!
So let's get started!
As you can see, Applejack has a simply scrumptious country style that really works for her.
So I will just make some simple tweaks.
[gasps]
Sometimes I just shock myself with how good I am!
Nonsense!
You look gorgeous!
And oh, so summer!
It may be fall, darling, but we in the fashion world are in summer mode.
And now, so are you!
She's sporty!
She's stylish!
And she needs a sensational summer look to dazzle all the other sports, people?
Anyway, It's elegant yet still sporty!
She'll be bringing drama along with the summer sun!
Ignore the nature, Rainbow Dash.
Summer chic is a state of mind.
We'll see you next time on Street Chic with Rarity!
Until then, don't forget to strike a pose!
Ugh.
Remind me to do our photoshoots indoors from now on.
[shudders]
[sighs]
Okay!
Phew!
[groans]
This is the strangest math class I've ever been in.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Follow that motorbike!
[gasps]
They're shopping without me.
I've never felt so betrayed in all my life!
I guess their plans don't involve me.
Driver, take me home!
I guess I'll just be alone by myself while all my friends are having fun together, without?
Wha, Of course not, darling!
I knew you had something up your sleeve from the very beginning!
Hello, internet darlings!
It's your music festival muses Rarity and Applejack here, presenting our camping must-haves.
Of course, your SPF won't be complete without a chapeau.
And it should match your parasol and your blanket, of course.
And maybe a scarf.
Be sure to include one or two all-natural moisturizers.
It never hurts to have a whole set.
Oh, I'll fit them in, darling.
I'll just tuck them in next to the cushioned seat cover, air-freshening candle set, and four-panel privacy screen.
Plus pillows!
Travel pillows, body pillows, accent pillows, throw pillows, bolster pillows, hypoallergenic pillows...
This is a one-of-a-kind bespoke four-poster bed!
I absolutely must have it!
But, darling, we're not camping.
We're glamping!
Ooh, what filter are you going to use, darling?
[laughs]
Oh, no-no-no-no-no, sweetheart, no.
They are so much more.
You can model the latest trend with Shape Chic.
Birds' Eyes!
Some say the best part of a music festival is the music.
But to me, it's fashion!
[gasps]
I believe they're famished for fashion.
Innovative!
Who's next?
Touchdown!
Aah!
And there you have it, my loves.
At the end of the day, it's always in fashion to be utterly yourselves.
See you at the festival!
Ugh!
Aah!
Hey, dars!
That's what we're calling darlings now.
It's all part of our new slang-uage we're calling...
Everything's cooler when you abbreviate it.
Suh-tuh-guh-buh-nuh-nuh?
That is the power of 'breev's.
'P' to the 'breev'!
Whoa!
Aah!
Thank you, Flash.
Now for this week's most essential forecast: trends, featuring me, Rarity, your on-trend friend.
As always, I look to Prim Hemline's style guide for inspiration.
[sighs]
Which I have memorized, so, uh, the latest trend simply has to be, uh...
Don't panic, Rarity.
You once made a skirt out of slap bracelets.
You can find inspiration anywhere!
The latest trend: Smart is Chic!
I may have taken the teeniest, tiniest, little bit of inspiration from, well, you.
I'm sorry, Twilight.
And not to worry.
Dramatic capes are about to pop!
The latest trend has to be, rainbows!
Sherbets, sprinkles, or rainbow hair, it's all in!
Oh, so glad I found you, Rainbow Dash.
I am tailoring a particularly tricky pinafore, and I was wondering if...
Oh, uh, thank you.
Uh, b-but I'm late for, b-being over there.
I just had the most embarrassing mix-up.
I thought I was talking to you?
No, no.
No, it can't-can't be.
Excuse me!
Submitted for your approval.
A portrait of a school taken over by a trend.
Namely, a hairstyle.
Rainbow in nature, the calling card of one ROY G.
BIV.
Oof!
So if you choose to enroll in this class-wide craze, hurry up and catch the bus headed for, the Rainbow Zone.
[gasps]
Confetti!
Of course!
Well, this place needed a little color, don't you think?
[sighs]
This afternoon's trend forecast, Detention.
Ooh!
Nothing holds a candle to the glamour of legitimate theater.
I was born for the lead, Selfie Soot!
A coal miner's daughter with the heart of a dancer.
Wow.
She really knows how to make an entrance.
Pirate, plane, alligator, thumbs up, waterfall, golf club, ice cream sundae.
Hmmm.
Sounds like you could use a translator.
As you are no doubt keenly aware, I am fluent in all the latest text slang, phone lingo.
[chuckles]
If I may?
No, no, darling.
Robot, shooting star, trophy?
Oh, he's a witty one.
Fancy dress, anvil, high-five, napkin...
Shh-shh!
Darling, darling.
Do you like ice cream?
Check mark, check mark, couple holding hands, sunshine, three balloons, spoon!
[chuckles]
Oh, well, I started by sending a dragon because you're powerful, ice cube and snail because you're cool but take it slow, and then pyramid, well, for obvious reasons.
Then he was way into it, so in this last one, I was just double-checking.
You and Timber Spruce have a date on Sunday at three o'clock to have ice cream.
You're welcome.
Mother, I fear I do not share your dreams of coal.
Instead, my heartbeat calls for me to dance!
Ahem.
Heartbeat calls for me to dance?
To dance!
Oh, pfft.
Darling, is that all?
I can take you any time you like.
Isn't it fabulous?
I rented it for the day.
If you're going to study driving, you must do it in style.
I call it stretch chic.
Now, just a few things that you absolutely must know.
Always have both sparkling and still water.
You never know which one your passengers will prefer.
Never play the music too loud or too soft.
It has to be just enough that their heads bob but not so much that they cover their ears.
And finally, always have your lights on the ready in case of an impromptu party breaking out.
Darling, can't we do both?
Just a little bit?
No, an inch to the left.
Now?
ooh, careful!
The shoulder!
Watch the shoulder!
Ooh, driving can be stressful, darling.
[gasps]
Somebody's pilfered my bedazzled boot, eh?
Not good.
But a new case falling right into my lap?
Not bad.
Don't you worry your sweet red head, redhead.
Speaking as the lead whose foot that boot adorns, and the costume designer whose mind dreamt of it in the first place, let me assure you I shall find the boot.
But where to begin?
Somebody's got to know something.
What do you say, Miss Pie, if that's your real name?
Pinkie, it couldn't have been you.
You were nowhere near the auditorium when it went missing.
You were at the frozen yogurt shop.
You literally still have frozen yogurt in your hand.
I could tell that dame had a sweet tooth for trouble.
There's still something you're not telling me.
You saw something!
Slow down.
This is bigger than spoons!
P-P-Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie, please!
Have you or have you not seen my boot?
[gasps]
You solved the mystery!
Solving a case never tasted so good.
The moment she strutted into my office, I already knew she was guilty.
Only guilty people strut like that.
That's a guilty person strut.
The dame wasn't talking, and that was fine.
I can not talk, too.
I can not talk for hours.
I'm not even talking right now.
Looks like Trixie picked up a racket and decided to play.
Oh, she's good.
But I had a little special something prepared.
Spike?
You want to dance in the play?
Aw, we'll find a spot for you, Spike, but next time you borrow a boot, ask first.
Case closed.
Detectives trust their instincts, and mine were telling me to check the costume rack.
Of all the people, Maud?
Honestly, I never pegged you for a crook!
Who put you up to it?
What do you got against my big debut?
Why aren't you answering me?
Why?
Why?
Why?
They're just rhinestones, darling.
A t-t-two-and-a-half-ton bedazzling gem?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I am.
Glimmering, gleaming, glitzing geodes, all for me!
[sighs]
Ma, Pa, I have got to leave this humdrum, do-nothin', lump-of-coal town.
I'm goin' to be the best disco dancer that Club Amethyst has ever seen!
How will I ever become a disco dancer when all I know is coal, coal, coal?
Whatever is the matter, girls?
I thought you were excited for the soiree.
Don't worry, girls.
In the fashion industry, there is no room for compromise, and I happen to be an excellent negotiator.
Good evening, Mr Cranky Doodle.
I am here representing the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
I understand you are denying them the use of a projector.
Uh, let the record show that Mr Cranky Doodle has identified the projector in question.
So, if I am understanding you correctly, this is your projector.
And you take it home with you when the school day ends.
That's right.
You can't do that, can you?
In fact, this projector cannot leave the school premises because it isn't your projector at all.
It is the property of Canterlot High School, a public school funded by hardworking taxpayers such as Applejack and myself!
So, technically, is this not the taxpayers' projector?
My projector?
Applejack's projector?
Therefore, did you not lie under oath when you identified it as your own?
This whole projector situation is out of order!
I'm confiscating this as evidence.
You think you'd feel more comfortable if someone were there to supervise it?
Oh, delighted we could reach a settlement.
In exchange for the projector, he could attend the party to supervise said projector.
Looks like they threw a splendid party after all.
Where are those girls, anyway?
Thank you, Flash.

In exchange for the projector, he could attend the party to supervise said projector.
Looks like they threw a splendid party after all.
Where are those girls, anyway?
Uh, why don't we take our picture at the beach on Saturday?
Everyone's bound to look adorable.
Which beach blanket should we use for the photograph?
[gasps]
This is toasted oat and linen lamb's wool.
Eggshell, warm frost, pale nimbus, and, Well, that one is white, I suppose.
Ick.
Mwah.
The only joke is whatever this is you're playing on us, acting all nice like you're our friend.
Oh, pfft!
It's obviously a cheap knockoff of ours.
Don't hurry back, darling!
If this is your way of asking to be made The Greatest and Most Powerful, the answer is no.
And didn't we have this conversation yesterday?
I can't quite remember.
[groans]
I'll think about it.
[laughs]
Somebody's jealous.
...the sacrifice you made for us...
Anything?
Nuh-uh.
Yes.
It's not that I'm nervous, but...
Applejack, you're perfect for the job.
And, well, my resume is less apple-centric.
No missed calls while we were talking about caramel apples.
Shall we practice answering our phones and sounding calm?
One new e-mail!
Too late!
I opened mine!
They said I'm overqualified for caramel apple girl.
[gasps]
They want me to be lead parade costume designer!
Oh, pffft.
There must be a mix-up, darling.
Well, I'm not going to accept it without you, obviously.
Pfft.
Mmm, Preschool, actually.
But that's not the point.
My mind is made up.
We planned to spend the summer together, and, that's what we're going to do.
Riiiiiiiight?
Okay, if you insist!
[squeals]
I'm gonna be a costume designer!
[huffs]
You're up to three million now?
I mean, yes, uh, yes, I-I am familiar with your online repertoire.
Oof.
Magi?
You can?
[sighs]
Applejack!
Darling!
How's work on the farm?
Oh, good.
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, yes, well...
[nervous laughter]
It's certainly a big job.
Well, I-I was calling, because, you see, well, it's not that I'm, nervous or anything silly like that, but I-I-I was wondering if, if you and the girls wanted to come on opening night to see the parade.
passes!
You can cut the lines!
Applejack?
Darling?
Hello?
There you are!
Guilty as charged!
[giggles]
Hold that thought.
Vignette!
Over here!
Pfft.
Do I know her?
Why, she's my best friend at the park!
Everyone, this is Vignette Valencia.
[nervous laugh]
Heh.
So this is Sunset Shimmer, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Twilight Sparkle, and Fluttershy.
And Applejack.
I-I didn't see you.
They're my best friends.
So, I thought you'd like to meet them.
Uhhhh, fun fact, uh, we perform together in a band called the Rainbooms.
I know.
She's amazing, right?
Pfft, kuh!
Vignette will handle everything.
Did I say that?
[gasps]
Listen, tonight's a huge opportunity.
And not just for me now, but for all of us!
Honestly, I don't know why you're giving me your frowny eyebrows.
Uhhh, well, uh, enjoy the park.
I'm gonna be super-busy preparing for tonight.
So let's meet in the staging area for sound check and run-throughs.
I have three minutes' break at four o'clock, and I can give you two of them.
[laughs]
Rare, out!
Applejack, this parade is a living, breathing dance of light and sound!
Love it, lock it, stitch it.
Beautiful, perfect, I just threw up, love it.
Now hurry up!
I need these done yesterday!
Play a great show tonight?
Excuse me!
I know I am not seeing a lapped zipper on that faux fur!
A lapped zipper is simply a stuck zipper waiting to happen!
Ugh!
This is what I'm up against.
I'd love to, darling, but I am a tad super-insanely busy.
Heh.
Rain?
I didn't plan for rain!
Get me one hundred ponchos, stat!
Finished!
[sighs]
Let there be light!
[sighs]
Maybe tonight won't be a disaster after all.
[eye twitches]
Will you, uh, excuse me for a moment?
OF ALL THE OUTLANDISH CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE UNIVERSE, WHY ARE ALL THE WRETCHED THINGS HAPPENING TO ME?
I wasn't having a meltdown!
Who said I was having a meltdown?
I AM NOT HAVING A MELTDOWN!
Are you honestly asking me this right now?
We're in a giant fun park with fifty thousand people.
'Course you can't find her.
[gasps]
Fifty thousand people!
[gasps]
All looking at my costumes!
That's a hundred thousand individual eyeballs, Applejack.
SOMEBODY GET ME A BIGGER PILE OF CLOTHES TO SCREAM INTO!
One hour until wheels up, everyone!
The light parade waits for no one!
Tick-tock!
Tick-tock!
You're not worried?
Not that I'm worried.
Unless you're worried, in which case, I'm very, very worried!
Huh?
Really?
'Cause I'm feeling presh.
Why am I seeing neon pink and yellow on that dragon's tail?
Is this a beast of legend or a safety vest?
[sighs]
I suppose Applejack has better things to do than final fittings and sound check!
Do not tell me who to be annoyed with!
Where have you been?
You can explain yourself after the parade.
I'm sure?
Are you sure?
Applejack, the parade is less than an hour away, and?
Nothing's bigger than the parade, Applejack!
Applejack, admit it!
You don't care about my parade!
Is this about our friends or about you and Vignette?
Ever since she gave me this opportunity, you've been jealous because she sees my potential but she didn't hire you!
Maybe you should.
What?
What is this?
What am I looking at?
How you want it?
You said you hired me for my vision!
Vignette, wh-what is going on here?
Where are my friends?
What?
Bring back my friends this instant!
[gasps]
Hmmm.
Never underestimate a good accessory!
I can't believe I listened to you over Applejack!
Applejack!
Don't go!
You were right.
I got carried away and let this stupid parade become the only thing that mattered to me!
And I let Vignette manipulate me with false flattery into forgetting what really matters, my friends.
Stop flattering me!
I've not finished apologizing!
I'm sorry I lost sight of why we applied for jobs here in the first place.
You didn't.
Caramel apple girls to the end?
[gasps]
Our friends!
Vignette has them all trapped in the internet!
She confessed!
We have to get them out!
We have to save them!
Our friends are in that crowd!
Sweetie Belle is in that crowd!
We've got to stop her!
Someone reminded me that none of that matters without my friends.
Sorry to rain on your parade!
But I'm afraid this evening is cancelled.
Now turn off your phone and hand it over!
It's a chance to look like everything I've always wanted!
What I really want has been right in front of me the whole time!
My friends!
No amount of online success is worth it without my real life friends to share in it!
I love nothing more than someone telling me I made a perfect outfit, but I'd say you got a bit carried away.
It's not a bad thing to want to be better, but not at the expense of other people.
And especially not your friends.
Hmmm.
You've got one.
If you want.
If you're up for it.
[sighs]
Twilight, this is a most deserved respite.
We're all very thankful for the chance to relax and do absolutely nothing.
A GPS alert!
We're in international waters!
Tax-free shopping!
[laughs]
Nine ninety-nine?
[giggles]
My savvy shopping smarts strike again!
Here's ten.
Oh, you can't afford my thoughts.
Uh, Ragamuffin?
I'm Rarity.
Uh, no-no-no-no-no.
Rarity.
Close enough.
[giggles]
Hello, darlings!
[sighs]
[sighs]
It's like he fell out of a historical romance novel.
What happened to the engine?
Hello, Ragamuffin, Ragamuffin?
Are you down here?
I was just, uh, in the neighborhood, and, um, What?
Who needs electricity when you have, whatever this is?
Well, actually, in the school production of Bedazzled, I played a coal miner's daughter who danced in bedazzled magical boots from her fairy bootmother.
So, [nervous laugh]
[nervous laugh]
Aah!
And I'll inform the below-deck crew.
Even though we're from two different worlds.
One a lonely coal miner, the other a sophisticated beaut?
I mean, I'll, uh, I'll, uh, I'll help Applejack.
Ahoy, uh, matey!
Uh, this is Rarity.
Please repeat.. the words you said.
I'm beginning to wonder if, if this is no ordinary storm!
I hate this!
I'll make a new lifeboat!
Take care of yourself.
Ragamuffin, don't let anyone tell you you can't be a dancer.
For all coal turns to diamonds!
Thank you?
Wait. What?
How was the show?
I was being judgmental, darling.
What is the point of throwing shade if no one's there to catch it?
The chord progression is kind of samey-samey.
Still no excuse for lazy songwriting.
Oh, my.
Applejack, darling, anypony can do fine.
Twilight asked me, so clearly, she's going for fabulous, and fabulous takes time.
Aah!
Nono, oh no!
Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash!
It looks wretched enough already.
If you were raised in a barn!
Ahem, no offense, Applejack.
Hello, Spike.
And they are absolutely right, darling.
This festival is your brilliant idea and we know you're up to the task!
I think my bottom's on backward.
I'm not even packed!
I am ready to save Equestria!
You know what they say: where there's a city, there's a spa!
I can multitask.
Two storm bucks?
It's worth more than that!
And quite charming.
[giggles]
Quite a friend!
Ooh!
A sort of a roco-hobo-Bohemian hodgepodge.
Here you go.
I do apologize.
If we were back home, I could've done something truly fabulous.
Nothing.
After all that you've done for us, consider it a thank you.
You were, You were going to sell us?
Rats?
There's pudding?
Oh, for Celestia's sake!
Ooh!
Huh?
Thank goodness.
We had to crash the balloon at the bottom of the mountain!
That's it!
I simply, cannot, even!
I have nothing!
The bad guys have won!
I'm so sorryyyyyyyy-y-y-y!
Will you stop saying that?
[sighs]
Time to rest my hooves!
Are we sure this is the right place?
Oh, boy.
I hate epic adventures.
These fins are divine!
Ooh, ooh, That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize, we can't stay.
Well!
Look what the cat dragged in!
Himself!
Lovely!
And perfection!
Twilight, darling, are you all right?
Well, it would save time.
When will the gift exchange occur?
[chuckles]
How's your shopping going, Spike?
Which pony did you get?
I've got Applejack, darling.
She's going to adore her present.
There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan, Fedora Felt, who makes the most marvelous hats.
I asked for a new take on western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria.
I expected a package today, and I was wondering where that might be.
Uh, Rarity?
What?
It was supposed to be delivered to Rarity's Boutique!
Yes, it's for Applejack, but I will be delivering it.
It's a gift for Applejack from me.
Why is that a relief?
Uh, may I have the address for Sweet Acorn Orchard?
I think I'll just collect the package myself.
You have helped so much already.
Uh, is this Sweet Acorn Orchard?
Rarity.
Uh, pleasure.
I'm actually here about a package that was recently deliv?
[sighs]
So it did arrive!
[chuckles]
Uh, if I could just?
Thank me?
As an, acorn farmer?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, I, uh, I would be delighted.
Oh, you've been so generous.
But I must get home for a previous engagement.
I'll be keeping an eye on you, Pistachio.
I have the feeling you've got quite the future in fashion.
Oh, I don't know about most famous.
[giggles]
The hat is indeed for somepony very special.
And I couldn't bear to see him part with it.
But if I hear you call yourself a nopony again, you shan't be my guest for Fashion Week in Manehattan.
Sorry, Applejack.
Well, A little help, please!
Whoa!
[sighs]
At least Twilight has something to show for her effort.
I ordered you a fabulous farm hat, Applejack.
Alas, it decided it belonged to somepony else.
Uhhh, ooh, Something like that.
Oh, Spike.
A song is a lovely present.
Yes.
Because it looks remarkably like Applejack's barn.
But, But you created this escape room!
Two hundred thousand, seventy-four, Two hundred thousand, seventy-five, Two hundred thousand, sev, Oh, poo!
I've lost count!
One, Two...
Welcome, class.
Today, we are going to make dolls for Hearth's Warming Eve.
Hmm.
Odd.
That didn't sound like Twilight.
Well, as I was saying?
Ta indeed!
Now, if that is all, Wonderful.
As I was saying, I think you're going to find this project very?
As I was saying?
That does it!
Enough interruptions!
What are you two doing here?
Actually, if you don't mind saving them, I think we have a perfect Hearth's Warming solution for the blizzard outside.
Not again.
Oh, I'm fine, darling.
But why couldn't you try something different for once?
A chic updo will simply scream headmare!
Oh, bother.
Of course you will.
I do feel the winds of change rustling my mane.
But what to get?
Hmm, I need something spectacular!
Something, moving!
Not for long!
Oh, come on, mane!
Move!
There must be a secret to it.
Oh, poo!
[gasps]
Now that you mention it...
Actually, there was no spell.
All it takes is, a big fan!
Thank you, Spikey-Wikey.
Now, come along.
We've got things to do and ponies who need to see me!
Strange.
I've never had a horn allergy.
Oh, pity.
The glitter is simply par excellence.
How do I get it off?
Whoa!
Whoopsie!
Ugh.
This is ridiculous!
We simply must find a cure!
Well, that goes without saying, darling.
After all, Rainbow Dash is the guest of honor at the Rainbow Festival.
How dare you!
I brought the itsy-est valise!
Did somepony mention something about a spa in, where is it we're going again?
Oh, I accept that challenge.
I have so many whims.
An award for what, exactly?
I can't see anything!
And we're headed right for it!
I don't think that working!
We've arrived, and there's nopony here to greet us?
Uh, yes, please.
Could you direct us to the Hope Hollow Luxury Resort?
The room?
How rustic and charming.
Other than that she just called this place the Royal Suite?
Probably from all the dust up here.
But definitely in the top three, or would that be the bottom three?
I think they're staring because we're the only part of this town that isn't, gray.
Look around.
All the colors here are gone!
And the way they're gawking at us, it appears they think we're the odd ones.
At the Luxury Hotel.
Ugh.
None of these things are as pictured in your brochure.
We should just leave this very moment!
Hmmm, an overall stylistic look to unify the sentiment of the celebration.
That's what this festival needs.
Yes, darling, yes, yes, but more complex, more thematic, something like?
Ooh!
something like that!
Formidable!
Hmm?
That's one of my designs!
Hello?
Uh, it's just Rarity.
Uh, and I-I couldn't help but notice that you've got?
Well, thank you?
Yes, about that.
Very charming.
I do hope you don't mind my asking.
But with all this talent, why don't you simply display your own work instead of adding to others?
Hmph, au contraire.
Take this shawl.
Hoof-dyed, nicely woven, a piece of art by itself.
Imagine if you could work in color.
Like a rainbow.
How would you like to work with me as the official assistant designer of the Rainbow Festival?
Darling, if we have anything to do with it, not only will there be a festival, it will be the most stylish anypony in this town has ever seen!
Now let's get started!
You're all here!
Wonderful!
You can help us set up our cart.
Kerfuffle's official Rainbow Festival accessories.
Well, of course not, silly.
The town doesn't have any color, remember?
And look at my purple kerchief.
Isn't it divine?
Something wonderful!
Over here, darlings!
Just look what Kerfuffle has come up with!
Oh, not more karaoke, darling.
What fantastical foe awaits us, princess?
Surely you're joking.
There's a whole world out there.
Rarity, bad thing number three will not happen at the park.
Because it has already happened.
You are trapped here with me.
Bad things do not happen in threes, but you sealed your own fate by focusing on the negative rather than living in the present.
While mere seconds have passed for you and I, the outside world has aged eons!
W-W-W-W-Wait.
So I lied about this one thing.
But nopony ever hangs out with me here!
Where's my phone?
Pinkie-poo-pancake, did you lose something in that potion bottle?
Good heavens!
How will we ever get them out?
Pinkie!
Help!
Something horrid has happened!
It's almost too awful to say.
Ponyville's primary pony of propriety, Fancy Pants, has asked me to go for a stroll in the park!
Worse!
I do want to go!
Why?
Why?
Here's why.
Yesterday, I was only slightly flaunting my new headband while putting a subtle fine touch on my garden, when suddenly... Fancy Pants!
Didn't see you there.
I was just casually having some potion my friend Pinkie gave me.
Uh, would you like a sip?
I would love to!
Bad omen?
Yes!
Terribly funny!
How truly horrific!
All right, Rarity.
One bad thing happened.
Nothing to worry about.
Now, a second bad thing were to happen, and I'd really have to Whoa!
Oof!
My headband got covered in potion, Pinkie Pie.
Now it won't stop revealing deep, dark truths to me.
So, you can see why bad thing number three absolutely must happen before my rendezvous with Fancy Pants.
If it happens before the rendezvous, it won't happen at the rendezvous.
Ooooh!
This is it!
Well?
Was it bad?
Please don't fight!
What's that?
Your friendship is totally destroyed?
Over such a silly misunderstanding?
I never thought such a bad thing could happen!
Ah, well.
What can you do?
Bad things happen in threes.
And darling, I'm on strike three.
That's it!
This calls for more drastic action!
Sabotage!
You impress me yet again, Rarity, you saucy sassy girl with a mane that won't quit.
Oh, so sweet.
Thank you.
Must make the bad thing happen!
If Pinkie Pie's recipe were to suddenly disappear... that would be a bad thing.
But I can't take Pinkie's recipe.
She needs it to compete.
Not until next weekend.
You can get it back to her by then.
She will never be the wiser.
Plus, you can make it up to her later.
Hmm.
All right.
You do make a good point.
That was easier than I expected.
So it's come to this!
Come at me with your worst!
Take this!
Ugh!
So strong!
Sweet victory!
Ugh.
Huh?
Not like this!
Okay, too late.
I'm here.
Ominous, sure, but her eyeshadow's stunning!
Bravo!
Really?
Then it was all worth it.
Okay, yes.
Profound.
Whatever.
But seeing as I've already learned my lesson now, can't I still go to the park?
Oh, Applejack!
Twilight!
And even young Pinkie!
You're all here!
How long was I gone?
A week?
A century?
Oh, what a foolish filly I have been.
I suppose Fancy Pants has strolled on with another pony.
Good.
He deserves to be happy!
B-B-But!
But bad thing number three!
You sure it's just a silly superstition?
You're right!
I have been prepared for the worst.
Why not hope for the best?
What a lovely sunset.
It reminds me of the
Oh, well, uh, changing the subject
Wow.
I was so nervous about going walkies with you that I didn't realize... I don't like you.
Bad thing number three!
It's you!
To be quite frank, the most enjoyable part of the whole thing was freaking out beforehand!
Because I did it with all of you.
And I'm glad I didn't steal your souffle recipe, jeopardizing your performance and our friendship.
Nothing!
Love you!
I prefer a red carpet, but this'll do.
Darling, I'm not sure the pick-me-up is working.
What is it?
I told myself I wouldn't cry!
That mischievous miscreant didn't seem all that interested.
You can lead a draconequus, but you can't make it take a drink.
Failing isn't quite your style.
Hello, hello, everypony!
Rainbow, how's?
IT'S HORRID!
There you are, my fiery friend.
With my flair for le dramatique, I will be your inspired director!
Rainbow Dash, don't take the bait.
Cue Fluttershy!
Cue Applejack!
Bring the rage!
On your mark... get set... GOOOOOOOO!
Oh, darling, you're the absolute worst!
Heavens, no!
Majestic, that is, until it captures you!
Leaving nothing but its giant, ghastly hoofprints!
I see her!
She's breathtaking!
Oh, wait, that's me.
Well, I-I stand by my opinion.
Anypony see anything?
Oh, no!
They've been hoof-napped by Bighoof!
Darling, is it me... or have all the animals disappeared?
What if we can't find them again?
Bighoof!
Darling... this is my waiting for you face!
Device, please.
Magnifique!
And the decor still needs to be hung!
Oh, that's it!
The party's ruined!
Good grief.
I've forgotten my equipment.
Oh, you're a peach, Flutter darling.
But my equipment was for glamping.
Camping in glitz, glamour, and comfort.
Comfy mattress, a comfy bathtub, the comfy portable generator to plug in my comfy lamp – it's all very comfy!
Where?
I can't get out!
But the water rushing around me is very real!
I'm wet but alive.
Oh, wonderful news, darling.
Let me know when that's all done.
I shall be attending to my mane.
Build?
The fire?
I haven't juggled since my vaudeville days.
But I suppose I can try.
All right.
Darlings, this is one pony who is not meant for camping.
Oh, I wish I had my glamping stuff.
I wish I had my comfy mattress.
I wish I had my lamp!
But I fell in the river.
Perhaps I was born to play the part of a camper after all.
The Great Outdoors!
My eyes!
I can't see!
More layers! We need more layers!
I am on the verge of fainting at your level of detail!
That wasn't the story at all.
It was a very accurate cupcake recipe.
Ah, with pleasure and gusto.
It was a day not unlike today.
Jazz was all the rage.
I had to be at Jay's mansion on East Egg in two hours.
Little did I know, his old flame Daffodil lived across the way.
Anywho, I had no idea where my prized diamond necklace was.
Not the really good one, mind you.
The really really good one.
Ugh!
And I was retracing all of my steps, starting in the forest.
Where is my necklace?
Where?
Well, it's the story I'm telling.
I dare say, dear girl, these cupcakes are so good, I think I need to lie down.
Yes!
Here we go again...
Maybe the balloon will transform into a stage!
Ponies will gather from far and wide to watch me perform my one-pony show Lamilton!
I play a little lamb who transforms the world through song and i-lamb-ic pentameter!
Didn't expect a pelting!
Get it?
A pelt-ing?
Okay.
I'll see myself out.
Pinkie, darling, I know this taste test is a big deal, but do you think you might be overdoing it on the streamers just a teensy bit?
Speaking of, where are they?
I'm sure they have a good reason.
No, no.
Uh, it's the perfect amount of sugar.
So absolutely delectable, Pinkie.
Just divine.
There was a tiara inside?
Is it my turn?
I need a mirror.
I'm going to need to see how I
Look, Pinkie Pie.
Your cupcakes are too sweet.
Just inedible.
I can't imagine a single pony would enjoy them in all of Ponyville.
I suppose I was just trying to spare your feelings.
The truthiest truth is... I'm sorry, Pinkie.
And, well, I only lied because I don't want to hurt anypony's feelings.
Especially those of my best friends.
Oh, of course, darling!
It's going to be an unmissable, once-in-a-lifetime, extra-grand extravaganza!
I've booked the incomparable DJ Pon-3 as our musical accompaniment, and I've asked Zesty here to prepare a cosmic-sized party sub.
But it's still missing one thing.
You!
I was hoping you could use that big, beautiful noodle of yours to calculate when the comet will arrive down to the second.
All right, but if you had to?
Say, down to the second?
I knew your noodle could do it!
Come one, come all, to the pony event of the year!
The Cotton Candy Comet Festival!
Momentarily, darling.
The festival begins once the comet arrives in nine seconds!
Esteemed guests, cast your eyes upward at the magnificent splendor of the Cotton Candy Comet!
Wait for it... Wait for it... Continue to wait for it... Keep waiting for it...
Twilight!
Where's my comet?
Tomorrow?
Thank you all so much for coming to this dress rehearsal of the Cotton Candy Comet Festival.
The real festival will take place tomorrow night!
Huh?
Twilight, there you are!
I've nearly recreated my festival for this evening.
Zesty was able to prepare another delicious sandwich.
On short notice, she wasn't actually able to make it party-sized.
And I couldn't re-book DJ Pon-3, but I was able to find backup in the form of
Just keep practicing, Spike.
Everything will be fine if we know exactly when the comet will arrive.
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Cotton Candy Comet Festival!
Gaze upon the most astounding sight your pony eyes have pony-seen!
Tomorrow?
Uhhhh... Just kidding!
This was another dress rehearsal!
See you all tomorrow for the real deal!
Twilight!
You're supposed to be a genius!
Where's my comet?
Oh, Twilight.
I've been so focused on planning a festival to impress my friends that I forgot to actually be a friend.
Allow me to help you with this rascally space rock.
I know how she feels.
Some of us naturally defy expectations.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Behold!
We've cracked the code of the Cotton Candy Comet!
Absolutely, Flutter-bug.
I have faith in Twilight.
And luckily, we still have our entertainment in place.
We have some work to do.
After all of those almost-comet-arrivals, I thought my enthusiasm would've dwindled, but no.
I too am excited!
Fab-dibby-dabulous!
And just my size, too!
Oh, bobbins!
That is the grandest accessory I have ever beheld!
Ooh, magnifique!
If there's a mystery afoot, I'm your mare.
I lead the library's Dashing Dame Detective Story Hour twice a week.
Thrice, if they'll have me.
They haven't yet.
No pancakes at breakfast?
Refusing time with your friends?
The End of Equestria?
Fear not its mysterious radiance, as it will bring pure joy.
Are we filming?
Oh, get my good side.
Hah!
They're all my good sides!
Now, whatever are you up to, Flutter-loves?
Stupendous!
But this is just a topic.
You still need a way in.
An entree point.
I know!
Interview all of us!
Ask us what we think of the comet.
Be a real pony on the scene!
Comets are out of this world.
But what's in this world is my new one-pony show, Fiddler on the Hoof!
I play a musician who's afraid of heights, but I wind up on this roof, and I
Get your cakes out of the oven and into some icing!
Darling, you're so cute when you're trying to be tough.
Darling.
You haven't even touched your triple choco-loco shake.
Who are you conversing with?
I think that's enough from you!
Look what you have done!
Upsetting our sweet Miss Pie!
Okay, all right, you've got this!
My goodness, she's trying to out-adorable him!
Thank you!
Merci!
Gracias!
A piece of cake?
A piece of cake was grammar school.
A piece of cake was the last thing I ate, and it was divine.
This is live theater!
Anything is possible.
You could forget your lines.
The lights could fall.
Worst of all, you could get stage fright.
Your legs shake.
Your knees buckle.
Your mouth gets dry.
I have the most superb solution.
Tonight, I'm throwing a de-stress ball.
It's what we actors do the night before an opening night.
We chill out, get our zen on, and make all the collywobbles and worries go away.
Prepare to de-stress.
Beanbags for your bottom, candles for your comfort, and treats for your tummy.
Peppermint is a natural calmer.
I wonder who that could be.
I know who it is.
Friends, allow me to introduce Chamomilia!
She will be guiding us in relaxation techniques.
We need to breathe, Cammy...
What's gotten into you?
Yes, please tell us!
I need this bewitching brain spell gone!
You speak the truth.
You've saved opening night, Applejack!
It really did.
Now, actors, picture it.
The theater gets dark.
The curtain goes up.
A spotlight shines on theater!
It is cold out there.
Dang near freezing.
You want heat?
You want heat?
What do we look like – billionaires?
You say you want heat?
We can't even keep the lights on around here!
Don't you see?
Our possessions are keeping us down.
We need to fight materialism!
Hah!
Darlings, applause!
Party cannon!
Fanfare!
Lights!
Something amazing has happened!
You may be asking yourself, Why is Rarity – usually a pillar of chiller – so uncharacteristically over-the-top?
Glad you asked.
I am going to be a star!
Oh, thanks, darling.
But I mean a star to the great pony public!
I just shot an episode of the number-one hour-long premium cable prestige drama Hoof Session!
It's about a family of ponies vying for control of an apple farm.
And I play Greedenia P.
Bitscoin the Third, a powerful land developer.
I had an audition.
And I nailed it!
Either I buy the farm, or I simply take it from you!
It is your choice.
But I will get what's mine!
A Bitscoin always collects their debts!
And then he said to keep my schedule clear.
Which doesn't always mean you've got the part.
But then I did!
I got the part!
And I stole every scene!
Quite true.
To celebrate, I'm having a little soiree over at mine this eve to watch the ep.
Please come.
Okay, ponies.
Time to get ready.
Don't forget to dress to impress, okay?
This is a party where you will see and be seen while you see me on the screen!
End scene.
Make it big.
But not too big.
Oh, why not?
Make it too big!
Too much is always enough.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I'm just one small piece of a very large puzzle.
I feel so lucky to be part of the Hoof Session family.
What?
A six-episode arc revolving around my character?
Oh, why, I have to say yes.
So I will!
I'll say yes!
YES!
I would be nothing without you, my ponies.
Well, I would still be my fabulous self.
But I wouldn't have amazing friends around me to appreciate the fabulosity!
No talking!
Here it comes!
Here it comes!
They cut my monologue?
Go away!
I don't want visitors!
I don't want to see or be seen anymore!
You heard me!
I am a major power player, and I'm making a major play for power!
I can grow your numbers faster than you can grow apples!
And that's a Greedenia P.
Bitscoin promise!
It's a bad day as far as I'm concerned.
And I think your twin brother would agree.
This isn't the last you've seen of G.
You'll be back!
They always come back.
That was better than I did it on set.
Ohhhh, thank you.
Friends like you make me feel like a star.
Yes, please.
I must unpack before my genuine aesthetic audience member attire gets wrinkled.
So you won't be needing your bunk?
You get the top bunk, my pretties.
Darling!
Darling, I think your wing needs a sling.
Oh, I can't wait for her to open my present.
Darling, want to take a look inside my beautiful noggin?
I was at the Grand Jamboree when I
Oh, uh... this one is.
So I had just returned home from the Grand Jamboree on my birthday...
A chaise fainting couch!
Darling!
How did you?
Whenever I'm stuck on what to get somepony, I ponder the question, What did I want?
I was thinking more along the lines of a diamond necklace, designer sunglasses, or my great-great aunt's china set.
Oh, Fine.
Let's be practical and un-fun.
How about a sink?
Or a light bulb?
Or this fancy mirror?
Oh, well, I don't know how to help you!
I'm not a mind reader.
Uh, be careful.
Darling, are you certain this is a good idea?
Applejack, darling, we get it.
We're a bunch of has-beens who never do anything new.
But what are you going to do about it?
Please do not go.
Oh, she's gone.
Well, I don't know what you're all saying.
I pioneered this manecut when I did a brief stint on a very fun show about a group of companions.
The show I refer to, of course, was called Chums.
Please.
Even with my eyes closed, I'd know you were Fluttershy?
Glamour!
My darling delicate Opal!
Indeed.
Yes, yes, yes.
I have something much better than that up my sleeve.
Razzle pizzazzle!
Okay, Crusaders!
Put your hooves together for Rarity the... the... Rare!
And please welcome my beautiful, talented, humble assistant... Me!
It's me!
I'm the lovely assistant.
Now, may I have a volunteer?
There in the back!
You five!
I heard we and volunteering!
Come up!
Why, sure I'm sure.
Now kindly do me the favor of sitting on this table.
Now, when I combine these three potions... the table will disappear!
And you will all be left floating!
Presto change-o... uh... 
Magician is talking!
Disappear-o!
Where did they go?
They couldn't have gone far.
Actually, I don't know that.
They could've gone pretty far.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
Eh, what?
Uh, not now, Cutie Mark Crusaders.
I have to go and, uh... do a... a breathing exercise.
Aah!
I need a spell!
I need a spell!
If only I had some sort of a sp
A-ha!
I knew I could rely on myself!
And... the little ponies.
Disappearing, vanishing without a trace, netherverse-friend-banishing and the subsequent reversal thereof Yes!
When you don't, uh, let those around you participate, you make them disappear.
Only by including them can you bring them back.
 But I don't recall preventing them from participating!
Now I see.
I am devastated at this debacle!
I wish I'd just disa Oh!
That's it!
Girls!
I am overjoyed to see you!
What do you say we get out of this formless void and into a balanced friendship where we all share things equally?
And nobody talks over anypony else or steamrolls their ideas!
Furthermore, I think that
Sorry!
Um, how about some gardening?
And maybe a paint soiree?
I have received it!
Yes, I have received the email!
Yes!
It's right here!
And it says, Congratula-fins!
 We're the winners!
Uh... wha... Well, I...
Yes!
What should we wear?
That I can answer!
Crafting!
Yes, yes, yes.
We can show Finn Tastic the magic of our friendship or... whatever.
It's like... a precious stone that you must cherish and polish and wear to the poshest of parties.
Commence heist mode!
Let's hunt her down!
Or, you know... find her and tell her the truth.
What a glorious day.
It felt like the sunshine was set to perfection.
Ooh, we haven't had a game night in ages!
Let's play Perfect Pitch-tionary!
We just need a dictionary, a tuning fork, and a croque monsieur!
Me, darling!
I'm starving!
Okay, so what about?
Allow me.
My dramatic readings have been known to add much needed flair to any book.
Tails of Canterlot is a fast-paced role-playing adventure that can be experienced over one long weekend or several.
It is a world made up of over eight hundred classes and species.
Hmmm, yes.
Let's skip ahead.
Oh, here we are.
From here, you spend six hours speaking in front of the Council of Elders to earn your knighthood.
 Six hours?
Uh, I am no Game Master, but I've trimmed down the rules.
Do you want to give it a little 'boo when you have a mo'?
Darling, while I appreciate the drama, I feel we're ignoring your dominion over the weather and the fact that you're using it willy-nilly.
The rules might be a bit... much.
But once you get to the heart of it, you've created an amazing game.
Um, forgive me, but... where were you?
Darling!
You must make a grand romantic Ponywood epic with me as the star!
Why, Rarity, I know how to be natural on camera.
I'm just being me – the real, unvarnished Rarity!
Oh, look at the three of us working together!
Beauty vs. beast!
I'm kidding, 'cause we're all beauties.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Well, I don't want to lose.
What?
You don't audition hoping to be the understudy.
Gentle on the mane!
Aah!
My hoofness.
How long were we beauty-resting?
Darlings!
Sorry I'm late.
You know those days when you're just not feeling anything in your massive, option-filled, overflowing closet?
I have nothing to wear!
And I thought to myself, That's what's missing.
 I can put on a show with my old west chapeau!
Ooh, Rarity, you taste-making, talented trendsetter!
You've done it again!
Darling, what are you doing?
Where have you been, darling?
And where is your trademark hat?
Indeed.
Do you smell toast?
Do you need a smack?
How many hooves am I holding up?
Never mind.
Are you quite all right?
Hmm... Mind if I take a looky-loo?
The time!
I must go!
Uh, what does it do, exactly?
Know what?
Doesn't matter.
As long as it's cool.
Oh, darling.
Hats are yesterday's news, darling.
I may have let slip that there's a new trend in town.
Why, Twilight!
You say these squishy-cube things are the hottest trend since cowpony hats?
I say, tell me more!
What's that?
Everypony is talking about them?
I better go and get one!
Or a million!
IMMEDIATELY!
Applejack, darling, you're my muse.
I don't want my taste-making talents to take away your appetite for being you.
How fabulous!
You put them in order of my five-star reviews!
My, oh, my.
I don't know what she's selling, but I'm ready to buy!
Perfect!
No time to fret about that.
You've got this!
Unless you don't, in which case I am more than happy to step in.
They don't call me Ponyville's number-one understudy for nothing.
So, there I was, opening night, and my costume wasn't done being sewn yet!
But, darlings, you bet your mane I know how to improvise!
And I
Thank you!
Darling, are you all right?
Our play went over swimmingly!
Exactly as planned!
And I got three consecutive standing ovations!
Which is exactly the number my horse-oscope predicted.
Roses.
The winner's flower.
Fine.
I promise I'll share.
This sounds like a case for Detective Rarity!
I knew a mystery was ahoof when the magic made everything poof!
This mystery will be messing up our manes no more.
Then lead the way, Private Eye Pie!
We've got some ponies to prod!
Some Equestrians to question!
Some
Hmmm... You have to feel the evidence for answers, Pinkie.
Really become one with the wonders of the mystery.
Tell me... when was the last time you encountered magic on the sand?
Bobbins.
Tell me... any magical mistakes happen in here?
Do you see this, Pinkie Pie?
My bookmark's still in here from when I turned this in last week.
Also... we're one step closer to solving the mystery!
As I conducted my investigation, one thing became crystal clear.
But also, yes.
I discovered my pursuit of perplexing magical powers gone kaput was pointless!
Because the proof of the problem was present with you ponies!
Actually, I was just about to start by saying
Actually, I was just about to
Right, of course.
But, uh, I-I kind of had this whole presentation made, so if I could just
That's actually what I was getting to.
My wish was in the library.
I wished for a second sparkly bookmark, and it never came!
No, dear Twilight.
Isn't it obvious?
It was... you!
My hoofness.
It's so civilized.
But I shan't partake.
Right.
Where might our missing wishes be, Discord dear?
We'd really like to know.
If only we could get into that big, twisted noodle of a brain and find out what he's thinking.
Let's do it!
Including ours!
So we give them the tour to end all tours and start all friendships.
And now, the pièce de résistance, the prize of all Ponyville, the
Really?
I have exactly ten more titles to get through.
The tip-top of the tour!
But sometimes, keeping things simple can be the best move a pony can make.
I win!
Well, darlings, if you insist, I will sing an aria that I just happened to have prepared.
Darlings, tragedy!
I can't find my couture sunglasses!
Huh?
Are there any parasols available?
My hat and SPF don't seem to be doing the trick.
Darlings!
My sunglasses!
I lost my sunglasses!
Rarity!
Sometimes I say my own name just to remind myself how wonderful I am.
The stage is my world.
The world is my stage.
Oh, I'm sorry, Flutter dear.
What was it you were here to ask?
Wonderful.
Then you can be my audience as I rehearse.
To neigh or nay to neigh!
That is the question!
But Discord took all the wishes!
We need some emergency decorations for a surprise birthday party.
Twilight, darling, I might just have a solution.
I have a bucket full of old props somewhere.
We can use them as decor.
Here it is!
Props from The Pirates of Penprance, dino gear from Jurassic Horse... and the aliens from Independence Hay!
The party just might be saved!
What is the Meet-and-Gallop, you ask?
Why, it is only the grandest gala of the year!
The swankiest soiree!
Everypony worth their mane will be there showing off the highest fashion...
Come in, darlings!
Today, we are your personal style guides!
Wardroooooobe!
The sum of all cuteness!
Hmmm... There!
The jaunty angle.
What do you mean?
They're styled to the nines.
They don't just look like themselves.
They look great!
Darling, don't jet off just yet.
I need your opinion.
The renovations for Sugarcube Corner.
I just need your picks for the tiles, the paint, the floor, the backsplash, the counter, the fridge, the
Should just take a moment.
Don't look at me, darling.
You haven't even decided on the color palette!
Black isn't a color!
It's the absence of color!
How long was I out?
Let's go, fillies!
Not a moment to lose!
Chef, yes, chef!
We didn't even stop to consider that you had more than enough on your plate.
Literally.
Darlings, let the master work!
This is messing up my mane!
And I don't care!
Goodness.
Look at your style.
Aren't you three just a walk on the wild side?
Or maybe, for Play Day, we should actually put on a play!
The pressure's on!
What play shall we pick to perform?
Or a multi-part melodrama with a cast of at least twelve!
All right, you've twisted my hoof.
I'll play seven roles myself!
Not so fast, ponies.
This very special production will be performed... in the round!
That means both the stage and the audience are the stage!
I shall be playing Pon-tine, the innocent daughter of the banker.
And I'll also be playing Pon-tiffe, the banker.
Hmmm.
Paint – check.
Props – check.
Hmmm.
Have you seen my teapot?
As the lead star in A Neigh in the Life, I must have my teapot.
Ah, there you are.
Wait.
Is that a crack?
Alas, poor teapot!
I knew you well!
You hath brewed for me a thousand times, and now!
Oh, wait.
It was just lint.
Did you know Curtain Call, Applewood director extraordinaire, is here to debut his new play?
And he wants me to play a part in it!
My big break has finally arrived!
You're absolutely right.
I can take on both parts.
Besides, how many lines could a tree even have?
I don't think I'll have time.
I'm already busy rehearsing for both plays, and well
That's probably my agent.
I had him e-mail me my new schedule.
Hmmm... There's a bit of an overlap during rehearsal.
But nothing I shouldn't be able to handle.
I am, after all, an actor.
Oh, no!
From the top of scene five.
I am the tree.
 Oh, sorry, let me try that again.
I am the tree!
How could I be such a silly filly?
I was reading from the wrong play.
Oh, it's an update from Curtain Call.
Uh, Charity, congratulations.
Your role as Tree Number Two has been extended, and you will now be onstage for the entire play?
There's no way now I can be in both plays at once.
This big break feels more like a big headache!
Ponies, lend me your ears!
It is with great sadness that I have decided to leave our production of A Neigh in the Life.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
But Sugar Snap will be a great replacement as she's an amazing understudy.
I will now make my exit stage left.
I am the tree.
 I am the tree!
Huh?
Due to unforeseen magical events, our performance has been cancelled?
That can't be right!
Must be right.
Soooo... a funny thing happened on the way to the theater.
The Crystal Globe is reopening as an aquarium.
But even if it wasn't, I know that leaving our play was selfish of me.
And that is why I believe Sugar Snap should keep the role that I so carelessly cast aside.
And now, I shall be out of the play!
I gracefully accept.
Absolutely.
Stressed!
Yes!
Me, too!
Virtual baking, darling!
Hard, darling!
Don't you worry.
Be right there.
And by right there, I mean right after I fill these one hundred new orders and make it to the next level!
Whoo-hoo!
Cake-tacular!
Brava, darling!
Oh, maybe I should've been a little more help.
Spike, what are you talking about?
I only sent the video of Pinkie and the cupcakes to the Mane Six and you.
It couldn't have gone viral unless
What's going on with the video?
Any more action?
Yesterday, our inbox was full of fan mail.
And today, it's at zero.
Oooh!
This looks promising.
Do any of you know a prince from Neigh-geria?
He wants to give us a lot of bits!
As much as I love drama, comedy has always been my true forte.
For my first impression, I will conjure the voice of Applejack.
Ah reckon it is a beautiful day for apple-uh picking-uh.
Pickin'.
Pick-in'.
The G is silent.
Come on, Rarity.
You've been training for this.
That's mah line, dahlin'.
Darling, you must rest.
We'll take care of things around here.
Lovely.
Germy instructions.
Oh, poor Sicky Pie.
But we'll do just fine without her precious rules.
Oh, not you, too!
Home, Applejack!
Home!
Spare the rest of us.
Noooooot greeeeeeat!
Celestia!
What's that?
You're coming early?
That's completely fine!
See you soon!
What do we do?
What do we do?
If only we had written instructions on how to properly run a cupcake business!
We promise we'll read the instructions.
Just stay in bed to keep the virus from spreading!
Well, she did say to push the red lever.
So that means... Pinkie!
You look as healthy as your hologram.
Oh, no, it's fine.
I feel absolute
I will always love you, but... you've ruined me!
My mane!
We must help Pinkie Pie!
You know, darling... I once thought about getting into the biz, meaning the TV industry.
I could've been a star, too, I tell you.
But I gave it all up to focus on my suntan.
How's that turned out?
Don't ask.
Long story.
The perfect audition requires the perfect audition look.
May I?
Behold her!
Pinkie Pie – polished!
And put your best face forward!
I can't!
I simply cannot eat another bite!
Hello there, my darlings!
This is Rarity, and this, my sweet angels, is Rare Occasions with Rarity!
Thank you for subscribing!
Welcome to my one-hundredth episode!
Should I say sweet darlings and angels, or should I keep sweet angels and darlings?
I guess I can decide during the real livestream.
Sorry to interrupt, darlings, but tonight is the hundredth episode of my livestreaming solo show!
Tonight, I will be doing my all-me rendition of David Mane-et's classic, Glengrassy Glen Crop.
Which of my lovely buddies will assist please?
Where did you come from?
No, I-I meant
Um, I was thinking more a buddy I know.
Well, let's not waste another minute, Sugar Snap.
I'd love to see you at the taping.
Pinkie, you can provide refreshments if you so please.
I would love for your cakes to complement my performance.
Soooo... you are a comedienne?
Well, that sounds divine.
Uh, I'm going to do a run-through.
Would you adjust that light so I look simply radiant?
Acting!
I've been coming to this diner every day, you know?
What'll it be, Marge?
Why, yes, thank you, darling.
Now where was I?
Ah, yes.
Give me
Well, I am usually more of a
Well then, from the top!
Hello, my dear fans and friends.
I am Rarity, and thank you for coming to my one-hundredth livestream.
Tonight, I will be performing some top-notch drama.
But I won't be flying solo.
Instead, I would like to invite my good friend and rehearsal partner and the star of Coleslaw & Order, Sugar Snap!
I realize I could probably do it without you, but not if I wanted to be the best.
And I do.
Let's wow them, scene partner!
Allow me to speak for my camera-shy friends.
Each of us has been training sportacularly hard for this spectacular event and can't wait to compete.
Applejack's been training in her orchard to reach peak physique!
Twilight keeps stats to track how she's doing on the field.
And Fluttershy has devised a pump-up routine to get into the competitive spirit.
Moi?
Oh, While I do enjoy being center stage, athletics is not my forte.
Oh, darling, the only time you'll catch me with a foil is when I'm dyeing my mane!
Dearest Dash!
That résumé is for stage combat, not hoof-to-hoof athletics!
What have you signed me up for?
Oh, it's not your fault, Dash.
Even as a young filly, sports were never in the cue cards for me.
Although I did once attend a basket ball.
I brought my finest basket expecting a splendid affair.
But instead of dancing, everypony was just running back and forth throwing a ball into bottomless baskets.
Hmph!
I couldn't keep up at all.
It was positively dreadful.
And ever since then, I swore only to attend basket galas and soirees.
The only bounce I want is in my curls.
Oh, Unless it involves my mane, no, thank you.
The humidity, darling!
This one will do!
Oh, perfection!
It combines two of my loves – oration and decoration!
This calls for a celebration!
Freestyle debate ribbon-pinning has been cancelled due to... lack of interest?
But this was it.
My ideal event.
It was perfect for me.
Do not fret for me, Equestrians.
The truth is, this is not the end of my story.
I shall find a place within it, no matter what!
That's it!
I know what I can do at the Sportacular Spectacular!
Use my strongest muscle of all!
The DJ doesn't speak.
Allow me.
DJ, what events are you mixing while you are here?
Disco discus!
Should be a groovy game!
It was my pleasure.
Interview-saving is one of my résumé skills.
In fact, it seems I am perfectly qualified to join you as co-lead?
So I got the part?
You Herd it here first!
A pony never arrives unprepared.
And I'm Rarity, come to you live!
Back to you, Karen.
Agreed, darling.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not the sportiest of ponies, and even I'm having a great time.
I don't want to compete against you five.
I barely wanted to play in the first place!
But I was excited to be on a team with my besties!
It was a figure of speech, darling.
Even I know that, and I'm out on the grass as little as possible.
This isn't what friendship is all about.
I don't want to do this!
Applejack, darling, you're frozen.
Maybe you have a bad connection?
Does he need a little trim?
A little off the top can go a long way.
Look at my bangs, darling.
Fabulous.
I know.
My hoofness.
Those are quite impressive.
Don't worry.
I'm sure he's got it under control.
Perspective, darlings.
Look, you can see all of Ponyville.
Getting very small.
It would be a shame to barf on it from this height.
Down, please!
I hate to burst your bubble, dear, but no.
I have a much better idea.
Wow, Pinkie!
These dough-cup-pops look out of this world!
Well, you can!
Selfie time!
And print!
It's perfection.
Even better!
Drumroll, darlings!
The script from my episode of Hoof Session!
My monologue as Greedenia P.
Dollarsign is seared right into my memory!
So you needn't worry!
I can recite it for you all at any time!
Any time at all!
Like now.
Darling, are you all right?
Time travel?
My goodness, how can you tell?
Why, she's right.
I'm not sporting a chapeau, and neither are you.
Yes!
We're going shopping for hats!
Howdy, stranger.
My time-trottin' partner and I are hot on the trail of her missing cowgirl hat.
Without it, she's as lost as an alligator in an ice storm.
This isn't working, Applejack.
Let me try my something.
You are a real cowpony.
You're our real cowpony.
Un-hoof these innocents, outlaw!
There's no place for scoundrels like you in a time like this.
You're a thing of the past!
We are the future!
Flutter dear will be absolutely delighted.
She's been certainly mentioning this for decades.
An eternity!
A long time!
Darlings!
Did you all get Fluttershy's text?
We're too old?
Why, one is never too old to have fun.
What an honor.
Cookies are the latest trend, darling.
They're fierce!
Fun!
Flashy!
And!
No, no, no!
And I'm a complete mess about it!
I'm still miffed.
But that is cute.
Yoo-hoo!
I am sorry I'm late, darlings.
My hoofness!
Look at all of your updos!
I simply must have mine done in that style, too!
Immediately!
Now I'm stuck with a normal and boring – albeit amazing – mane.
This moment can't get any worse!
Ooh!
New notification from Princess Cadance!
Don't mind if I do!
The sparkly selfie of your updos?
Ooh, I am going to be the most fabulous pony here!
Thank you!
You've made a mess of my mane!
What have you done to me?
Hmm?
Darlings, your manes!
But they were so beautiful before.
Oh, you didn't have to do that just for me.
Sure, I wanted to be included, but I should've accepted that I was late to partake in the fancy fun.
On the bright side, at least you still have that sparkle selfie.
Princess Cadance is trotting over here.
Act cool!
But your updo was the cutting-edge of coiffure!
I would like my muzzle painted.
Even though there's clearly no improving this visage.
Seems we have not arrived at a consensus.
Hmmm... Darling, I think you're doing a top-notch job.
Just a few suggestions on the intricacies of capturing the butterfly's delicate wings.
Well, I'll just finish it myself.
Anyone around or what?
I didn't think we were gone that long.
Is she implying that I've been dillying?
Or worse – dallying?
This cannot be good!
Well, I can say that I'd love to do a little less texting and a little more talking face-to-face.
Especially with fabulous friends like you.
You certainly are, darling.
But perhaps you could put a pin in it for now?
While I am an organizing expert, remember the Marie Pondeau craze?
Joy!
Joy!
Joy!
Everything I own is gorgeous!
But I do have a fabric organizer that would be perfect for your baking tools.
I'll just pop home and get it.
Where exactly did I put that thing?
An orphaned accessory.
Where's your mommy, darling?
Hello?
Is this yours?
Shade in the front, party in the back?
You're just living your life.
Carry on!
She began to think that the head to which the visor belonged was going to be a hard head to find.
Detective Rarity is on the case.
Never fear, visor.
You'll be shading some pony's eyes in no time.
Excellent stitching.
Yes, yes, a quality item.
A-ha!
A clue!
Everything seemed to be pointing her in a certain direction.
But was it a trick?
She'd been bamboozled before.
But she didn't have the time.
She had to keep going before the trail went cold.
Say, Fluttershy?
What do you know about this visor?
Then what is this?
Don't forget to bring the visors to the moonlight stroll.
Kisses, Fluttershy.
A likely story.
Sounds like a fluff piece.
The dame and her pet seemed to be hiding something.
But Detective Rarity would not give up.
So, Miss Sparkle.
You are Fluttershy's alibi?
But what proof do you have?
So it does.
But how do you explain this?
Moonlit stroll – 11pm!
A-ha!
Gotcha!
Nopony wants the moon in their eyes!
Hmmm.
Oh, darling, it's true.
I'm so sorry.
While the dame spun her tale, it occurred to this detective that Applejack looks great in every hat.
Perhaps she would know something.
It was time to get sneaky.
Sure it was a seedy part of town.
But was Applejack really the bad apple she was looking for?
There was really only one way to get to the core of it.
I'll turn over that question to you, Miss Jack.
Is this or is this not your visor?
Another dead end.
But there was still one avenue she had yet to trot down.
The only working out I'll be doing is to the details of this case.
Where have you been for the last hour and a half?
The whole time?
A likely story.
We're only a third of the way through this routine, and it's been an hour and a half!
Okay.
Your story checks out.
Her story checked out.
The detective decided to put a pin in the case.
A pin!
The organizer!
For Pinkie!
Oh, look at all my gorgeous hats.
I wonder where my visor went.
Ohhhhh.
You've done it again!
Solved the mystery!
Hats off to you, Detective Me!
Oh, my.
Where did that come from?
That's a mystery for another day.
Darling, nopony else could be Rarity.
Who else could pull off the one-pony show Mane of Thrones?
When you play the Mane of Thrones, you win or you dye... your mane!
I've been rehearsing all day.
I need a snack.
What a delightful offer.
But I'd much prefer a real sweet treat from Sugarcube Corner.
Apples are fine, but cupcakes are divine.
Cupcakes I'm adoring, but apples give me snoring.
Cupcakes are even perfecter!
I thought we were having fun, Applejack.
But that was simply too much.
I am Rare-eesi, Mother of Dragons!
Oh, I'm sorry, too.
What made you come 'round?
That's because she is!
I'm Dear Tabby!
Yeah, you know, in the interest of
So we've heard, darling.
And pray tell, what does Ooooo do?
Are you filming something, darling?
You know, if it weren't for the going really well, I usually find that most frustrating situations are almost always helped by phoning a friend.
Oh, it wasn't easy.
It took time, patience, persistence... and, of course, scissors.
And there you have it.
Unboxing truly remains one of the great mysteries of our time.
And that's a wrap on this unboxing video.
Or as I like to call it... an unwrap!
This is a big opportunity that's knocking!
So answer the door and say yes to the dress rehearsal!
The show must go on!
Ah, friends come and go.
Should we ask her what she thinks?
Don't worry!
Just put on a happy face!
Perfect!
Think of the exposure!
One of them must happen without her.
But one-night shows are forever!
She knows the role she was born to play!
