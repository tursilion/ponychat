You dudes say somethin' about a monster hunt?
Hey, dudes, you'll never guess what I found!
Hey, look.
It's that commercial I was telling you guys about.
(Runs up, panting) What's up, Mr.
Pines!
Pines, whose birthday is it again?
Almost ready to go, Mr.
Pines.
This is it dudes, my favorite place in Gravity Falls.
Everything I know, I learned right here.
A frog taught me how to cross a street.
When my house was haunted, I learned how to eat ghosts.
And this thing taught me how to dance.
Yo, Mabel?
Can you pass me that brain in the jar?
The lady one?
There's free candy!
Pines!
We got tourists at 9 o'clock!
A whole busload of 'em!
Question.
Is it bottomless?
Pun intended?
Of course, dude.
(Sweats like crazy) Dude it's an honor.
Today I'm sweating from heat and excitement!
Hoo!
(wipes off sweat)
And yet, our mutual hatred for him bonds us together.
That was no dream, dude.
I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
That's an amazing rhyme.
When you want some, good...
When you need a Soos, you...
Oh oh, gosh, I don't know.
Dudes!
V-neck season is upon us!
Who wants to help me get ahead of the fashion curve?
I'm taking it one step further.
With a w-neck.
Must...
follow...
newspaper...
Oh, hey Dipper!
There you are!
Say ah, girl-dude.
I don't know, dude.
According to the Internet, special effects genius Harry Claymore is some kind of recluse.
Psst.
Hey, dudes!
You wanna know a trick?
Bibbity-boop.
Wop!
A genius taught me that once.
This just in: weather stations are calling for a...
candy blizzard!
Watch this.
Walking down some actual stairs.
Did it look cool?
Heh heh.
I get that a lot.
Dude!
It's the ultimate Oregon road trip adventure!
Uh, also not it.
I know, and I'm comfortable with that.
It's a dilemma, to be sure.
I couldn't help but overhear you talkin' aloud to yourself in this empty room.
Hmm.
How many brains didja see the guy eat?
Look, dude, I believe you.
I'm always noticing weird stuff in this town.
Like the mailman?
Pretty sure that dude's a werewolf.
But ya gotta have evidence.
Otherwise, people are gonna think you’re a major league cuckoo clock.
My wisdom is both a blessing and a curse.
I am needed elsewhere.
Dude, it's me: Soos.
This is for the zombies.
And this is in case you see a piñata.
Better safe than sorry!
Wassup, hambone!
Dude, you could totally use my boat for your hunt.
It's got a steering wheel, chairs; normal boat stuff.
Do any of you dudes have sunscreen?
You're a side character, then you die within the first five minutes of the movie.
Dude, am I a side character?
Do y'ever think about stuff like that?
Oh, yeah.
Dude's got a point.
Aw, dude!
Wait, lose the cameras?
Dude, I just threw two away.
Can I be associate co-captain?
Permission to taste some?
Permission associate co-granted.
Dude, I don't know what I expected that to taste like!
Dude, check it out.
Butt Island.
Dude, did you guys hear that?
Nah, my stomach normally sounds like whale noises.
Duuude, I dunno, man.
Maybe this, uh...
Maybe this isn't worth it.
All right, dudes, I'm comin'!
Dude, we should be writing this down.
Sweet!
Beaver with a chainsaw.
Ooh, yeah!
Work it!
Work it!
Nice!
Nice!
Gimme another one of those!
Yeah, I like that one.
Dude...
Get back to the boat!
HURRY!
Dude, if it makes you feel any better, I got tons of pictures of those beavers, dude!
Let's get outta here, dudes!
I still got one left!
Don't worry, dude!
Ah, beavers!
Oh, no!
Careful, dude!
Dude.
I guess the real lake monster is you two.
Heh, heh!
Sorry, that just like--boom--just popped into my head there.
Long story, dude.
Dude, am I in the frame?
So, I was cleaning up, when I found this secret door, hidden behind the wallpaper.
It's crazy bonkers creepy!
Agreed.
In my opinion: this is an ax.
Oh, you mean Manly Dan.
Yeah, he hangs out at this crazy intense biker joint downtown.
Dude, this is awesome.
You two are like: The Mystery Twins!
They're wrong!
Ohhhhh duuuude...
Hey dude, you ready to blow up these hot dogs in the microwave one by one?
I wonder what the new name will be for the power couple.
Mabideon?
Gideabel?
Magidbeleon!
Dude, wouldn't it be funny if that was a closet, and he had to come back out again and go out the real door?
Nope.
Real door.
Hit me, dude!
Feels good.
You done?
How about now?
Let's do this.
Yes, sir!
Uh, I don't think Mr.
Pines would like that.
Uhhhhh.
You're freaking me out, dude!
(Looks out window) Uhhhh.
I'm soft, like a woman.
(Appears beside Mabel, holding sandwich) Sup, hambone.
(Chews sandwich)
AAAAAAHHHH!
(Throws his sandwich in the air, and runs out of the shack, leaving the door swinging on its hinges.)
Calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more!
They got it all at the copier store!
That's not their slogan, I just really feel that way about the copier store.
You won't regret it, Mr.
Pines.
I got this book to teach me how to DJ R-R-Right!
(As DJ:)The energy, it's electric!
Uhh, lightning,  lightning, lightning, lightning...
Remember dudes, (reading from book) who ever, um, party hardies, what?
Gets the party crown!
Most applause at the end of the night wins!
I can't just give you the crown.
It's sort of a competition thing.
Let the battle for the party crown begin!
Mabel comes out strong!
Watch out, Pacifica!
Pacifica pulls ahead!
Dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside.
It is being stolen right now.
Now we're gonna bring it down for a minute.
Ladies, dudes, now's the time.
Oh man, I'm so glad I turned my head.
That dot does not disappoint.
One more song, dudes, and then it's time for the bestowing of the party crown.
It's gonna be the– Nailed it.
Let the party crown voting commence!
Applaud to vote for Mabel.
Let's check the applause meter.
Oh, oh, very good.
And the next contestant: Pacifica.
Uh-oh, a tie!
This has like, never happened before.
Ladies and gentlemen, we-we have a winner.
(Disappointed) The winner of the contest, is Pacifica Northwest.
Way ahead of you, hambone.
Found it.
The episode begins with the twins eating Corncornos inside Stan's car.
Stan is honking while Mabel attaches nachos from her chip bag to her ears.
Yeah, except for like a futuristic laser arm cannon.
Maybe some magical creature or paranormal thing-um took it.
Uh, sorry dude but you're gonna have to take your belt off for the ride.
One of your tools might fly off and accidentally fix something.
I will watch it like a hawk, dude.
Like a hawk!
...And when you look at your left, you'll see Miserable Mabel: a girl who went bonkers after her dreams were shattered by some heartless jerk.
Oh, hey, Dipper!
Let him have this.
Dude, I think I'm picking up a radio station inside my head.
He called me Big Dude once.
I mean, I know I'm a big dude, but it kinda hurt.
I don't know, Dipper.
Teenagers are dangerous.
Those hormones turn them into like, killing machines!
Oh yeah, dude.
My cousin Reggie got in a fight with a teen once.
The guy broke like, all his arms, all his legs, and I think, killed him or something, I don't know.
Me and Reggie were just talking about it.
Wimp it is.
Relax, Dipper.
Just try not to think about Robbie.
Man, I wonder what it would be like to go inside a video game for real!
I should have thought of this years ago!
Help, I'm trapped in the game!
It was cool in theory but in practice it was really boring.
It's not just a game anymore!
Uh, long story, man.
Dude, you see that video game guy tearing up everything in sight?
Ha ha!
That's crazy!
You need an amiable sidekick with a pickup truck?
Time to save the day, dude.
Don't fight him, man!
That guy's got like a black belt wrapped around his black belt.
You could get killed!
You sure you wouldn't rather hide like a wimp?
Fight like a man it is.
DUUUUUUUUDE!
Well, it was worth a shot.
Dude, we should rock paper scissors for him!
Heh!
Nice one, dude!
Alas.
Twas not but a dream.
Nom.
Nom.
Nom.
Nom.
Nom.
Eating my friends.
Nom.
Nom.
Zombie attack?
Never works, they don't take orders.
Blood rain?
Ew, mess up my suit, no thank you.
Demon Caterpillars?
DRAT!
(Shuts book) There must be a perfect way to exact vengeance on the Pines family.
It's not enough to harm 'em, I need to take something from them.
Something that'll give me ultimate power.
Wait, of course!
(Picks up his model of the Mystery Shack) It's perfect...
Thanks, but Mabel's taller.
Better check again, dude.
Yep, she's got exactly one millimeter on you!
Like some kinda alpha-twin!
Dude, maybe you should lay off a tiny bit.
N-no, I didn't mean that.
Holy hotsauce!
You've grown an extra millimeter!
(Takes off his hat of and puts on Stan's fez and looks at himself in the mirror) One day!
(puts his hat back on) Alright, something's definitely different here...
Never!
you'll never find Stan: on the second door to the left down the hall.
Wait, why did I say that?
I guess I kinda Soosed that one up, didn't I?
Am I cool?
(Holds out hand)
(Jumps on Gideon's neck) His neck is really squishy!
Hey look, I'm making fat angels.
(Falling) Tell my storyyyyy!
(Lands on carpet) Hey, there you are!
(picks up chip) Thought you could get away from me, eh corn chip?
(Takes a bite out of corn chip)
There you dudes are!
(Standing in front of some glass that he has arranged to spell HELP SOOS) I've been trying to get your attention.
Haha, this guy tells it like it is.
Ma'am, make these heads less hilarious, and you got yourself a deal.
Dude, I've never seen you guys so pumped.
Well, you dudes better be careful out there.
It's a night of ghouls and goblins.
Not to mention...
the Summerween Trickster!
The Trickster goes door to door, so the legend goes, eating children who lack the Summerween spirit.
Quiet your discontent, children, lest the Trickster overhear.
Touche...
What's goin' on out here, dudes?
I heard a ruckus.
Hehe.
That's a funny word.
Ruckus.
The Summerween Trickster!
Oh man, dude, you guys are in crazy bonkers trouble.
Dude, I'm gonna go around and grab the truck.
Soos, away!
That wasn't like, a regular pedestrian, was it?
Did everyone remember to put on their seatbelts?
Let's go!
If only there was something we could use to cover our bodies and faces with.
You know, like a disguise of some kind.
Sorry dude, today's been way too stressful.
I need some levity.
Hahaha!
This cackling head's the voice of a generation!
'Sup, bro?
Dudes, you want some of this?
Uh, sure!
You know.
Crying makes it a little weird, but, guess I'm still eating.
'Sup, Gorny?
I ate a man alive tonight.
You got it, boss!
I gave him a suggestion to improve the Shack once.
I had this idea where I could be, like, the Mystery Shack mascot: Questiony the Question Mark.
I ask people questions, you know.
Do the question dance.
Yeah, well...
Stan said I couldn't handle it.
You wanted to see us, Mr.
Pines?
He's dead?
It should have been me!
Thank you for that clarification.
Morale!
Questiony the Question Mark!
I wish this was an exclamation point to show how excited I am!
Uh, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this, Mabel.
I keep forgetting my lines.
And this costume is more um...
(steps out from behind the porta-potty, showing he only has his foam Question mark and underwear on) revealing than I expected?
But I don't know what that means.
Bu-but I...
So-so cold...
I'M QUESTIONY THE QUESTION MARK!
Aw dude, it stings so bad!
Hello?
Civilization?
Doggy?
And I actually just met this pack of wolves, and I think they're gonna like, raise me as one of their own, so I should really be at the den right now.
Uh, BT dubs, is anyone gonna eat these?
Ulcer?
You're acting...
different.
Am I a man?
Am I a baby?
These are legitimate questions.
Wait.
What did we win again?
Throwing stuff, dude.
Everyone's doin' it.
Aah!
It's some sort of invisible pushing force!
So, anyone want to scream some more?
Hey, maybe we should pass the time by telling stories.
Go on...
Dude, no offense, but it cracks so much we've already made a techno remix out of it.
Kill it!
Kill it with fire!
Everyone flee!
Well, at least before you sounded like a real person.
Now, you sound like some weird commercial dude.
Dude, you're back!
Ooh ooh!
Everything!
Yay for Soos!
Really?
Okay.
This story is called Soos' really good Pinball story.
Is that a good title?
Does it have to be a pun or whatever?
This is it, dudes.
After 4 long years of trying, I might finally get a high score on Stan's creepy old pinball machine.
If I do this, I'll go down in pinball history, with the likes of Sal, Gaff, and of course, Poo.
I don't know, dudes, isn't breaking the rules like, against the rules?
All right, that's it!
Are you ready, kids?
This is the best moment of my life.
This totally beats my old best moment.
No, that's the normal amount of green lightning.
Uh, 5 more minutes.
That's not a normal alarm clock.
Hushed exclamation of wonder!
Dude, if this is a dream, I never want to wake up!
Hey, it's the skeleton cowboy guy.
Did you zap me into your game to congratulate me on getting my new score?
I beat Poo, dude!
Well, take this!
And this!
It hurts.
I wish this was working better.
And this!
Aw, dude!
Multi-Ball!
I'm trying.
But it's hard with that gorgeous pinball wench distracting me.
Okay.
Don't worry, guys, I know every inch of this machine.
There's a manual power switch inside.
I can sneak in there and turn off the game.
But we'll have to distract the cowboy guy.
Are any of you good at jumping up and down and making annoying noises?
So are you, like, doing anything later?
Oh, right.
Okay, so I was gonna do that, but I've been thinking.
According to this, turning off the power erases the high score permanently.
That score is like my one big life accomplishment.
Fair point.
But, what is life anyway when compared to the immortality of a high score?
Uhhh Uhh.
Goodbye, high score.
Woah!
You dudes okay?
That's Okay.
I've got a new life accomplishment now.
Saving you dudes.
You think that pinball wench will call me?
Oh, sweet!
My shoes!
If we're living through that story right now, then how does it end?
What is that?
Yeah, dude.
That sounds science-y enough to be true.
It's best not to think about it.
Oh, yeah.
Word is, dude never leaves the pool.
People say he's a Mysterious loner.
You are clearly enamored.
Go to him.
It's so beautiful!
Dude, are you and Wendy having a secret staring contest?
'Cause I think you're winning
The legends that you told me in the car were true.
Inflatable duck guy, is that you?
Oh my gosh, I knew you guys were secretly alive.
I knew it!
The inflatable pool duck revolution is at hand.
I'm okay.
You got it.
You're free now!
Free!
Inflatable ducks unite!
You just gotta make your body go like a video game puzzle block.
Beebity boop boop beep beepity boop bop boop boop.
The trick is to hold perfectly still.
Ow, wait wait.
Ow, wait wait.
Ow, wait wait.
Dudes!
I found some kind of secret hidden room in the Shack!
Okay, so I was cleaning up behind this bookcase when boom!
Mystery door!
This old Shack is full of weird secrets.
Whoa!
I don't know dudes, this room gives me major, creep-o vibes.
Y'know, the attic is a pretty good space.
Maybe you two should appreciate what you got.
Heh.
Hey, what do I know?
Maybe there's nothing creepy going on in this room.
Waddles, you got it good, bro.
You got no worries.
I mean, nobody thinks it's cute when I lie naked on the living room floor.
I wish I could be a pig.
Yes!
I should do out loud wishing more often.
Is that a corn cob I spy?
I got little legs.
I wonder what frolicking adventures I'll stumble into.
A mud puddle!
Do I dare live out the cliche?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm a pig!
Oink oink, right?
Don't eat me!
I'm a man trapped in a pig's body!
Help!
Police!
Hey, that sounds pretty good!
Wait, I mean, 'NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Oh dudes!
This body's not that different from my old one.
Oh no, I changed back.
At least I think I did.
I guess being a pig wasn't that great after all.
Hey, let me get that spot you can never reach.
Wait, I don't remember anything about— Oh—alright.
Look dude, I'm playing a little bit of catch up here, I was in a pig's body for most of the day, wha, what's goin' on?
Can we kiss again, i—is that an option?
Only when I look in the mirror.
Haha, up top!
(To Gompers) Good boy.
Yeah we'll get all the babes.
You'll be fending off smooches with a stick!
(nudges Dipper)
With a stick, dude!
Oof!
Got it.
(slides down) Is sap supposed to be this sticky?
(tries to get it off)
And nothing can go wrong.
High five!
I'll go make us victory nachos.
Dipper and Soos for life!
(They fist bump and laugh.
Then Dipper goes upstairs)
Who wants victory nachos?
Dude don't worry.
I only ate like a third of them.
Half of 'em.
(Starts laughing) I ate all of them, dude!
Sorry, dude.
I was just so excited!
Nachos cause excitement!
Dude, did you see that?
That thing was a dinosaur, bro!
Did you see it, Mr.
Pines?
... Mr.
Pines?
Your pig got eaten by a pterodactyl, bro!
For Mabel!
All right!
That p-terodactyl (pronounces the p) won't know what hit him!
Actually, no one knows how to pronounce it because nobody was alive back in dinosaur days, so uh...
(straps cage to truck and nearly gets run over) Whoa!
Almost ran over my own head there!
(Laughs) Wow.
Sorry, dude.
Oh, sorry dudes, I just killed that fairy!
This is so great!
You and me, bro.
Best friends.
Fighting and potentially high-fiving dinosaurs...
Okay.
But before you do, check out these matching shirts I made for us!
(points to shirt) Who's this guy right here?
You!
Totally you, dude.
And these rays indicate friendship!
What was it you were going to tell me again?
Bros before dinos!
Huh!
This little fella smells like battery acid!
Aaaugh!
Looks like I lost my sense of smell, ha ha!
Uh, dudes...
Guys, guys, don't fight!
Why can't you be more like me and Dipper?
Look, everything's gonna be cool.
All we gotta do to find the pig is follow this here yarn!
Just keep following and following, until we reach the end!
Oh- uh oh.
Which- which cave was it again?
Hey, come on.
We'll find our way, TRUST me.
...Sorry, dude.
Look!
-What -what do you mean?
But we're p-terodactyl bros!
I made t-shirts!
I have a different body type, dude!
I like it!
I like it!
Oh, what, you want to work with Mabel but not your buddy, Soos?
Oh, wait, kid.
Pines!
Ah dude!
Did he really just eat that prospecter guy?
That is messed up!
We have to get in a straight line.
The pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart, that if you stand right in front of it, it can't see you!
Dude, look.
I-I know I've messed up a lot.
I could be sort of clumsy and..
It's not always as loveable as I think.
But please, as my friend, just trust me on this one!
Get behind me, dudes!
Bros before dinos!
(Hits the geyser hard)
A real dinosaur tooth?
That's awesome!
Pterodactyl bros.
Whoosh!
Hey!
I pronounced it right that time!
I doubt it.
I know, right?
Cancel the order, cancel the order!
Aaah!
Dudes, there's a bat in the kitchen!
It tried to touch me with its weird little bat fingers!
Swabbing on disinfectant, doo doo doo...
Dipper, Stan's personality is one of life's great mysteries.
Like whether or not it's possible to lick your own elbow.
I bet I can!
Like the infinite horizon, it eludes my grasp.
This evil triangle guy said he's gonna break into Stan's mind and steal the combination to his safe!
Also we stopped for snacks on the way here.
You think I can take these Burrito Bites into Stan's brain?
Thumbs up?
Thumbs down?
You know what, I'm just gonna bring 'em.
I wonder what Stan's thinking about right now.
I love Soos like a son!
What the?
I figured there would be more hot old ladies.
It's him!
It's the guy!
Dude!
Arm throne!
Arm throoone!
Whoa, look!
All of Stan's memories!
Let's get searching!
That doesn't seen like a good idea.
Yeah.
Let's just keep moving.
Dude, Stan, I've been meaning ask you.
Why are you so hard on Dipper all the time?
Hello?
Code to Stan's safe?
Where are you?
BORING!
Hah, we've been searching forever!
What if the triangle guy finds the memory before we do?
Yeah!
Like how he hides his arrest warrants under that rug in the gift shop?
Dude!
we found it!
Wait!
Maybe I should do it!
My big fat arms are great at destroying stuff!
Hey guys!
I just saw a memory of Stan roller skating and wearing short-shorts!
Didn't look...
didn't look that bad!
Hey, something weird is goin' on here.
Dipper, you're a cool dude, but...
this isn't cool, dude.
The Shack is safe!
So I guess he gets really mad when he gets mad.
Do you think it's actually working?
That's true.
Nightmare?
Hope he doesn't mean that British dog man I'm always dreaming about...
It's everything I've ever feared!
Ha ha, he's dead now.
Anything, huh?
Soos love stomach beam stare!
(Shoots colorful question marks from stomach and knocks Bill off)
He's talking about you!
Group hug!
I never know the right time!
Someone pinch me, dude...
So you lost the Shack.
Look on the bright side, dudes!
Now you get to live here with me, Soos!
Hey, anyone want to play race cars?
They're out of batteries but we can make pretend.
Would that be a new low if I ate that?
Haha I'm just kidding, I'm totally eating it!
If anyone asks, I'm not Soos.
Yeah especially Dipper because of his giant crush on
...you...
calyptus trees!
The kid loves eucalyptus trees!
Saved it!
Pines will figure something out.
He always does.
Go other red car!
Yeah dude, look at these faces!
Be cuter Mabel!
Your summer depends on it!
Pines!
RECONSIDER!
Sure thing, Mr.
Pines.
Since the Mystery Shack shut down, I've had to take on a bunch of part-time jobs.
Grave digger, bus driver, really awesome cook...
Hey, is the kitchen supposed to have that much fire in it?
Hey, I'm here for you, dude.
Shh, we're having a moment...
Oh hey, dudes!
Don't worry guys.
I've been a part-time bus driver for at least 40 minutes.
One of these is probably a clutch...
Hang on, dudes!
Okay.
What's closest to our present situation.
Raccoon in the engine or angry grandparent won't leave bus?
Proba-probably the second one.
Dudes!
Nooooooooooo!
Soos-ed!
Hey, Mr.
Pines, what's that code word I'm supposed to yell when I see a government vehicle?
Popodopopo!
Swag!
Man, I can't wait to smash these Stañatas!
Stay back dudes, this is about to get intense.
Sorry, one second.
You got to admit this is pretty cool.
Dudes, stay calm.
I've been training for this moment my whole life.
With all the horror movies I've seen, I literally know all there is to know about to avoid zombies.
Second thought, gonna flip the script.
Can I, eat your brains?
Yea or Nay?
Seeing some Yea faces over here.
Hoo, that's a bummer.
Good news for me though, ha ha.
Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains!
Give it up, dudes!
Your fighting only makes us look more rad!
Hey dudes!
By the way, I taught the zombies how to get into the fuse box.
Among these dudes I'm like a genius, haha!
Get those brains, dawg!
Ooh, Gossiping Housewives is on!
Eh, I already sat down.
Brains!
Braaains!
Brains!
Braaains!
Heheh, sorry dude!
Whoa ho-ho!
Oh my gosh!
A Smez despenser!
I remember these things.
What's that, yes I will have some of your old-timey face food.
Ew, dusty!
The author might still be alive, down here!
This room is way creepy.
What's goin' on, dude?
Check it out dudes!
That is so wise.
Sure are taking their time in there.
Hey, do I look smarter with this coat and brief case?
I feel like I look smarter...
The shape shifter?
Uh, dude?
Didn't Dipper say there was a monster in there with them?
YOU KNOW DIPPER'S JOKES ARE TERRIBLE!
Wendy?
Oh, it's so dark!
How will we ever find them?
Whoa, rad!
Although, isn't electric clothing kinda like a fire hazard?
We're coming for you dudes!
Maybe I am!
Mabel, inspect my shape!
Do that again!
Even better the second time!
It's not working, dude!
Let's get out of here, dudes.
Good luck sleeping tonight!
Dude, I think I'm kind of adventured out for a little while.
My face hurts from doing this all day.
Hey, who wants to get some heroes' breakfast, huh?
Mabel, you're a visionary!
I'M NOT HERE!
I'm still bummed we're no closer to finding the author guy.
At least I got his science-y coat and briefcase.
Whoa!
What the?
I bet I could get this thing fixed up in a few days.
It's gonna take a lotta duct tape.
Mutton!
And the pig can look after the house!
Woohoo!
Yeah, besides the Bermuda triangle, how mini-golf works is our world's greatest mystery.
Aw, don't give up, Mabel.
Dude, I'm cuttin' Ws into all my shirts.
Gotta give the public what they want.
Sure are a lot of stars out tonight...
Hey, got any more of those surprise tacos?
I got it, I got it, Ah!
I'm not okay!
We're heading to the theater.
Heheh, okay!
Heh, heh!
Just doing my job, hambone.
I'll see you dudes tomorrow.
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!
Walking to my car.
Punch!
Punch those leopards!
Oh, highlights are done!
You're gonna make all the other grandmas at the bingo hall so jealous!
Wait, wait.
Reggie is engaged?
But he's like the poor man's Soos.
And with grandpa!
Heh!
No problem.
I'm great at fixing stuff, playing video games, having a sort-of mustache.
I could totally get a date in a week.
Totally.
Piece of cake.
I'm dead.
A hwoman!
Alright, Soos.
You can do this.
Just use your mouth to say words that makes romance happen.
Your face is good.
I'm a Soos!
I-I think I was flirting, but I'm not sure.
Well, I kinda promised my grandma I'd get a date by the end of the week, but I've never actually been on a date before.
You belong on me, out-of-order sign.
Uuh.
But what if I embarrass myself again?
Hey there!
I'm not scared of your eyes at all!
I'm gonna look at them!
Eye contact!
Huh.
You know, I've actually been in a pig's body.
Did you know pigs have a hard time walking backwards?
Not you, though!
Not that I'm calling you a pig.
Where are you going?
So, you're probably a girl, right?
Wrong?
No, I was right the first time.
Wrong?
Could this day get any worse?
Oh no!
Cousin Reggie!
He can't see me like this!
I gotta hide!
This is it, Soos.
A lifetime of loneliness.
You're the only ones who could love me.
Fighty Hogg, Dr.
Punch Head MD.
  Huh.
Never seen that one before.
Virtually improve your dating skills.
Nine out of ten basement dwellers recommend.
 This is perfect!
So, hey there.
What's your deal?
Like to--?
Oh, she's dead!
Man, I can't wait for the year two-thousand.
Ehh, start!
When the cherry petals of magic romance academy are in bloom...
anthyding can hadplen.
 That is so true.
I'm really feeling number two, here.
Click!
I messed up.
Wow, I'm learning!
And games are making it fun.
I'd rather just click your face.
Man, this game is amazing!
I don't know why anyone abandoned it.
Boyfriend?
Oh my, .
GIFfany.
It's almost like you're actually alive.
Oh, man.
You have such a nice laugh.
So that's basically my entire life story.
Now you tell me a thing about you!
Uh, you're pretty!
And pixel-y!
And so agreeable!
O-oh hey, dudes!
Come in!
This game is amazing.
I'm making eye contact, going on dates, and I haven't seen any natural sunlight for thirteen hours!
But I'm about to meet her parents!
Her dad is an octopus-man.
I'll see you later, .
GIFfany.
I'll be back, I swear!
These girls have so many dimensions!
And no explanation-ing menus!
Oh, man!
This is the worst!
I wish I was back home with-
GIFfany!
Oh man, I'm so relieved to see you!
Although, sorta confused.
Wha-what did you do to them?
Wow, that's awesome!
Sort of a red flag, but mostly awesome!
So, what do you want to do now?
Choo choo!
Aw, man.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
I'm like, if it's fun, uh, do it.
You know?
At least you get to work at Meat Cute.
Extreme lunch meats are the food of the future.
Oh, I'm Soos.
I tell you, if you like robots for kids, you should check out the best restaurant of all time!
Oh yeah, dude.
There's one right in this mall!
I should show you some time.
Boom!
Done.
What a nice lady.
Well, back to riding this tiny train for children.
Toss it?
But, I like .
GIFfany.
She's good to me.
She's predictable.
Hey, .
GIFfany?
We, uh-- We gotta talk.
Well, have you ever had to choose between two things you like, but you don't know which one is right for you?
I mean, I'm just thinkin' long term...
Maybe I should be someone a little less beep boop.
 Heh, you know?
You- you really think so?
I don't think I like the way you're acting...
GIFfany, calm down!
Well, uh, uh...
Pause!
Woah, that got intense.
I'm sorry, .
GIFfany.
Maybe having a cursed robo-girlfriend wan't a good idea.
I'm taking you back to the video game store after my date with Melody.
Interesting!
SOOS IS!
Melody!
Are you ready for a date with me?
(Laughs) Uh, one time I was so hungry, I ate the decorational bamboo at a Chinese restaurant.
Like a big old panda!
Yeah, well, you know, I just sorta say whatever pops into my, uh...
I'm, uh, fine!
Everything's fine.
Uh, can you sit tight?
I have to go to the bathroom for a long time.
Not in a weird way.
I've got a big problem, guys.
I'm being stalked by .
GIFfany!
Or maybe it's pronouced, Jiffany?
 I was never really sure.
Don't worry.
I'm pretty sure she's stuck on TV screens.
Oh, boy.
So hey, anyway, you uh, wanna move this date far away into the forest away from all electronics and people?
No time to explain!
We gotta get out of here!
So, about all this, I may have purchased a dating simulator that obtained sentience and went crazy.
Oh no!
I'm so sorry, Melody!
I'll fix this.
It's me she wants.
I'll distract her while Dipper and Mabel keep you safe!
It's the only way!
The only WAYYYY!
Over here, .
GIFfany!
Please, let my friends go, I'll do anything, I promise!
Stay back!
I say, game over, .
GIFfany!
I'm sorry for all of this.
I honestly remember this place being a lot more fun when I was a kid.
Really?
Why would I?
Hey you aren't maybe interested in going to my cousin's engagement party in a week?
I promise there's like zero robot badgers.
Still be in town?
A relationship with a girl that I can only see through my computer...
sounds perfect!
Those people are called animators.
We're not paparazzi!
Let's escape by standing still!
It didn't work!
Huh, Mr.
Pines.
At least you finally get to work with your favorite director.
And by work, I mean suffocate inside a big wad of clay!
Dude, you conquered your fear!
And probably really expensive.
This is an impressive fight, though.
I'm glad I'm facing towards it.
Holy Toledo!
Who wants to see me change into most anything?
Do do do do do...
I can walk through walls!
Woah, woa-
Oh, you mean Straight Blanchin' by 'Lil Big Dawg?
It's the catchiest song of the summer.
Rappers are visionaries, Wendy.
If they told me to eat my own pants, I would do it.
I guess I have no choice.
Doot, do-do!
Here hillbilly-billy-billy-billy.
But the laptop has your name on it.
Hello?
Anyone here?
Guys, look!
They should've wiped off that awful mascara.
(Chuckles)
Whoa!
Touched a nerve there.
Man, you have got to teach me some of those old-man swear words.
Whoa, look at all these tubes.
People must've been getting their memories erased all over town.
Oh, dude, your memories.
We did it!
We playing Guess Who?
Dude, I know it's you, Dipper.
Such big...
strong hands....
Creepy dude who married a woodpecker?
You too?
How's that marriage goin, by the way?
Guys, if we're gonna forget everything, I got some stuff I wanna get off my chest.
Mabel, for half the summer, I thought your name was Maple, like the syrup.
No one corrected me!
Oh, nobody better miss!
Dysentery's gonna get you, dawg!
Well, time to erase that forever.
It's, like, objectively funny.
Hey, no sweat, dude.
I'd do anything for the Pines family.
And I mean anything!
Coming Mr.
Pines!
Alright, you promised a giant hummingbird, so I'm expecting to see a giant hummingbird.
I...
I...
It's uh.
It's nothing.
I, uh.
I gotta go fix a pipe or something.
Alright, guys.
Blindfold me once, shame on you.
Blindfold me twice- wait a minute.
Hot dog smell?
Sticky floors?
Future sounds?
Laser tag?
I-I love laser tag.
How'd you guys know?
I-I don't know, guys.
I'm not sure I'm up to this today.
Well, I guess I could give it a shot.
Wu-oh.
Better tie down these cowboys.
Mabel?
Dipper?
Dudes?
Dipper?
Mabel?
Requesting backup!
Ah, Ah!
Oh no!
Ah, c'mon candy.
Fall.
Fall.
Thanks, dawg.
You must be some kind of genius.
Sorry, Abuelita.
They're my cousins, grandma, gross.
Uh, sorry dude, but could you move seats?
That's the seat of honor.
Oh, heh.
It's for my dad actually.
I haven't seen him in like...
eight years.
But he's coming today!
That must be him!
Alright Soos.
Today's the big day.
Be cool.
Cool.
Sorry, champ.
Couldn't make it this year.
Real busy again.
See you next year for sure.
Dad.
Heh, yeah.
Next year.
Uh, I'm gonna go lay down.
You party without me dudes.
I don't want cookies.
I wanna see Dad again.
Busy in New Orleans...
Dipper?
Mabel?
Aw, who am I kidding?
I'm not up for this Heads I stay, tails I go make myself some dinosaur shaped cookies.
Huh.
That's...
unconventional.
G-guys!
Woah, really?
Wait, you guys did all of that...
for me?
You mean I can finally see my dad by touching this thing?
And you guys battled through time and space just to get this for me?
Alright, here goes nothing.
Bam!
I fixed you dudes up.
Well, birthdays are supposed to be spent with the people who care about you.
But you know what, that dude didn’t care about me enough to visit me once, let alone fight monsters through time and space like you dudes.
I mean, you had a gladiator fight, just to make me happy.
I've been being ridiculous this whole time.
Whoever my dad was, he can take a hike.
I know who my family is now, and it’s you dudes.
Thanks for giving me the best birthday ever.
Oh that’s not all dude.
I also wished for this slice of infinite pizza.
Watch.
And it can do that for like...
infinity.
There’s still ten minutes before Laser Tag closes.
You dudes wanna play?
Whoa.
Though I heard an explosion.
Whoa, what’s this.
Mystery Shack.
Uh, hey.
Excuse me sir.
Well, uh.
I don’t know if I--
Open to a shot of the Gravity Falls Cemetery with a partly cloudy sky, and a star-shaped cloud.
Dipper, Mabel, Wendy, Nate, Tambry, Lee, and Thompson are watching the sky and pointing at clouds.
Wait, Mr.
Pines!
I've been thinking.
Every year this festival comes by and every year you shun what could be potential customers.
You just gotta figure out what appeals to them.
Are you sure that that open flame should be that close to that dangling cloth and rope?
Oh no!
A letter rip!
Okay, gimme whatever you got that comes with a free toy.
Pines?
Is this some sort of...
possession situation?
Pines, what happened?
I heard you got arrested or something?
I had to go get some panic food.
Time for a repair guy to become a repair man.
Just put one in my mouth.
Let's do this.
Alright Soos, remember the plan.
Protect the machine, earn Stan's trust, legally get adopted by Stan, change name to Stan Junior.
Ahh!
Oh, kids!
Where've you been?
Stan gave me a mission to protect this machine!
And I thought I loved snacks.
Guys, I know this seems crazy, but I promised Stan I would guard this with my life.
Aah!
Attack glitter!
It's pretty, but it hurts!
Aww, c'mon, I don't wanna fight you guys!
This hurts me more than it hurts you!
Seriously, it hurts me way more that it hurts you!
It's like something from a video game...
I don't understand.
Why would Mr.
Pines have all this?
But what is it doing underneath the Mystery Shack?
Maybe he's the author.
It's the final countdown!
Just like they always sung about!
Sorry, Mr.
Pines - if that is your real name - but I have a new mission now!
Protecting these kids!
Ohoho, I am so on it, dude.
I hope all this aligns exactly with my fanfic, Stan.
If not, I will be very disappointed.
Aw, man.
I was so spellbound by your dramatic tale I forgot all about those dudes.
I'll just...
let myself out.
Wendy, I've got something amazing to tell you.
Clear the next fourteen hours!
Okay, okay, so it turns out that the second Stan, the Stan that, we know, was actually, Stanley but the first Stan, was Stanford, but we didn't know, until, that Stanford came out of the portal, which was built by Stanford, but then Stanley pretended to be Stanford, he, did the portal, cause he's Stan, but he's not Stan.
Okay, okay, I understand.
Anyway, act two: Stan started...
Aw, sorry, Dipper, I don't go in for that pen and paper kind of stuff.
I'm more of an FCLORPer.
FCLORP: Foam and Cardboard Legitimate Outdoor Role Play.
It is where a passionate brethren of craftsman, bring their dreams to magical reality.
Let yon priestess go, elf-mage!
Heheh.
Sorry, dude, but it is kinda nerdy.
Well, I'm off to lay siege to a goblin fortress.
To my grandma's backYARD!
I predicted that, like, a year ago.
I'm kinda- I'm kinda tired.
Long day.
Long day of FCLORPing.
I dunno, dude, it's not like we have a lot of good mayor options.
Everyone in this town is a tad strange.
Except, ironically, Tad Strange.
Whoa, thanks for the slamming tie, dudes!
These stripes are so slimming!
Guys!
Something weird just happened.
I'm really freaked out!
Oh my gosh!
My life just flashed before my eyes!
Aghh!
Yeah!
How'd you do it, Mr.
Pines?
Hey, a little help dudes?
I accidentally got my head stuck in my shirt sleeve.
I guess this is my life now.
I don't know much about taxes, but I can promise you a kitten in every pot!
That doesn't make sense, Mabel.
You don't make sense, Dipper!
That was a fun 78 hours.
What do ya say, dude?
You comin'?
Yeah, dude.
And a road trip's the perfect place to meet new people.
Guys?
Hello?
Anyone?
They'll come back for me.
Okay, Soos.
Remember what your grandma taught you.
When you get lost, stay exactly where you are, and don't move.
(pause) Don't...
move...
(pause) You know, I would make a really good scarecrow.
In one week, my grandma is finally letting me eat crackers on my bed!
The future is coming for us all, dudes.
Boom, dreams comin' true!
Dude, you could rent out the Gravity Falls High School gym, and have your party there.
That place is empty all summer long.
Hey, I know what'll make you feel better.
Let's deliver some invites to your friends, huh?
Abuelita!
A tidal wave of madness just went over us!
You've turned into a chair!
But what about you?
And my friends?
When the universe is broken, only one handyman can fix it.
I'm coming for you, friends!
Heya, Dipper.
How's it hanging?
Handyman of the apocalypse, at your service.
I've been wandering the plains like a desperado, helping strangers.
I guess there's some folk songs about me now?
Let me see what the damage is, here.
Ah, well the good news is: your arm is okay.
Bad news is we're surrounded, dudes.
Whew!
And I thought I was gonna have to throw down!
Whatever it is, we'll do it together.
For Mabel!
Guys, if I die, I wanna die hugging.
Let my body be your shield!
And does the air smell like childlike wonder?
What is this new world?
Shining, shimmering, splendid.
Yeah, I haven't eaten anything except for part of my hat for the last three days.
Someone hand me some syrup.
Hang in there, Mabel!
Up you go, little lady.
Don't mind if I-
I'm sorry, I can't leave him hanging!
Yus!
Dude, calm down; Dippy Fresh didn't do anything to you, dawg.
Pudding center.
Nice!
Don't worry, dude.
There's nothing in this world that could break me from our mission.
Holy- whoa, whoa.
Dad?
You're perfect!
I'm sorry, dude.
Even if it is all a dream, I've gotta play just one game.
Hahaha!
Come on, Dad!
It was him.
We've missed you, Mabel.
Did Bill already win?
Let's get 'em, dudes.
Pines!
It's really you!
I've been hugging strangers to practice for this moment.
Don't worry, Ford!
We're coming for you!
Question, does it have any gun-swords?
I watch a lot of anime and, uh, trust me, you're gonna want some gun-swords.
We have much to discuss.
Idiots!
Thanks for these apocalypse sweaters, Mabel.
The end of the world has never been so comfortable.
Hey, if we're lucky enough to get there, I guarantee this whole town is gonna throw you the best birthday party you've ever seen.
It's the Shacktron, dude!
Uh, hey, dudes.
Is this thing on?
Test Heh.
Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes to hand over Ford or we'll have to, like, fight and junk.
Heh.
Hey, you're a little cutie.
Whoa.
I liked you better before you talked.
Real...
real bring down, this guy.
All right, dudes!
(Runs into the Shack)
The question mark.
This one's unsolvable.
Skip to my page!
He needs to remember our boss-employee relationship.
Dude!
Make a wish, dawg.
So how do you feel?
You shut down your mouth for good!
I'm sorry, Mr.
Pines.
It's just that this shack is the most magical place on Earth.
Sure, the attractions are all fake, but dreams aren't fake!
Like, this mermaid.
It's not just a dead fish butt sewn to a monkey carcass.
It's a marvelous creature that makes us believe that anything is possible.
You shut down this shack, and you shut down our dreams!
At least...
my dreams.
You...
you mean it, Mr.
Mystery?
Hey, can you punch my heart, too?
What?
But it's like eighty-something degrees out today.
You dudes say somethin' about a monster hunt?
Hey, dudes, you'll never guess what I found!
Hey, look.
It's that commercial I was telling you guys about.
(Runs up, panting) What's up, Mr.
Pines!
Pines, whose birthday is it again?
Almost ready to go, Mr.
Pines.
This is it dudes, my favorite place in Gravity Falls.
Everything I know, I learned right here.
A frog taught me how to cross a street.
When my house was haunted, I learned how to eat ghosts.
And this thing taught me how to dance.
Yo, Mabel?
Can you pass me that brain in the jar?
The lady one?
There's free candy!
Pines!
We got tourists at 9 o'clock!
A whole busload of 'em!
Question.
Is it bottomless?
Pun intended?
Of course, dude.
(Sweats like crazy) Dude it's an honor.
Today I'm sweating from heat and excitement!
Hoo!
(wipes off sweat)
And yet, our mutual hatred for him bonds us together.
That was no dream, dude.
I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
That's an amazing rhyme.
When you want some, good...
When you need a Soos, you...
Oh oh, gosh, I don't know.
Dudes!
V-neck season is upon us!
Who wants to help me get ahead of the fashion curve?
I'm taking it one step further.
With a w-neck.
Must...
follow...
newspaper...
Oh, hey Dipper!
There you are!
Say ah, girl-dude.
I don't know, dude.
According to the Internet, special effects genius Harry Claymore is some kind of recluse.
Psst.
Hey, dudes!
You wanna know a trick?
Bibbity-boop.
Wop!
A genius taught me that once.
This just in: weather stations are calling for a...
candy blizzard!
Watch this.
Walking down some actual stairs.
Did it look cool?
Heh heh.
I get that a lot.
Dude!
It's the ultimate Oregon road trip adventure!
Uh, also not it.
I know, and I'm comfortable with that.
It's a dilemma, to be sure.
I couldn't help but overhear you talkin' aloud to yourself in this empty room.
Hmm.
How many brains didja see the guy eat?
Look, dude, I believe you.
I'm always noticing weird stuff in this town.
Like the mailman?
Pretty sure that dude's a werewolf.
But ya gotta have evidence.
Otherwise, people are gonna think you’re a major league cuckoo clock.
My wisdom is both a blessing and a curse.
I am needed elsewhere.
Dude, it's me: Soos.
This is for the zombies.
And this is in case you see a piñata.
Better safe than sorry!
Wassup, hambone!
Dude, you could totally use my boat for your hunt.
It's got a steering wheel, chairs; normal boat stuff.
Do any of you dudes have sunscreen?
You're a side character, then you die within the first five minutes of the movie.
Dude, am I a side character?
Do y'ever think about stuff like that?
Oh, yeah.
Dude's got a point.
Aw, dude!
Wait, lose the cameras?
Dude, I just threw two away.
Can I be associate co-captain?
Permission to taste some?
Permission associate co-granted.
Dude, I don't know what I expected that to taste like!
Dude, check it out.
Butt Island.
Dude, did you guys hear that?
Nah, my stomach normally sounds like whale noises.
Duuude, I dunno, man.
Maybe this, uh...
Maybe this isn't worth it.
All right, dudes, I'm comin'!
Dude, we should be writing this down.
Sweet!
Beaver with a chainsaw.
Ooh, yeah!
Work it!
Work it!
Nice!
Nice!
Gimme another one of those!
Yeah, I like that one.
Dude...
Get back to the boat!
HURRY!
Dude, if it makes you feel any better, I got tons of pictures of those beavers, dude!
Let's get outta here, dudes!
I still got one left!
Don't worry, dude!
Ah, beavers!
Oh, no!
Careful, dude!
Dude.
I guess the real lake monster is you two.
Heh, heh!
Sorry, that just like--boom--just popped into my head there.
Long story, dude.
Dude, am I in the frame?
So, I was cleaning up, when I found this secret door, hidden behind the wallpaper.
It's crazy bonkers creepy!
Agreed.
In my opinion: this is an ax.
Oh, you mean Manly Dan.
Yeah, he hangs out at this crazy intense biker joint downtown.
Dude, this is awesome.
You two are like: The Mystery Twins!
They're wrong!
Ohhhhh duuuude...
Hey dude, you ready to blow up these hot dogs in the microwave one by one?
I wonder what the new name will be for the power couple.
Mabideon?
Gideabel?
Magidbeleon!
Dude, wouldn't it be funny if that was a closet, and he had to come back out again and go out the real door?
Nope.
Real door.
Hit me, dude!
Feels good.
You done?
How about now?
Let's do this.
Yes, sir!
Uh, I don't think Mr.
Pines would like that.
Uhhhhh.
You're freaking me out, dude!
(Looks out window) Uhhhh.
I'm soft, like a woman.
(Appears beside Mabel, holding sandwich) Sup, hambone.
(Chews sandwich)
AAAAAAHHHH!
(Throws his sandwich in the air, and runs out of the shack, leaving the door swinging on its hinges.)
Calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more!
They got it all at the copier store!
That's not their slogan, I just really feel that way about the copier store.
You won't regret it, Mr.
Pines.
I got this book to teach me how to DJ R-R-Right!
(As DJ:)The energy, it's electric!
Uhh, lightning,  lightning, lightning, lightning...
Remember dudes, (reading from book) who ever, um, party hardies, what?
Gets the party crown!
Most applause at the end of the night wins!
I can't just give you the crown.
It's sort of a competition thing.
Let the battle for the party crown begin!
Mabel comes out strong!
Watch out, Pacifica!
Pacifica pulls ahead!
Dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside.
It is being stolen right now.
Now we're gonna bring it down for a minute.
Ladies, dudes, now's the time.
Oh man, I'm so glad I turned my head.
That dot does not disappoint.
One more song, dudes, and then it's time for the bestowing of the party crown.
It's gonna be the– Nailed it.
Let the party crown voting commence!
Applaud to vote for Mabel.
Let's check the applause meter.
Oh, oh, very good.
And the next contestant: Pacifica.
Uh-oh, a tie!
This has like, never happened before.
Ladies and gentlemen, we-we have a winner.
(Disappointed) The winner of the contest, is Pacifica Northwest.
Way ahead of you, hambone.
Found it.
The episode begins with the twins eating Corncornos inside Stan's car.
Stan is honking while Mabel attaches nachos from her chip bag to her ears.
Yeah, except for like a futuristic laser arm cannon.
Maybe some magical creature or paranormal thing-um took it.
Uh, sorry dude but you're gonna have to take your belt off for the ride.
One of your tools might fly off and accidentally fix something.
I will watch it like a hawk, dude.
Like a hawk!
...And when you look at your left, you'll see Miserable Mabel: a girl who went bonkers after her dreams were shattered by some heartless jerk.
Oh, hey, Dipper!
Let him have this.
Dude, I think I'm picking up a radio station inside my head.
He called me Big Dude once.
I mean, I know I'm a big dude, but it kinda hurt.
I don't know, Dipper.
Teenagers are dangerous.
Those hormones turn them into like, killing machines!
Oh yeah, dude.
My cousin Reggie got in a fight with a teen once.
The guy broke like, all his arms, all his legs, and I think, killed him or something, I don't know.
Me and Reggie were just talking about it.
Wimp it is.
Relax, Dipper.
Just try not to think about Robbie.
Man, I wonder what it would be like to go inside a video game for real!
I should have thought of this years ago!
Help, I'm trapped in the game!
It was cool in theory but in practice it was really boring.
It's not just a game anymore!
Uh, long story, man.
Dude, you see that video game guy tearing up everything in sight?
Ha ha!
That's crazy!
You need an amiable sidekick with a pickup truck?
Time to save the day, dude.
Don't fight him, man!
That guy's got like a black belt wrapped around his black belt.
You could get killed!
You sure you wouldn't rather hide like a wimp?
Fight like a man it is.
DUUUUUUUUDE!
Well, it was worth a shot.
Dude, we should rock paper scissors for him!
Heh!
Nice one, dude!
Alas.
Twas not but a dream.
Nom.
Nom.
Nom.
Nom.
Nom.
Eating my friends.
Nom.
Nom.
Zombie attack?
Never works, they don't take orders.
Blood rain?
Ew, mess up my suit, no thank you.
Demon Caterpillars?
DRAT!
(Shuts book) There must be a perfect way to exact vengeance on the Pines family.
It's not enough to harm 'em, I need to take something from them.
Something that'll give me ultimate power.
Wait, of course!
(Picks up his model of the Mystery Shack) It's perfect...
Thanks, but Mabel's taller.
Better check again, dude.
Yep, she's got exactly one millimeter on you!
Like some kinda alpha-twin!
Dude, maybe you should lay off a tiny bit.
N-no, I didn't mean that.
Holy hotsauce!
You've grown an extra millimeter!
(Takes off his hat of and puts on Stan's fez and looks at himself in the mirror) One day!
(puts his hat back on) Alright, something's definitely different here...
Never!
you'll never find Stan: on the second door to the left down the hall.
Wait, why did I say that?
I guess I kinda Soosed that one up, didn't I?
Am I cool?
(Holds out hand)
(Jumps on Gideon's neck) His neck is really squishy!
Hey look, I'm making fat angels.
(Falling) Tell my storyyyyy!
(Lands on carpet) Hey, there you are!
(picks up chip) Thought you could get away from me, eh corn chip?
(Takes a bite out of corn chip)
There you dudes are!
(Standing in front of some glass that he has arranged to spell HELP SOOS) I've been trying to get your attention.
Haha, this guy tells it like it is.
Ma'am, make these heads less hilarious, and you got yourself a deal.
Dude, I've never seen you guys so pumped.
Well, you dudes better be careful out there.
It's a night of ghouls and goblins.
Not to mention...
the Summerween Trickster!
The Trickster goes door to door, so the legend goes, eating children who lack the Summerween spirit.
Quiet your discontent, children, lest the Trickster overhear.
Touche...
What's goin' on out here, dudes?
I heard a ruckus.
Hehe.
That's a funny word.
Ruckus.
The Summerween Trickster!
Oh man, dude, you guys are in crazy bonkers trouble.
Dude, I'm gonna go around and grab the truck.
Soos, away!
That wasn't like, a regular pedestrian, was it?
Did everyone remember to put on their seatbelts?
Let's go!
If only there was something we could use to cover our bodies and faces with.
You know, like a disguise of some kind.
Sorry dude, today's been way too stressful.
I need some levity.
Hahaha!
This cackling head's the voice of a generation!
'Sup, bro?
Dudes, you want some of this?
Uh, sure!
You know.
Crying makes it a little weird, but, guess I'm still eating.
'Sup, Gorny?
I ate a man alive tonight.
You got it, boss!
I gave him a suggestion to improve the Shack once.
I had this idea where I could be, like, the Mystery Shack mascot: Questiony the Question Mark.
I ask people questions, you know.
Do the question dance.
Yeah, well...
Stan said I couldn't handle it.
You wanted to see us, Mr.
Pines?
He's dead?
It should have been me!
Thank you for that clarification.
Morale!
Questiony the Question Mark!
I wish this was an exclamation point to show how excited I am!
Uh, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this, Mabel.
I keep forgetting my lines.
And this costume is more um...
(steps out from behind the porta-potty, showing he only has his foam Question mark and underwear on) revealing than I expected?
But I don't know what that means.
Bu-but I...
So-so cold...
I'M QUESTIONY THE QUESTION MARK!
Aw dude, it stings so bad!
Hello?
Civilization?
Doggy?
And I actually just met this pack of wolves, and I think they're gonna like, raise me as one of their own, so I should really be at the den right now.
Uh, BT dubs, is anyone gonna eat these?
Ulcer?
You're acting...
different.
Am I a man?
Am I a baby?
These are legitimate questions.
Wait.
What did we win again?
Throwing stuff, dude.
Everyone's doin' it.
Aah!
It's some sort of invisible pushing force!
So, anyone want to scream some more?
Hey, maybe we should pass the time by telling stories.
Go on...
Dude, no offense, but it cracks so much we've already made a techno remix out of it.
Kill it!
Kill it with fire!
Everyone flee!
Well, at least before you sounded like a real person.
Now, you sound like some weird commercial dude.
Dude, you're back!
Ooh ooh!
Everything!
Yay for Soos!
Really?
Okay.
This story is called Soos' really good Pinball story.
Is that a good title?
Does it have to be a pun or whatever?
This is it, dudes.
After 4 long years of trying, I might finally get a high score on Stan's creepy old pinball machine.
If I do this, I'll go down in pinball history, with the likes of Sal, Gaff, and of course, Poo.
I don't know, dudes, isn't breaking the rules like, against the rules?
All right, that's it!
Are you ready, kids?
This is the best moment of my life.
This totally beats my old best moment.
No, that's the normal amount of green lightning.
Uh, 5 more minutes.
That's not a normal alarm clock.
Hushed exclamation of wonder!
Dude, if this is a dream, I never want to wake up!
Hey, it's the skeleton cowboy guy.
Did you zap me into your game to congratulate me on getting my new score?
I beat Poo, dude!
Well, take this!
And this!
It hurts.
I wish this was working better.
And this!
Aw, dude!
Multi-Ball!
I'm trying.
But it's hard with that gorgeous pinball wench distracting me.
Okay.
Don't worry, guys, I know every inch of this machine.
There's a manual power switch inside.
I can sneak in there and turn off the game.
But we'll have to distract the cowboy guy.
Are any of you good at jumping up and down and making annoying noises?
So are you, like, doing anything later?
Oh, right.
Okay, so I was gonna do that, but I've been thinking.
According to this, turning off the power erases the high score permanently.
That score is like my one big life accomplishment.
Fair point.
But, what is life anyway when compared to the immortality of a high score?
Uhhh Uhh.
Goodbye, high score.
Woah!
You dudes okay?
That's Okay.
I've got a new life accomplishment now.
Saving you dudes.
You think that pinball wench will call me?
Oh, sweet!
My shoes!
If we're living through that story right now, then how does it end?
What is that?
Yeah, dude.
That sounds science-y enough to be true.
It's best not to think about it.
Oh, yeah.
Word is, dude never leaves the pool.
People say he's a Mysterious loner.
You are clearly enamored.
Go to him.
It's so beautiful!
Dude, are you and Wendy having a secret staring contest?
'Cause I think you're winning
The legends that you told me in the car were true.
Inflatable duck guy, is that you?
Oh my gosh, I knew you guys were secretly alive.
I knew it!
The inflatable pool duck revolution is at hand.
I'm okay.
You got it.
You're free now!
Free!
Inflatable ducks unite!
You just gotta make your body go like a video game puzzle block.
Beebity boop boop beep beepity boop bop boop boop.
The trick is to hold perfectly still.
Ow, wait wait.
Ow, wait wait.
Ow, wait wait.
Dudes!
I found some kind of secret hidden room in the Shack!
Okay, so I was cleaning up behind this bookcase when boom!
Mystery door!
This old Shack is full of weird secrets.
Whoa!
I don't know dudes, this room gives me major, creep-o vibes.
Y'know, the attic is a pretty good space.
Maybe you two should appreciate what you got.
Heh.
Hey, what do I know?
Maybe there's nothing creepy going on in this room.
Waddles, you got it good, bro.
You got no worries.
I mean, nobody thinks it's cute when I lie naked on the living room floor.
I wish I could be a pig.
Yes!
I should do out loud wishing more often.
Is that a corn cob I spy?
I got little legs.
I wonder what frolicking adventures I'll stumble into.
A mud puddle!
Do I dare live out the cliche?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm a pig!
Oink oink, right?
Don't eat me!
I'm a man trapped in a pig's body!
Help!
Police!
Hey, that sounds pretty good!
Wait, I mean, 'NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Oh dudes!
This body's not that different from my old one.
Oh no, I changed back.
At least I think I did.
I guess being a pig wasn't that great after all.
Hey, let me get that spot you can never reach.
Wait, I don't remember anything about— Oh—alright.
Look dude, I'm playing a little bit of catch up here, I was in a pig's body for most of the day, wha, what's goin' on?
Can we kiss again, i—is that an option?
Only when I look in the mirror.
Haha, up top!
(To Gompers) Good boy.
Yeah we'll get all the babes.
You'll be fending off smooches with a stick!
(nudges Dipper)
With a stick, dude!
Oof!
Got it.
(slides down) Is sap supposed to be this sticky?
(tries to get it off)
And nothing can go wrong.
High five!
I'll go make us victory nachos.
Dipper and Soos for life!
(They fist bump and laugh.
Then Dipper goes upstairs)
Who wants victory nachos?
Dude don't worry.
I only ate like a third of them.
Half of 'em.
(Starts laughing) I ate all of them, dude!
Sorry, dude.
I was just so excited!
Nachos cause excitement!
Dude, did you see that?
That thing was a dinosaur, bro!
Did you see it, Mr.
Pines?
... Mr.
Pines?
Your pig got eaten by a pterodactyl, bro!
For Mabel!
All right!
That p-terodactyl (pronounces the p) won't know what hit him!
Actually, no one knows how to pronounce it because nobody was alive back in dinosaur days, so uh...
(straps cage to truck and nearly gets run over) Whoa!
Almost ran over my own head there!
(Laughs) Wow.
Sorry, dude.
Oh, sorry dudes, I just killed that fairy!
This is so great!
You and me, bro.
Best friends.
Fighting and potentially high-fiving dinosaurs...
Okay.
But before you do, check out these matching shirts I made for us!
(points to shirt) Who's this guy right here?
You!
Totally you, dude.
And these rays indicate friendship!
What was it you were going to tell me again?
Bros before dinos!
Huh!
This little fella smells like battery acid!
Aaaugh!
Looks like I lost my sense of smell, ha ha!
Uh, dudes...
Guys, guys, don't fight!
Why can't you be more like me and Dipper?
Look, everything's gonna be cool.
All we gotta do to find the pig is follow this here yarn!
Just keep following and following, until we reach the end!
Oh- uh oh.
Which- which cave was it again?
Hey, come on.
We'll find our way, TRUST me.
...Sorry, dude.
Look!
-What -what do you mean?
But we're p-terodactyl bros!
I made t-shirts!
I have a different body type, dude!
I like it!
I like it!
Oh, what, you want to work with Mabel but not your buddy, Soos?
Oh, wait, kid.
Pines!
Ah dude!
Did he really just eat that prospecter guy?
That is messed up!
We have to get in a straight line.
The pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart, that if you stand right in front of it, it can't see you!
Dude, look.
I-I know I've messed up a lot.
I could be sort of clumsy and..
It's not always as loveable as I think.
But please, as my friend, just trust me on this one!
Get behind me, dudes!
Bros before dinos!
(Hits the geyser hard)
A real dinosaur tooth?
That's awesome!
Pterodactyl bros.
Whoosh!
Hey!
I pronounced it right that time!
I doubt it.
I know, right?
Cancel the order, cancel the order!
Aaah!
Dudes, there's a bat in the kitchen!
It tried to touch me with its weird little bat fingers!
Swabbing on disinfectant, doo doo doo...
Dipper, Stan's personality is one of life's great mysteries.
Like whether or not it's possible to lick your own elbow.
I bet I can!
Like the infinite horizon, it eludes my grasp.
This evil triangle guy said he's gonna break into Stan's mind and steal the combination to his safe!
Also we stopped for snacks on the way here.
You think I can take these Burrito Bites into Stan's brain?
Thumbs up?
Thumbs down?
You know what, I'm just gonna bring 'em.
I wonder what Stan's thinking about right now.
I love Soos like a son!
What the?
I figured there would be more hot old ladies.
It's him!
It's the guy!
Dude!
Arm throne!
Arm throoone!
Whoa, look!
All of Stan's memories!
Let's get searching!
That doesn't seen like a good idea.
Yeah.
Let's just keep moving.
Dude, Stan, I've been meaning ask you.
Why are you so hard on Dipper all the time?
Hello?
Code to Stan's safe?
Where are you?
BORING!
Hah, we've been searching forever!
What if the triangle guy finds the memory before we do?
Yeah!
Like how he hides his arrest warrants under that rug in the gift shop?
Dude!
we found it!
Wait!
Maybe I should do it!
My big fat arms are great at destroying stuff!
Hey guys!
I just saw a memory of Stan roller skating and wearing short-shorts!
Didn't look...
didn't look that bad!
Hey, something weird is goin' on here.
Dipper, you're a cool dude, but...
this isn't cool, dude.
The Shack is safe!
So I guess he gets really mad when he gets mad.
Do you think it's actually working?
That's true.
Nightmare?
Hope he doesn't mean that British dog man I'm always dreaming about...
It's everything I've ever feared!
Ha ha, he's dead now.
Anything, huh?
Soos love stomach beam stare!
(Shoots colorful question marks from stomach and knocks Bill off)
He's talking about you!
Group hug!
I never know the right time!
Someone pinch me, dude...
So you lost the Shack.
Look on the bright side, dudes!
Now you get to live here with me, Soos!
Hey, anyone want to play race cars?
They're out of batteries but we can make pretend.
Would that be a new low if I ate that?
Haha I'm just kidding, I'm totally eating it!
If anyone asks, I'm not Soos.
Yeah especially Dipper because of his giant crush on
...you...
calyptus trees!
The kid loves eucalyptus trees!
Saved it!
Pines will figure something out.
He always does.
Go other red car!
Yeah dude, look at these faces!
Be cuter Mabel!
Your summer depends on it!
Pines!
RECONSIDER!
Sure thing, Mr.
Pines.
Since the Mystery Shack shut down, I've had to take on a bunch of part-time jobs.
Grave digger, bus driver, really awesome cook...
Hey, is the kitchen supposed to have that much fire in it?
Hey, I'm here for you, dude.
Shh, we're having a moment...
Oh hey, dudes!
Don't worry guys.
I've been a part-time bus driver for at least 40 minutes.
One of these is probably a clutch...
Hang on, dudes!
Okay.
What's closest to our present situation.
Raccoon in the engine or angry grandparent won't leave bus?
Proba-probably the second one.
Dudes!
Nooooooooooo!
Soos-ed!
Hey, Mr.
Pines, what's that code word I'm supposed to yell when I see a government vehicle?
Popodopopo!
Swag!
Man, I can't wait to smash these Stañatas!
Stay back dudes, this is about to get intense.
Sorry, one second.
You got to admit this is pretty cool.
Dudes, stay calm.
I've been training for this moment my whole life.
With all the horror movies I've seen, I literally know all there is to know about to avoid zombies.
Second thought, gonna flip the script.
Can I, eat your brains?
Yea or Nay?
Seeing some Yea faces over here.
Hoo, that's a bummer.
Good news for me though, ha ha.
Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains!
Give it up, dudes!
Your fighting only makes us look more rad!
Hey dudes!
By the way, I taught the zombies how to get into the fuse box.
Among these dudes I'm like a genius, haha!
Get those brains, dawg!
Ooh, Gossiping Housewives is on!
Eh, I already sat down.
Brains!
Braaains!
Brains!
Braaains!
Heheh, sorry dude!
Whoa ho-ho!
Oh my gosh!
A Smez despenser!
I remember these things.
What's that, yes I will have some of your old-timey face food.
Ew, dusty!
The author might still be alive, down here!
This room is way creepy.
What's goin' on, dude?
Check it out dudes!
That is so wise.
Sure are taking their time in there.
Hey, do I look smarter with this coat and brief case?
I feel like I look smarter...
The shape shifter?
Uh, dude?
Didn't Dipper say there was a monster in there with them?
YOU KNOW DIPPER'S JOKES ARE TERRIBLE!
Wendy?
Oh, it's so dark!
How will we ever find them?
Whoa, rad!
Although, isn't electric clothing kinda like a fire hazard?
We're coming for you dudes!
Maybe I am!
Mabel, inspect my shape!
Do that again!
Even better the second time!
It's not working, dude!
Let's get out of here, dudes.
Good luck sleeping tonight!
Dude, I think I'm kind of adventured out for a little while.
My face hurts from doing this all day.
Hey, who wants to get some heroes' breakfast, huh?
Mabel, you're a visionary!
I'M NOT HERE!
I'm still bummed we're no closer to finding the author guy.
At least I got his science-y coat and briefcase.
Whoa!
What the?
I bet I could get this thing fixed up in a few days.
It's gonna take a lotta duct tape.
Mutton!
And the pig can look after the house!
Woohoo!
Yeah, besides the Bermuda triangle, how mini-golf works is our world's greatest mystery.
Aw, don't give up, Mabel.
Dude, I'm cuttin' Ws into all my shirts.
Gotta give the public what they want.
Sure are a lot of stars out tonight...
Hey, got any more of those surprise tacos?
I got it, I got it, Ah!
I'm not okay!
We're heading to the theater.
Heheh, okay!
Heh, heh!
Just doing my job, hambone.
I'll see you dudes tomorrow.
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!
Walking to my car.
Punch!
Punch those leopards!
Oh, highlights are done!
You're gonna make all the other grandmas at the bingo hall so jealous!
Wait, wait.
Reggie is engaged?
But he's like the poor man's Soos.
And with grandpa!
Heh!
No problem.
I'm great at fixing stuff, playing video games, having a sort-of mustache.
I could totally get a date in a week.
Totally.
Piece of cake.
I'm dead.
A hwoman!
Alright, Soos.
You can do this.
Just use your mouth to say words that makes romance happen.
Your face is good.
I'm a Soos!
I-I think I was flirting, but I'm not sure.
Well, I kinda promised my grandma I'd get a date by the end of the week, but I've never actually been on a date before.
You belong on me, out-of-order sign.
Uuh.
But what if I embarrass myself again?
Hey there!
I'm not scared of your eyes at all!
I'm gonna look at them!
Eye contact!
Huh.
You know, I've actually been in a pig's body.
Did you know pigs have a hard time walking backwards?
Not you, though!
Not that I'm calling you a pig.
Where are you going?
So, you're probably a girl, right?
Wrong?
No, I was right the first time.
Wrong?
Could this day get any worse?
Oh no!
Cousin Reggie!
He can't see me like this!
I gotta hide!
This is it, Soos.
A lifetime of loneliness.
You're the only ones who could love me.
Fighty Hogg, Dr.
Punch Head MD.
  Huh.
Never seen that one before.
Virtually improve your dating skills.
Nine out of ten basement dwellers recommend.
 This is perfect!
So, hey there.
What's your deal?
Like to--?
Oh, she's dead!
Man, I can't wait for the year two-thousand.
Ehh, start!
When the cherry petals of magic romance academy are in bloom...
anthyding can hadplen.
 That is so true.
I'm really feeling number two, here.
Click!
I messed up.
Wow, I'm learning!
And games are making it fun.
I'd rather just click your face.
Man, this game is amazing!
I don't know why anyone abandoned it.
Boyfriend?
Oh my, .
GIFfany.
It's almost like you're actually alive.
Oh, man.
You have such a nice laugh.
So that's basically my entire life story.
Now you tell me a thing about you!
Uh, you're pretty!
And pixel-y!
And so agreeable!
O-oh hey, dudes!
Come in!
This game is amazing.
I'm making eye contact, going on dates, and I haven't seen any natural sunlight for thirteen hours!
But I'm about to meet her parents!
Her dad is an octopus-man.
I'll see you later, .
GIFfany.
I'll be back, I swear!
These girls have so many dimensions!
And no explanation-ing menus!
Oh, man!
This is the worst!
I wish I was back home with-
GIFfany!
Oh man, I'm so relieved to see you!
Although, sorta confused.
Wha-what did you do to them?
Wow, that's awesome!
Sort of a red flag, but mostly awesome!
So, what do you want to do now?
Choo choo!
Aw, man.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
I'm like, if it's fun, uh, do it.
You know?
At least you get to work at Meat Cute.
Extreme lunch meats are the food of the future.
Oh, I'm Soos.
I tell you, if you like robots for kids, you should check out the best restaurant of all time!
Oh yeah, dude.
There's one right in this mall!
I should show you some time.
Boom!
Done.
What a nice lady.
Well, back to riding this tiny train for children.
Toss it?
But, I like .
GIFfany.
She's good to me.
She's predictable.
Hey, .
GIFfany?
We, uh-- We gotta talk.
Well, have you ever had to choose between two things you like, but you don't know which one is right for you?
I mean, I'm just thinkin' long term...
Maybe I should be someone a little less beep boop.
 Heh, you know?
You- you really think so?
I don't think I like the way you're acting...
GIFfany, calm down!
Well, uh, uh...
Pause!
Woah, that got intense.
I'm sorry, .
GIFfany.
Maybe having a cursed robo-girlfriend wan't a good idea.
I'm taking you back to the video game store after my date with Melody.
Interesting!
SOOS IS!
Melody!
Are you ready for a date with me?
(Laughs) Uh, one time I was so hungry, I ate the decorational bamboo at a Chinese restaurant.
Like a big old panda!
Yeah, well, you know, I just sorta say whatever pops into my, uh...
I'm, uh, fine!
Everything's fine.
Uh, can you sit tight?
I have to go to the bathroom for a long time.
Not in a weird way.
I've got a big problem, guys.
I'm being stalked by .
GIFfany!
Or maybe it's pronouced, Jiffany?
 I was never really sure.
Don't worry.
I'm pretty sure she's stuck on TV screens.
Oh, boy.
So hey, anyway, you uh, wanna move this date far away into the forest away from all electronics and people?
No time to explain!
We gotta get out of here!
So, about all this, I may have purchased a dating simulator that obtained sentience and went crazy.
Oh no!
I'm so sorry, Melody!
I'll fix this.
It's me she wants.
I'll distract her while Dipper and Mabel keep you safe!
It's the only way!
The only WAYYYY!
Over here, .
GIFfany!
Please, let my friends go, I'll do anything, I promise!
Stay back!
I say, game over, .
GIFfany!
I'm sorry for all of this.
I honestly remember this place being a lot more fun when I was a kid.
Really?
Why would I?
Hey you aren't maybe interested in going to my cousin's engagement party in a week?
I promise there's like zero robot badgers.
Still be in town?
A relationship with a girl that I can only see through my computer...
sounds perfect!
Those people are called animators.
We're not paparazzi!
Let's escape by standing still!
It didn't work!
Huh, Mr.
Pines.
At least you finally get to work with your favorite director.
And by work, I mean suffocate inside a big wad of clay!
Dude, you conquered your fear!
And probably really expensive.
This is an impressive fight, though.
I'm glad I'm facing towards it.
Holy Toledo!
Who wants to see me change into most anything?
Do do do do do...
I can walk through walls!
Woah, woa-
Oh, you mean Straight Blanchin' by 'Lil Big Dawg?
It's the catchiest song of the summer.
Rappers are visionaries, Wendy.
If they told me to eat my own pants, I would do it.
I guess I have no choice.
Doot, do-do!
Here hillbilly-billy-billy-billy.
But the laptop has your name on it.
Hello?
Anyone here?
Guys, look!
They should've wiped off that awful mascara.
(Chuckles)
Whoa!
Touched a nerve there.
Man, you have got to teach me some of those old-man swear words.
Whoa, look at all these tubes.
People must've been getting their memories erased all over town.
Oh, dude, your memories.
We did it!
We playing Guess Who?
Dude, I know it's you, Dipper.
Such big...
strong hands....
Creepy dude who married a woodpecker?
You too?
How's that marriage goin, by the way?
Guys, if we're gonna forget everything, I got some stuff I wanna get off my chest.
Mabel, for half the summer, I thought your name was Maple, like the syrup.
No one corrected me!
Oh, nobody better miss!
Dysentery's gonna get you, dawg!
Well, time to erase that forever.
It's, like, objectively funny.
Hey, no sweat, dude.
I'd do anything for the Pines family.
And I mean anything!
Coming Mr.
Pines!
Alright, you promised a giant hummingbird, so I'm expecting to see a giant hummingbird.
I...
I...
It's uh.
It's nothing.
I, uh.
I gotta go fix a pipe or something.
Alright, guys.
Blindfold me once, shame on you.
Blindfold me twice- wait a minute.
Hot dog smell?
Sticky floors?
Future sounds?
Laser tag?
I-I love laser tag.
How'd you guys know?
I-I don't know, guys.
I'm not sure I'm up to this today.
Well, I guess I could give it a shot.
Wu-oh.
Better tie down these cowboys.
Mabel?
Dipper?
Dudes?
Dipper?
Mabel?
Requesting backup!
Ah, Ah!
Oh no!
Ah, c'mon candy.
Fall.
Fall.
Thanks, dawg.
You must be some kind of genius.
Sorry, Abuelita.
They're my cousins, grandma, gross.
Uh, sorry dude, but could you move seats?
That's the seat of honor.
Oh, heh.
It's for my dad actually.
I haven't seen him in like...
eight years.
But he's coming today!
That must be him!
Alright Soos.
Today's the big day.
Be cool.
Cool.
Sorry, champ.
Couldn't make it this year.
Real busy again.
See you next year for sure.
Dad.
Heh, yeah.
Next year.
Uh, I'm gonna go lay down.
You party without me dudes.
I don't want cookies.
I wanna see Dad again.
Busy in New Orleans...
Dipper?
Mabel?
Aw, who am I kidding?
I'm not up for this Heads I stay, tails I go make myself some dinosaur shaped cookies.
Huh.
That's...
unconventional.
G-guys!
Woah, really?
Wait, you guys did all of that...
for me?
You mean I can finally see my dad by touching this thing?
And you guys battled through time and space just to get this for me?
Alright, here goes nothing.
Bam!
I fixed you dudes up.
Well, birthdays are supposed to be spent with the people who care about you.
But you know what, that dude didn’t care about me enough to visit me once, let alone fight monsters through time and space like you dudes.
I mean, you had a gladiator fight, just to make me happy.
I've been being ridiculous this whole time.
Whoever my dad was, he can take a hike.
I know who my family is now, and it’s you dudes.
Thanks for giving me the best birthday ever.
Oh that’s not all dude.
I also wished for this slice of infinite pizza.
Watch.
And it can do that for like...
infinity.
There’s still ten minutes before Laser Tag closes.
You dudes wanna play?
Whoa.
Though I heard an explosion.
Whoa, what’s this.
Mystery Shack.
Uh, hey.
Excuse me sir.
Well, uh.
I don’t know if I--
Open to a shot of the Gravity Falls Cemetery with a partly cloudy sky, and a star-shaped cloud.
Dipper, Mabel, Wendy, Nate, Tambry, Lee, and Thompson are watching the sky and pointing at clouds.
Wait, Mr.
Pines!
I've been thinking.
Every year this festival comes by and every year you shun what could be potential customers.
You just gotta figure out what appeals to them.
Are you sure that that open flame should be that close to that dangling cloth and rope?
Oh no!
A letter rip!
Okay, gimme whatever you got that comes with a free toy.
Pines?
Is this some sort of...
possession situation?
Pines, what happened?
I heard you got arrested or something?
I had to go get some panic food.
Time for a repair guy to become a repair man.
Just put one in my mouth.
Let's do this.
Alright Soos, remember the plan.
Protect the machine, earn Stan's trust, legally get adopted by Stan, change name to Stan Junior.
Ahh!
Oh, kids!
Where've you been?
Stan gave me a mission to protect this machine!
And I thought I loved snacks.
Guys, I know this seems crazy, but I promised Stan I would guard this with my life.
Aah!
Attack glitter!
It's pretty, but it hurts!
Aww, c'mon, I don't wanna fight you guys!
This hurts me more than it hurts you!
Seriously, it hurts me way more that it hurts you!
It's like something from a video game...
I don't understand.
Why would Mr.
Pines have all this?
But what is it doing underneath the Mystery Shack?
Maybe he's the author.
It's the final countdown!
Just like they always sung about!
Sorry, Mr.
Pines - if that is your real name - but I have a new mission now!
Protecting these kids!
Ohoho, I am so on it, dude.
I hope all this aligns exactly with my fanfic, Stan.
If not, I will be very disappointed.
Aw, man.
I was so spellbound by your dramatic tale I forgot all about those dudes.
I'll just...
let myself out.
Wendy, I've got something amazing to tell you.
Clear the next fourteen hours!
Okay, okay, so it turns out that the second Stan, the Stan that, we know, was actually, Stanley but the first Stan, was Stanford, but we didn't know, until, that Stanford came out of the portal, which was built by Stanford, but then Stanley pretended to be Stanford, he, did the portal, cause he's Stan, but he's not Stan.
Okay, okay, I understand.
Anyway, act two: Stan started...
Aw, sorry, Dipper, I don't go in for that pen and paper kind of stuff.
I'm more of an FCLORPer.
FCLORP: Foam and Cardboard Legitimate Outdoor Role Play.
It is where a passionate brethren of craftsman, bring their dreams to magical reality.
Let yon priestess go, elf-mage!
Heheh.
Sorry, dude, but it is kinda nerdy.
Well, I'm off to lay siege to a goblin fortress.
To my grandma's backYARD!
I predicted that, like, a year ago.
I'm kinda- I'm kinda tired.
Long day.
Long day of FCLORPing.
I dunno, dude, it's not like we have a lot of good mayor options.
Everyone in this town is a tad strange.
Except, ironically, Tad Strange.
Whoa, thanks for the slamming tie, dudes!
These stripes are so slimming!
Guys!
Something weird just happened.
I'm really freaked out!
Oh my gosh!
My life just flashed before my eyes!
Aghh!
Yeah!
How'd you do it, Mr.
Pines?
Hey, a little help dudes?
I accidentally got my head stuck in my shirt sleeve.
I guess this is my life now.
I don't know much about taxes, but I can promise you a kitten in every pot!
That doesn't make sense, Mabel.
You don't make sense, Dipper!
That was a fun 78 hours.
What do ya say, dude?
You comin'?
Yeah, dude.
And a road trip's the perfect place to meet new people.
Guys?
Hello?
Anyone?
They'll come back for me.
Okay, Soos.
Remember what your grandma taught you.
When you get lost, stay exactly where you are, and don't move.
(pause) Don't...
move...
(pause) You know, I would make a really good scarecrow.
In one week, my grandma is finally letting me eat crackers on my bed!
The future is coming for us all, dudes.
Boom, dreams comin' true!
Dude, you could rent out the Gravity Falls High School gym, and have your party there.
That place is empty all summer long.
Hey, I know what'll make you feel better.
Let's deliver some invites to your friends, huh?
Abuelita!
A tidal wave of madness just went over us!
You've turned into a chair!
But what about you?
And my friends?
When the universe is broken, only one handyman can fix it.
I'm coming for you, friends!
Heya, Dipper.
How's it hanging?
Handyman of the apocalypse, at your service.
I've been wandering the plains like a desperado, helping strangers.
I guess there's some folk songs about me now?
Let me see what the damage is, here.
Ah, well the good news is: your arm is okay.
Bad news is we're surrounded, dudes.
Whew!
And I thought I was gonna have to throw down!
Whatever it is, we'll do it together.
For Mabel!
Guys, if I die, I wanna die hugging.
Let my body be your shield!
And does the air smell like childlike wonder?
What is this new world?
Shining, shimmering, splendid.
Yeah, I haven't eaten anything except for part of my hat for the last three days.
Someone hand me some syrup.
Hang in there, Mabel!
Up you go, little lady.
Don't mind if I-
I'm sorry, I can't leave him hanging!
Yus!
Dude, calm down; Dippy Fresh didn't do anything to you, dawg.
Pudding center.
Nice!
Don't worry, dude.
There's nothing in this world that could break me from our mission.
Holy- whoa, whoa.
Dad?
You're perfect!
I'm sorry, dude.
Even if it is all a dream, I've gotta play just one game.
Hahaha!
Come on, Dad!
It was him.
We've missed you, Mabel.
Did Bill already win?
Let's get 'em, dudes.
Pines!
It's really you!
I've been hugging strangers to practice for this moment.
Don't worry, Ford!
We're coming for you!
Question, does it have any gun-swords?
I watch a lot of anime and, uh, trust me, you're gonna want some gun-swords.
We have much to discuss.
Idiots!
Thanks for these apocalypse sweaters, Mabel.
The end of the world has never been so comfortable.
Hey, if we're lucky enough to get there, I guarantee this whole town is gonna throw you the best birthday party you've ever seen.
It's the Shacktron, dude!
Uh, hey, dudes.
Is this thing on?
Test Heh.
Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes to hand over Ford or we'll have to, like, fight and junk.
Heh.
Hey, you're a little cutie.
Whoa.
I liked you better before you talked.
Real...
real bring down, this guy.
All right, dudes!
(Runs into the Shack)
The question mark.
This one's unsolvable.
Skip to my page!
He needs to remember our boss-employee relationship.
Dude!
Make a wish, dawg.
So how do you feel?
You shut down your mouth for good!
I'm sorry, Mr.
Pines.
It's just that this shack is the most magical place on Earth.
Sure, the attractions are all fake, but dreams aren't fake!
Like, this mermaid.
It's not just a dead fish butt sewn to a monkey carcass.
It's a marvelous creature that makes us believe that anything is possible.
You shut down this shack, and you shut down our dreams!
At least...
my dreams.
You...
you mean it, Mr.
Mystery?
Hey, can you punch my heart, too?
What?
But it's like eighty-something degrees out today.
