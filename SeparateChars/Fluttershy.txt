Oh my.
Um, stop please, everyone, umm.
Excuse me, sir?
I mean no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off.
Now, follow me, please.
A-one, a-two, a-one two three-
[yelp]
Um...
I'm Fluttershy.
Um...
My name is Fluttershy.
[gasp]
A baby dragon!
Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before.
He's sooo cute!
Oh my, he talks.
I didn't know dragons could talk.
That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!
Wait, wait!
What's his name?
Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy.
Wow, a talking dragon!
And what do dragons talk about?
Absolutely everything.
Oh, yes, please!
Poor thing, you simply must get into bed...
Ready?
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
Sorry girls.
I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait!
WAIT!
Shhh...
It's okay.
Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
Now this might hurt for just a second.
[giggles]
Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you?
Yes you are, yes you are.
I didn't.
Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
[scream]
Why Rarity, it's so lovely.
Your necklace.
It looks just like your cutie mark.
[gasp]
[gasp]
Angel, these are perfect.
Um, excuse me, Twilight.
I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else--
Oh, no.
I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of.
You see, it's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance.
The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria.
For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom...
and that's just the flora!
Don't get me started on the fauna.
There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my!
Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz.
White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!
Oh, well, hello Twilight.
I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
Oh, well, better late than never, right?
It was Angel's idea.
Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend.
Right, Angel?
Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
Me too.
I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
Twilight?
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season.
She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
Dizzy?
Oh Applejack!
Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.
They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
Okay, little bunnies!
I need you to all gather here in the middle.
Applejack!
Winona!
Stop!
You're scaring them.
Oh no.
Oh my.
Oh...
Please stop, little bunnies.
Oh no!
Please, let's go home.
Oh my goodness.
All right little ones, this way, this way.
Mama duck, you're free and clear.
Please excuse me.
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
I-I-I was just trying to...
B-b-b-but I...
I...
[bleat]
[sobs]
Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.
Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda.
Umm...
Do you really think it's a good idea?
I mean?
I'm a year older than you.
[spits]
Not too fast now, Angel Bunny.
You don't wanna get a tummy ache.
[chuckles]
You really should eat more than that, don't you think?
It's not play time yet.
I know you want to run, but...
just three more bites.
Two more bites?
One more bite?
Pretty please?
[sighs]
Oh, goodness.
Are you okay?
Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
Because you need some water?
[gasp]
Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke?
I'll take that as a...
yes.
Help.
Help!
Please?
Help?
There's- there's a horrible cloud of smoke.
It's headed this way and- [shrieks]
Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration.
This is a time for panic, for-
There's- there's smoke.
And- and where there's smoke, there's fire.
And-
We're all going to have to start over, in a new village.
'Cause ours is gonna be-
Oh, please, this is an emergency.
I-I need everypony to-
That's what I've been trying to-
Oh, thank goodness.
A...
d-dragon?
[gasp]
Um, actually...
[squeak]
Um, let's...
not?
[squeak]
M-m-mountain?
[gulp]
Um, excuse me, Twilight?
I know you're busy, but...
But if I could just have a second...
So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville.
Good.
I'll stay here and-
I don't think I-
I don't really think he's up to the task.
Maybe...
but...
but...
[squeak]
[squeal]
But...
but...
[scream]
[gasp]
It- it's so...
high!
I-it's so...
so...
steep.
Oh...
okay.
[soft cry]
[whimpers]
[soft grunts]
[squeals]
[gulp]
But...
it's so...
wide.
I don't know.
O-okay.
Here I go.
A hop.
Skip.
[whimpers]
I guess I forgot to jump.
An...
an ava...
ava...
AVALA-!
[sigh]
Sorry.
[sigh]
[whimpers]
[whimper]
I- I- I can't go in the cave.
I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of [mumble]
I'm scared of [mumble]
I'm scared of dragons!
[squeal]
Yes, because they're not dragons.
Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!
[whimper]
I was afraid to.
I- I- I just...
can't.
How dare you...
How dare you!
Listen here, mister.
Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully!
You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire.
But you do not?
I repeat?
you do not!
Hurt!
Friends!
You got that?
Well?
And I am very sorry about that.
But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better.
You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
Don't you 'but I' me, mister.
Now what do you have to say for yourself?
I said, what do you have to say for yourself?
There, there.
No need to cry.
You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision.
Now go pack your things.
You just need to find a new place to sleep.
That's all.
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.
Not everypony can be as brave as me.
[scream]
She's mysterious.
Animals care for themselves...
And then, she digs at the ground.
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
The door's open.
... it's a curse.
I don't want to talk about it.
Uh, I don't know.
Seems awfully dangerous.
Oopsie!
Sorry.
Uh...
Spike?
Are you coming?
[sigh]
You made me sound ridiculous!
And the chanting?
... Yes.
La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia.
Only the prettiest ones will do.
La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
Gah!
Hello, little guy.
I've never seen anything like you before.
Oh, are you hungry?
Here you go.
[gasp]
I guess you were hungry.
You're the cutest thing ever!
I can't wait to show you to my friends.
Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe...
oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, am I interrupting?
You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest.
Come on out, little guy.
It's okay.
[gasp]
Three?
I'm not sure.
I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
Pinkie, do you want the other one?
Ugh?
How could you not like...
I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
What do we do?
Ouch.
[gasps]
Well, I may have kept just one.
Heh.
I couldn't help myself.
They're just so cute.
What do we do?
They're eating all the food in town.
Wake up, little sleepy heads.
Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.
Aren't they?
This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.
It's like a long sleep.
Yes.
[bell rings]
Wake up, little porcupines.
Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.
Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens?
I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.
You will?
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Good morning, friends.
Wait.
My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
No, you simply must wait.
Stop.
Stop.
STOP!
No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly.
[gasp]
It's...
nice.
Oh, Rarity.
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
Hello?
You wanted to see me, Rarity?
I...
love it.
No, no.
I do.
It's...
nice.
Nice.
Oh, but I do like it.
Um...
both?
Please stop asking me this, I...
No, that's okay...
No...
it's fine...
I...
like it...
All right!
Since you really wanna know...
[inhales]
The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch, and the overdesign is reminiscent of prˆt-…-porter and not true French haute couture.
[pauses]
But, uh...
you know...
um, whatever you want to do is fine.
French haute couture, please.
It's...
perfect!
Uh...
panic?
Do you like it?
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.
You okay, Twilight Sparkle?
I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg.
Bye-bye!
Of course.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
A hop, skip, and a... jump!
Loss of control.
Screaming and hollering.
Passion!
[inhales]
Yay.
Yay.
Yay.
[deep breath]
Yaaay.
Too loud?
Yay.
Wooo.
Way to go.
Rainbow Dash, you rock!
Woohoo.
[gasp]
Did my cheering do that?
Actually, it wasn't all bad.
I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
Were we arguing?
I'm sorry.
Yay.
She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it.
I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.
Now wait just a minute!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to be more assertive.
Anyhow...
She is going to do a sonic rainboom!
Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself!
...If you're free.
Did you see that?
I was so assertive!
But Rainbow Dash, just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.
Rare...
Rarity?
It's incredible!
Uhh...
C'mon, girls.
Why don't we go see how clouds are made?
Don't listen to them.
You're gonna win that competition for sure!
My favorite is number ten.
She just looked like such a nice pony.
Look!
Phase two is working.
Oh, I can't look!
A sonic rainboom!
She did it!
She did it!
Wooo!
A sonic rainboom!
Wooo!
Yeah!
It's okay.
Oh, sorry.
I thought the open sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken.
No worries, Rarity.
I've left her there in the basket.
Oh, no!
I wouldn't!
I couldn't!
I-I don't really have any control over when that happens.
I-It just happens.
No, I'm just good with animals.
It's my special gift, you know?
[gasp]
These are lovely, but twenty by tonight?
How will you get it all done?
Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.
What does that patch on your cape mean?
I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night.
Oh, it's no problem at all.
Did I have a problem with Opal?
You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
Come on, it'll be fun.
These sweet little angels?
So cute.
W-wait for me!
Oh, won't this be ever so fun?
We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and?
Hello, Twilight.
Where are you off to?
Th-The Everfree Forest?
Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?
Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
What?
These sweet little angels?
They'll be no problem at all.
No... problem at all.
Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?
Girls?
Should we?
Girls, okay, now settle?
I-I know you're excited, but?
girls, oh, oh, careful with the?
oh, ah, girls?
[huffs]
What do you wanna do?
Play a game?
Mmm, I don't know...
how about a nice quiet little tea party?
Oh, no!
The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous.
It's filled with far too many strange creatures.
Um, oh, maybe that's not such a?
now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring?
Doh?
Careful...
you don't...
...break anything.
Oh, girls, it's okay.
C-carpenters?
Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?
It's called Shhh!
Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest.
Sound fun?
I'm the world champ, you know.
I bet you can't beat me!
[squee]
[deep breath]
[sigh]
I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think?
Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
Um, okay, um.
Maybe the crusading can wait until morning?
When it's light?
And not so...
dark?
[blows out candle]
Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
How about I sing you a lullaby?
[clears throat]
Oh, how wonderful!
Why don't you sing it with me?
Okay Sweetie, that was...
Thank you Sweetie, um...
[gasp]
Girls!
No, I don't think that's a?
ah, come back!
Please!
Come on, girls, the chickens are fine?
oh, girls, um...
girls!
Come on, in you go.
There's some good chickens.
Okay, you three.
Isn't it about time you got into bed?
Please?
So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
Okay, good night.
[sigh]
It really wasn't that hard ...
I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge.
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy!
Good with animals, good with kids.
Mmm, peace and quiet.
[gasps]
Too quiet.
[gasps]
Girls?
Girls?
Elizabeak!
She's missing!
Girls?
[gasps]
Oh, no!
They must have gone looking for my missing chicken!
Which means...
they must have gone into...
[gasp]
[gulp]
The Everfree Forest!
Those girls have really done it this time!
They've really bitten off more than they can chew!
Oh, just like me!
I never should have offered to watch them.
[deep breath]
Girls?
[gulp]
Girls?
[tiny terrified squeak]
Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy.
Just put one hoof in front of the other.
Ahh!
What was that?
[scream]
Twilight?
I-Is that you?
Oh, Twilight, it is you.
Thank goodness you're here.
I need your help.
The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're?
[gasps]
What's happened to you?
[scream]
Oh, no!
If you've been turned to stone, it must mean?
Oh no, the girls!
Don't move.
I'll be back for you.
Girls!
Girls?
Girls?
Girls!
Thank goodness I found you!
Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!
There's no time for that.
There's a cockatrice on the loose!
A cockatrice!
It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake.
Now, come on!
Never look one in the eye!
If you look a cockatrice in the eye?
Girls!
Wait!
See?
Now we have to?
Girls, please.
Girls?
now listen to me, girls, I?
please!
Girls!
Behind me, now!
You!
Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man.
Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again.
Do you understand me?
Are you girls all right?
I was so worried!
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, you better, or I'll give you...
the Stare!
And that's when it brought you back from stone.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals.
Boy, was I wrong.
I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew.
Did you finish all those capes?
Won't you stay for some tea?
Allow me.
[clears throat]
Girls?
Go and get your things.
Rarity is here to see you home.
I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
Of course.
How about later today?
Oh my.
Oh, oh!
But they blocked up all the holes.
Oof!
All those scary monsters popping up everywhere.
Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
Is everything all right?
Photo Finish?
What a lovely compliment.
[squee]
That's wonderful.
Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.
Oh, goodness.
I don't know.
I'm flattered, really.
But...
There has to be somepony more quali-
Somepony more into fashion.
Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight.
Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it.
[sigh]
What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
A-a-attitude and, um...
pizzazz.
[whimper]
[squeal]
I'm so sorry.
I tried my best.
Oh, Rarity.
I was so worried I'd ruined everything.
Oh, I am so excited for you.
Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
I can't, Rarity.
Ah...
Aaah...
[tiny sneeze]
N...
nervous.
You can't let Rarity down.
You must do this.
You must.
You must.
You must.
Oh, yes.
Best time ever...
I'll see you at the spa?
Our usual time?
[yelp]
Photo Finish?
Um...
Photo Finish?
Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
It's just that I'm running late.
Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
Rarity!
I'm so sorry I'm...
Oh no.
She's already gone, isn't she?
Oh, I can't believe this.
I am so frustrated, I could just scream.
[inhales]
[squeak]
[sighs]
Can I tell you something?
You promise not to tell Rarity?
Pinkie Pie Swear?
I don't like being a model.
No, I hate being a model.
All this attention is awful, just awful.
And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must.
I must!
I must!
[sigh]
I must...
Oh, what were you about to say?
Oh, no.
I could never do such a thing.
Rarity would be devastated.
Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much.
Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore.
She'd find somepony else with...
the magic!
You really think it'll work?
Oof!
[gasp]
Ooh...
Aah!
[barks]
[brays]
[moans]
This is awful.
Just awful!
Somehow I've become more popular than ever.
Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!
If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
I'm great!
I'm a super famous fashion model.
Why wouldn't I be great?
You did?
Love?
Oh, Rarity.
I hate being a model.
More than anything.
I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to...
shine all over Equestria.
Never!
If we'd just told each other the truth.
Me too.
I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.
Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
I'd like to be a tree...
Huffy the magic dragon!
A stampede of buffalo.
And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
But why?
Pinkie!
We're so glad you're safe.
There you go, Mr Mousey.
Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you.
And it will be just like new in no time at all.
Oh, you're welcome.
Happy to be able to help.
You...
found a watch?
You...
wanna be a watch?
You're running!
Running out of time?
You're...
late?
[gasp]
I'm late for a very important date!
The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner.
Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party, and we all promised we'd be there.
But I'm not there!
Oh, do I look all right?
Do I need to bring anything?
Maybe I shouldn't go.
Aah!
It's starting!
I'm missing it!
Oh, thanks, Angel.
I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and...
Oh, right.
I'm late.
Oh, okay then.
See you later.
Phew.
Made it.
[gasp]
[gulp]
No one.
Never mind.
I'll go home.
Thanks, Twilight.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
Wow, Twilight.
I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.
But she's met us all before.
Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
Or...
perhaps not that casual.
It's okay, Twilight.
So our friends' manners aren't perfect.
I doubt the princess will even notice.
Oh yes, Your Highness.
Yes, I love to take care of animals.
Oh...
I...
I...
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, you poor little thing.
How did you ever get in such bad condition?
Don't you worry, Philomena.
I'll nurse you back to health.
As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly.
I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help.
Oh my.
We'd better get you to bed right away.
There.
[gasp]
This is far worse than I thought.
What you need is some medicine.
Stat!
Here you go, Philomena.
This will fix you right up.
Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
Always works.
[gasp]
Uh...
Almost always.
There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you.
Come on now.
You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate.
Mmm...
See?
It's delicious.
Good and good for you.
Here comes the choo-choo train.
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
Oh dear.
Don't worry, Philomena.
I know what'll make you feel better.
Wait right here.
I have just the thing.
Look, Philomena.
I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up.
Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time.
Didn't you, boy?
Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
Aw, look.
I think he likes you.
[vocalizes My Little Pony theme]
Your turn now, Philomena.
Go ahead.
You can do it.
[vocalizes My Little Pony theme]
Um...
good try?
I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat.
A humidifier.
[deep breath]
Refreshing.
How's that feeling now for you, Philomena?
Better?
Oh...
That's okay.
I know lots of other ways to take care of you.
Don't worry.
You're gonna get better.
How about...
Aromatherapy?
Warm bath?
Ointment?
Scalpel.
Surgical tape.
Feathers.
Oh, Philomena.
I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health.
I've tried everything I know.
And look at you.
You're worse than ever.
I couldn't leave the poor thing there.
She needed my help.
How could I just walk away and not do anything?
I had to do something.
But...
But...
[sigh]
You're right.
Okay, let's...
...go.
But it's daytime.
Going to return Philomena, remember?
Why not?
Do you?
You really think the princess would do that?
All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
Please, Twilight.
You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess.
And everything will be fine.
I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
She can't fly.
Uh...
well, she keeps pulling her feathers off.
The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.
I don't think she likes it.
Of course, but...
Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.
It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise.
Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
I made it for Philomena.
But she wouldn't eat it.
Philomena!
Come back!
Excuse me!
Sorry, but we've gotta find...
Philomena, come down from there!
You'll hurt yourself!
I'll catch you!
[gasp]
[cries and whimpers]
It's all my fault.
I'm the one who did it.
Some help I was.
But it's my fault!
Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but...
Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird.
I really was only trying to help the poor little thing.
Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest.
So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.
I don't understand!
What is that thing?
What happened to Philomena?
A...
A phoenix?
So...
aren't you gonna banish me?
Or throw me in a dungeon?
Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
I guess I have some imagination.
I know.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
It's beautiful.
Thank you, Philomena.
No hard feelings.
All right, little ones.
This way.
This way.
You really should be more careful.
Somepony could get hurt.
Why are you in such a hurry anyway?
Oh, that would be interesting.
You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
Oh yes.
It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy.
And a very weak flyer.
It was the most humiliating moment of my life.
And then, out of nowhere...
I had never seen such beautiful creatures.
Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home.
And I'd never been near the ground before.
Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened.
Bye, girls!
Wait a second.
I heard that explosion.
And I saw the rainbow too.
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
Do you realize what this means?
All of us had a special connection before we even met.
I'm so glad we're friends!
Hey.
How about a song?
He's just wonderful.
Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.
[yelp]
It's been lovely.
As in...
It's...
uh...
a big house.
He's...
a bear.
It's, uh, really more of a cave.
And, uh, he wants us to look after his house...
uh, cave...
while he's, uh...
Not since this morning.
I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.
As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will.
[gasp]
[scream]
I really thought she'd be more excited.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, definitely.
Yes.
Will they be safe, Twilight?
Opalescence, no!
To meet!
Oh my!
A meadowlark!
I think she's calling to me.
It's exactly what I wished for!
[gasp]
My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
Was that you?
Yes...
Well...
Excuse me.
I see a toco toucan!
And a spider monkey!
And, oh!
Is that a wallaroo?
Oh, Fluttershy.
You're such a loudmouth.
This isn't what I wished for.
...for this moment!
I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.
I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends!
But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
Gotcha!
It's okay.
I promise not to hurt you.
I just wanna be your...
friend?
COME OUT!
I'll catch you yet, my pretties.
Oh yes.
As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net...
you'll be mine!
Mine!
[evil laugh]
Whoa!
You're...
going to love me!
Talking!
Now, Angel, you really shouldn't?
It's not possible!
I must be seeing things!
Oh dear.
I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds.
I'd hate to have to share them.
[squeal]
Can we go home now?
W-We have to go in there?
[scream]
What's that?
Who's there?
Girls!
[teeth chatter]
Okay, I can do this.
I can...
[scream]
Oh, wait a minute...
Butterflies?
Wait!
Don't leave me here!
Oh, no.
I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
Not at all.
I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
Not really.
In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.
Aw, boo-hoo-hoo!
Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?
Oh, that's right, you can't.
You don't have one.
Oh, yeah?
Well ha, ha.
Ha, ha.
Ha ha-ha ha ha.
Ha, ha.
I'm touching your gem, Rarity.
Ha, ha.
Good boy, Angel.
Mama's so proud.
Don't worry, you won't.
[laughter]
With pleasure.
'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?
Your face!
[bang]
Hah!
Keep away!
Hmph!
Garbage.
Oops, sorry, Rainbow Crash.
[chuckle]
Yeah!
I'm sick of you losers.
Oh no!
Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!
She's not here.
Got it!
Um...
'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
I can't!
That big... dumb... MEANIE!
[assorted grunts]
[continued assorted grunts]
You really should have come to me sooner.
You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought something really awful had happened.
Wow.
I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
Why would you enchant your doll?
Magic kindergarten?
Please, your Highness.
We all saw that Twilight was upset.
Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
Go away!
No candy here!
Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
It is you.
Ah, and Nightmare Moon.
[gasp]
Nightmare Moon?
[yelps]
Likewise.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Perfect, lesson over!
[nervous, dazed laughter]
Yes.
I thought you knew.
You didn't know?
She didn't know?
Oh, please don't be mad at us.
Ohh!
Y, y, Oh, really?
You really want a pet?
Really?
'Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house!
Oh, and I know you'll just love them!
And they'll love you!
Oh, and you'll be best friends forever and ever!
Awesome, cool, got it!
Come on, the sky's the limit!
Really?
Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it.
Yes, he does.
Aww, look, he likes you!
Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!
Bigger, cooler.
Right.
Not just any squirrel.
A flying squirrel!
I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me.
Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and?
Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet.
He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way.
You won't even know he's here.
Oh, just let him try.
It won't hurt to let him try.
Just let him try?
Tortoise.
Where's Rainbow Dash?
It's the turtle!
Oh, whatever...
Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.
Rainbow!
Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
The best of the best like you wanted, remember?
It can fly and it's not a squirrel!
Should we sing about it again?
Yay?
But Rainbow!
You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
She really cares about everypony's safety.
Ooh, ooh!
And I did the flyby afterwards.
Oh, poor Opal.
Where is the sick darling?
Poor baby.
She looks awful.
Happy birthday, Spike.
[screams]
I'm up here!
I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!
Spike?
But why would Spike steal my chicken coop?
He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!
I-If you wouldn't mind, that is...
We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
[gasps]
We did it!
I can't believe we did it!
I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting!
Woo-hoo!
Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much...
I can't go onstage!
I don't want everypony looking at me!
So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
A lot?
Hundreds?
[yelps]
Commander Hurricane, sir!
How did it go, sir?
[yelps]
Conquer, sir?
I don't see any enemies, Commander.
Just...
snow.
[yelps]
What a view...
I can see my future house from here.
I vote for calm.
W-W-What is that...
thing?
Well, I don't hate you...
I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys.
Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.
What was that?
Oh, I would love to babysit!
But I can't today, sorry.
I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic.
You understand, don't you?
Y-you're not mad at me, are you?
Please don't be mad at me!
Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!
I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be...
very startling.
[gasps]
Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.
Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!
I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
We're so glad you're safe!
Are you okay?
Um, excuse me?
Ooh...
Can you please slow down?
Help!
STOP!
Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof.
But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.
[yawns]
Who could that be?
It's still dark!
[squee]
[shrieks]
Oh, where are we?
What's the rush?
Um, well, uh?
I guess I?
Gee, Rainbow Dash.
It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
Oh, gosh, Pinkie.
I love your new style.
For the record, I don't mind?
Uh, Pinkie Pie?
Got it.
Oh, I'm so worried!
It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.
We thought we'd come and cheer you up!
We know how much you like to win!
Um...
sky five?
But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.
Glad we could...
cheer you up?
Lunch time!
Who's hungry?
Plenty for everypony.
Slow down, sweetie.
[giggles]
Here you go, Angel bunny.
Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win.
Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum-yum-yum!
What?
But...
Well then, what will you eat?
I'm not sure I can even make that.
Well...
I don't want you to starve...
Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of?
[sighs]
I'll make your special recipe.
Hmm, let's see.
Asparagus.
Excuse me, um, I think you just stepped in front of me?
Excuse me, I think you made a mistake?
You see I was actually here first and?
I know.
Oh, pardon me, sir?
I think you just cut in front of me.
I said [into ear trumpet]
I think you just cut in front of me.
I noticed.
Hey!
But?
Oh, okay.
There's no rush.
Oh, it's-it's really no big deal...
What problem?
Oh, go right ahead, Pinkie Pie.
You first.
A doormat?
Oh, okay.
I promise.
Good!
Oh, that's okay, I don't mind.
Um...
I guess not.
Let's see...
I also need tomatoes.
Here you go.
Oh, but last week, it was only one bit.
Oh, okay.
I don't wanna argue about it.
I guess you're right!
Um...
okay.
I need that cherry.
Boy, am I glad you have one cherry left.
You see, I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel.
He's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.
Here you go.
Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!
Ten?
Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong, and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?
Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous!
I insist on paying you...
eleven bits!
Umm...
mean, nine bits!
Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!
It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.
But...
I was only doing what you did.
But...
I can't let Angel starve!
He won't eat it unless I make it just right!
I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
Twenty?
Oh, but, I don't have that much!
Ta-da!
Here you go, Angel.
Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted.
Angel?
[sighs]
Look at me...
I really am a doormat.
The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos.
Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre.
As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!
Uh...
excuse me!
[squeaks]
Who, me?
[gulps]
Uh, well...
Okay.
Um, politely walk around him?
Gingerly tip-toe around him?
Go back home and try again tomorrow?
Sorry.
Uh...
next time, get out of the way before...
I bump into you, 'cause...
I totally won't be sorry when I do!
Okay, I feel good.
I feel ready to attack the day, as Iron Will says.
Excuse me, Mr Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias...
...again.
Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over.
Thank you.
[excited giggle]
I can't believe it worked!
[clears throat]
Excuse me?
Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?
A-hemmmm, can you move?
You're blocking my path.
When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!
Good!
What do you think you're doing?
Didn't you see me?
'Maybe'?
Maybes are for babies!
Now go to the back of the line where you belong!
Iron Will's not a monster.
He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration.
His techniques really work.
Yes I am.
And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.
You laugh at me, I wrath at you!
Bye, girls.
What a day.
Taxi!
Oh no you don't.
Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!
Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!
[screams]
Nopony!
You got this, new Fluttershy!
This day is yours!
And nopony's gonna take it away from you!
Am I right?
Right!
What?
He's delivered the wrong mail, again!
And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
You apologize, I penalize!
[bites]
Sure, you just?
[gasps]
[growls]
You make me lose, I blow my fuse!
Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy?
And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!
What?
You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy!
But old Fluttershy is gone!
No, you want wimp Fluttershy.
You want pushover Fluttershy.
You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!
Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?
Why not?
I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity.
With your 'petty' concerns about fashion.
Oh, and what are you passionate about?
Birthday cake?
Party hats?
I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!
[growls]
[whimper]
I'm the monster.
Go away!
Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!
Pinkie's right.
I'm the only one to blame.
But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again.
Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.
I-I'm not sure I can.
I'm too far gone.
Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster.
[sneezes]
Um, no.
As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing.
Well, I'm not satisfied.
Well, I guess I'm the first then.
But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay.
It's as simple as that.
I'm sorry, but no means no.
Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good.
I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far.
Friends?
Dear Princess Celestia,
[grunts]
Happy to...
help...
but...
can I carry...
the balloons next time?
Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all.
Right, Cerberus?
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
There's nothing fun about dragons!
Scary, yes!
Fun, no!
Now that you put it that way, yes!
Miss out on what?
Dragons?
Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?
Thanks, but...
no thanks!
I...
said...
[whimpers]
Achoo.
Hi, Rainbow Dash.
[coughs weakly]
Oh, I [sniffs] I think I have [coughs weakly] the pony pox.
I'm sorry.
I really, really wanted to come to training day today [coughs weakly], but this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop.
Achoo.
[coughs weakly]
I know, plenty of bed?
[yelps]
Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better.
[laughs nervously]
I'll just get out of these robes and?
Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt.
I guess I can't fly after all?
[yelps]
Well, y'see, uh, well...
Oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
I can't fly!
But that was different, that was an emergency!
This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others.
Don't you remember flight camp?
I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!
You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad.
It was horrible!
The other foals used to tease me, a lot!
I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...
Wait.
I'll do it.
I will.
I'm game.
[takes deep breath]
Yes!
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs]
don't have the courage right now...
[squeaks]
[sniffles]
Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
Yes, yes, I do remember.
The river was swelling...
...and you were scared...
...yes, I did tell you to never give up...
and to believe in yourself.
You're right, my friends.
I shouldn't give up.
I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer!
A great flyer!
That has to be some kind of mistake!
I worked so hard!
No, I didn't.
I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me!
There's no way I'll fly with 10.
wing power tomorrow!
How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.
wing power and you were flying with 2.
Exactly!
Humiliated!
[between sobs]
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
Twilight!
I figured...
if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado...
the least I could do was offer moral support!
Oh no!
That's terrible news!
Oh, I'm too nervous to look!
I won't make a difference!
My measly 2.
wing power is still too little!
[gulps]
[yelps]
Whuh, what?
Did we do it?
Dear Princess Celestia,
[gasp]
Oh my.
So did I.
So tasty.
And it was so good.
But I'm really really sorry.
Oh my goodness!
What an honor!
Um, Twilight?
Are you okay?
She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
But he was singing really off-key.
Can you believe it?
We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
Oh, goodness!
Are you okay?
[gulp]
What kind of things?
[gasp]
Th-That's one of the things, isn't it?
Oh, um.
Excuse me!
Hello!
Umm, I was just wondering.
[deep breath]
Oh, oh, that's okay, um, you all look really busy.
[laughs nervously]
Huh?
[scared, nervous noises]
[shrieks]
[screams]
[nervous exhale]
[catching breath]
Isn't there...
somepony else who could...
take over the jousting demonstration with you?
[cries]
[sipping tea]
Not especially.
Feeling better, Pinkie?
What are friends for?
I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help.
Oh, Pinkie Pie, I'm so glad you wandered by.
I know I promised not to have any fun today, but, oh, I couldn't help myself.
All of my critter friends wanted a picnic, and I couldn't disappoint them.
Come join us.
We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around, don't we, critters?
Who's Applejohn?
Walls?
But we're outside.
Goodness.
Was it something I said?
Huh?
And they trashed our critter picnic!
Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?
That looks like fun.
Don't be scared, little friends.
Twilight is wonderful with magic.
Anything happens to them, Twilight, so help me...
Of course she's good with magic.
Twilight's great with magic.
I guess I just don't want my little friends to be scared.
Oh, oh, look how scared they are!
I know!
Stop, stop!
They can't take it!
Um, I think I may have found something?
Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magic?
Um, there's a picture here of that necklace?
It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold?
If you read a little further, you'll see?
Yes, but, um, you can't?
Maybe we could?
But, h-how?
Maybe we should?
it must be?
Whaaat?
I'll crack under the pressure!
I'll snap like a twig!
But?
but I, I?
[sighs]
Okay.
Oh, oh dear!
Rarity's dangerous mission outfit is ruined!
Guess we'd better go back!
[laughs nervously]
Oh, okay, okay, you're right.
I need to be brave and find Twilight.
you found her?
She's in the Everfree Forest?
Oh, this is me being brave!
I wanna be brave at home, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear!
[sips]
The more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her!
I just wish we could help her.
Me too.
Oh, goodness.
If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do.
If she needed help, I think she'd realize it.
I don't think that's her favorite s?
That was very convincing!
Good news.
Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.
But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him a nuisance.
[gasps]
Beaverton Beaverteeth!
Such language!
Glad I could help.
And...
you really think I'll know best how to do that?
You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?
You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you...
the Stare!
Oh, dear.
He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we have to act the same way.
We should at least try to be hospitable.
You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you, Angel Bunny?
Oh, I'm sorry about Angel.
Are you alright?
I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me.
And...
I think I actually know what to do.
I think the key is to befriend him.
Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that.
I think it's worth a try.
Discord?
Oh, there you are.
Listen, Discord, I just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do to?
uh, umm, are you eating...
paper?
Well, um...
I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone.
Nngh...
I did say that, so...
if this makes you more comfortable...
by all means, please feel free.
[gasps]
My friends aren't nasty!
Goodness!
I hear Twilight!
We're fine.
Everything's going great.
Isn't it, Angel?
Oh, but you're wrong!
We're making great progress!
I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself.
That does explain the paper eating...
But we aren't gonna need a spell.
He's already really considering being reformed!
He said so.
If I'm going to be his friend, I have to start by giving him the benefit of the doubt!
Tell you what.
Bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his manners will have really improved by then.
I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first.
See what a beautiful job he did helping?
Discord set the entire table himself.
I'm so proud.
As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil.
Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?
Oh, come on now, Dashie.
You're not even giving this a chance.
Discord?
Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
You know what I see?
I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!
Because that's what friends do.
Why, of course!
I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along.
Well, now you do!
Now is not a good time, Angel.
We're having a dinner party.
[gasps]
Such language!
[sighs]
It's no use.
They won't listen to a word I say!
Oh, of course I do!
Do you all think I'm a silly, gullible fool?
I've just been trying to gain his friendship any way I can, so he'd come to trust and listen to me!
Time to see if it worked.
As you can see, there's a big mess down here at Sweet Apple Acres.
It is awful.
This is Applejack's home, and it's being destroyed by innocent creatures who would never be acting this way if it weren't for your reckless behavior.
You need to fix this.
Yes?
I will never use my Element of Harmony against you.
Discord!
That's not fixing it!
Why, I oughta...
Don't call me your pal!
I made a promise not to use my element against him, and I'm going to keep it.
[growls]
Not.
Your.
Friend!
Go on.
Say it...
See?
He can be a real sweetheart once you get to know him.
Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Oh...
sorry, it's a bad time.
It's just that...
Princess Cadance needs us to do a great job welcoming the Head of the Equestria Games when she visits the Crystal Empire tomorrow?
Oh, I don't know what was I thinking.
Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and...
here I am coming to ask you for a favor.
You were probably going to say no anyway.
All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel.
[yelps]
All I have is this jewel.
Does this mean you'll do it?
Oh, thank you, thank you!
So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good.
Oh, well, yes.
But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Angel, aren't you just so excited?
See you tomorrow.
So sorry I'm late.
Silly bunny had hidden his brush.
Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it.
Oh, I promise it'll be okay.
I'll fluff your tail twice next week.
Three times?
Oh my goodness.
Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect!
You did such a good job fluffing his tail.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, no...
We're gonna blow it...
Oh, no!
Can we help you with your bags?
Ooh, I love flower print!
Sorry.
Oh, my gosh, she's so nice!
cha!
Where's she going in such a hurry?
Each of us search a sector.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh...
Hey, Twilight...
I'm moving back to Cloudsdale.
I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh.
But...
I don't really know anything about animals...
I...
know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her.
Hurry, Twilight!
Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?
Um...
Hello?
Little...
woodland creatures?
I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe...
rest for a bit?
Uh...
look!
Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on.
And some crunchy, munchy acorns too.
Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?
Aww, look at that.
I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry.
Oh, you are very welcome, little friends.
Goodness, it's like I can understand them!
I...
I feel strange, like...
like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am!
My destiny!
Wha...
what happened?
[gasps]
What happened?
Wow...
You look just like a princess!
We love you, Twilight.
We'd better get going.
We don't want to miss our train.
You should take that as a yes.
Excuse me...
Oh, pardon me...
Are you all right?
My goodness, what is it that has caused you all such distress?
Whatever it is, I'm sure it's nothing you need to really worry about.
[screams]
Oh, no, you were right.
You should be worried!
Very, very worried!
We have to figure out something!
I don't know how much more of this Ponyville can take!
[yelps]
I don't know how much more I can take!
Oh, I hope you know we wouldn't normally go through your books without permission...
Um, maybe?
Hey!
We can't do that!
What if he really is telling the truth?
Um, it's Fluttershy.
We were really worried about you.
It is probably for the best.
[gasp]
I think it's dying!
I know who would know what to do.
But we sent her home.
... But we need our friend.
But our friendship remains.
And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up.
Um, Rarity?
Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest?
It is...
star-spider season, after all.
Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason.
Oh, well then I'm happy to help.
What is it?
I see...
That does sound...
very important.
Um, are you sure you need those tapestries?
[gasp]
Angel!
Angel!
Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that.
Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you!
You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone...
You have to be careful!
Well, it certainly could use some restoration.
[grunts]
Ow...
I think I hurt my wing.
Oh, of course.
What do you mean?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Really?
Oh dear.
Angel?
Rarity, have you seen him?
Oh, goodness!
We have to find him.
An ancient castle is no place for a bunny.
He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him!
He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!
Rarity!
What is it?
[gasp]
Angel!
But we can't leave now, not with Angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle!
He could be trapped under a crumbling statue, or stuck high in a tower without food or water or any friends at all!
Angel!
Angel!
Angel?
Did you find Angel?
Is he okay?
They're lovely, Rarity, but...
I have to keep looking for Angel.
Oh, I hope he doesn't think I've given up on him.
[screams]
Rarity!
I know hiding isn't really your sense of humor, but please let this be a joke!
Angel!
Rarity!
Oh...
I hope you two are together.
[gasp]
Angel?
AAANGEEEEEL!
It's okay, Angel!
You're okay!
You're okay!
Aaangeeeeel!
Must... save... Ange?
...Oh.
Now don't go running off again!
Oh, I can't believe I was so frightened.
Guess I let my imagination get the best of me.
All of us?
Oh, my.
I, uh, I could be excited.
I don't really know.
I wasn't really think?
Oh, well, I guess maybe I'm a little kinda sort of excited.
Yeah...
So, um, why am I excited?
Oh, I'm not so sure she's gonna last another four months...
Yeah.
I can vouch for that...
Uh...
should we go in and help her, maybe?
Um, she was just trying to help, Miss.
Oh, gosh!
That wouldn't...
be very...
polite!
Oh, I don't think she's home.
Maybe we should just come back later.
Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!
Ahem.
I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?
I'm trying!
You seem to have everything under control.
I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad.
Oh, goodness!
Are you okay?
Are you kidding me?
I mean, I know you're evil and everything, but you hurt a teensy, little, harmless firefly?
Really?
Well you're just a great, big, meanie!
There!
I said it!
What makes you think you're so special?
Like the rules of common courtesy don't apply to you?
[voice getting even deeper]
Why don't you pick on somepony your own size?
[roars]
[roars]
[spits]
Oh, I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone.
Um, excuse me, Mr Vampire Bat--
We were just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind leaving that really big apple alone?
[gasps]
Um...
yes.
But...
it could've been a no.
This is the first vampire fruit bat I've ever met and, well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language.
Monsters?
Oh, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?
Um, excuse me, but, um, what if instead of rounding them up, we...
let them have part of the orchard?
They're only here because they're hungry!
If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy!
After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard!
The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees!
[gasps]
Oh no.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
Yes, but it's not something I take lightly.
I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances.
I'm sorry.
I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats [inhales]
vampire fruit bats!
It just feels wrong!
Um...
Um...
Okay, I'll do it.
They're not icky.
Oh, um, are you sure I really need-- Okay.
I really, really, really hate to do this to you...
I just hope you can forgive me...
[sniffs]
I'm sorry.
I don't.
Maybe we should just call this off.
Not sure about the rest of you guys, but I'm really hungry...
I have a bad feeling about this.
A really bad feeling about this...
That apple...
It looks... so juicy... and sweet...
[slurps]
[hisses]
[slurps]
[hisses]
[hisses]
[slurps]
[hisses]
[hisses]
[slurps]
[hisses]
[sniffs]
[hisses]
[hisses]
Oh...
where am I?
But...
what happened to me?
[gasps]
I tried to eat ponies?
So I wasn't a vampire?
Yes I was, or yes I wasn't?
But I didn't try and eat ponies?
I did?
I'm confused...
And don't forget, now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees.
And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right.
Sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends 'no'.
Not that you'll need it.
We're sure you'll win.
Like get us in to see Hinny of the Hills!
Sounds amazing.
Oh, no!
We've gotta help her find a cab, now!
And after that...
Um, here in Manehattan?
We're all ears.
Right, Bulk Biceps?
I remember.
I really, really, really want to qualify for you and Ponyville.
[yelps]
Oh, thanks, Pinkie Pie.
That was a scary- I mean, great cheer.
[laughs nervously]
[yelps]
I am so proud to be representing Ponyville.
Oh, it's such an honor to even try out for the Games.
I just hope I don't let anypony down.
Right.
Are you really, really, really sure you're ready?
I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure.
Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm just so proud of you.
You scooped Soarin out of the sky and brought him down to the ground and now, now he's okay.
At least, I hope he's okay.
Are you okay?
Um, 'Rainbow Dash' actually starts with an 'R'.
Um...
I'm ready to take the horseshoe, if you want me to.
[yelps]
Oof!
[giggles]
What's happened?
Do you think you'll be better by tryouts?
Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash.
We'll take care of you...
or, at least, somepony will.
Like, a medic or-or a doctor, or a nurse.
And how is our patient doing?
We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt, but you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts.
We'll be alright.
We even have a replacement.
We're so, so sorry that you can't compete.
We all know how much you love to fly.
And we promise-
...That if we qualify and make it to the Equestria Games and all win gold medals, you can have ours, because we know how much a gold medal means to you.
Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us.
I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will.
Um, so sorry for barging in like this...
but I'm so excited, I just couldn't wait to tell somepony!
The Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures have given me permission to observe the rarest, tiniest, most adorable magical creatures in all of Equestria ?
the Breezies!
Oh, it's not just fantastic; it just might be the best news ever!
Oh, I will.
And I hope you have fun with Cadance.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, everypony!
Now, now, he's learned his lesson.
Isn't that right, my little patient?
Go, Pinkie, go!
Oh, I like a nice picnic party.
You're really a certified party pony?
Oh, no!
Not a goof off!
I have no idea, hehe.
Oh, I think it's going to be magical.
I'd be honored.
Um, isn't it a little late to be changing the theme?
It is a little funny.
Oh, good morning, little friends.
Your singing is oh-so pretty.
Yes, it is a very beautiful day today.
Certainly something worth singing about.
Oh, thank you so much.
[giggles]
You're too kind.
Oh...
You...
um...
you didn't hear me...
um...
[gasp, whimper]
Um, well, I?
Well, you see, I?
I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do not want to perform with them.
Well, you see...
I...
I have...
um...
I...
I have...
I have...
stage fright.
I'm very thankful the Pony Tones are singing at the Pet Center fundraiser, and I'm really looking forward to the performance, but I'll be watching safely from the audience.
Thank you.
Angel's right.
We'd better get going.
There's a lot of work to do before tomorrow's event.
[sighs]
Oh, I thought you were all amazing, Pony Tones!
Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones are really gonna make the Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser so special.
Thank you so much for helping me help the animals.
Mm-hmm.
[giggles]
Good morning, Pony Tones!
[gasps]
Wait, what?
You have to perform!
Otherwise, the fundraiser will be a disaster!
Why not?
[gasps]
Of course!
A remedy!
Follow me!
Oh, no!
Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's?
I don't want to talk about it.
[gasps]
Flutterguy!
Yes!
I'll do it!
I'd do anything for the animals!
Except that.
I just can't bring myself to sing on stage in front of everypony.
Huh?
Even still, I just don't think I could sing in front of...
Oh...
Okay then...
[gulps]
Mix it up!
[inhales]
[inhales]
Oh, Rarity, we can't disappoint that sweet little filly.
But we wouldn't want to disappoint the Mayor.
We wouldn't want to disappoint the spa patrons.
We wouldn't want to disappoint the schoolponies.
It's just...
I didn't know that last performance was my last performance.
Yes...
I'm here.
It was.
Well, thank you all.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Because I'm never going to sing in front of anypony ever again.
You mean, you knew I really wanted to perform?
Oh...
Yes!
Surprisingly...
okay!
Oh, no...
I couldn't do that!
I'll get there someday.
But for now...
baby steps, everypony.
Baby steps.
Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love, but hiding behind these fears means you're only hiding from your true self.
It's much better to face those fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be.
Okay, everypony.
As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville.
And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land.
Did I mention how tiny they are?
So tiny!
I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!
But these cheers should be quiet cheers.
We don't want to startle them.
They need to be able to concentrate.
Why don't we try it?
You can do it, Breezies.
Oh, my.
Oh, it's okay.
Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony.
Let's try it again.
Perhaps just a little bit quieter.
Just a little quieter.
Perfect!
Oh, um, I mean... yay.
Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed.
That's right!
And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes.
That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.
Now you understand.
Oh, thank you.
I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria.
Um, Rarity?
I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but...
Oh, no-no-no-no-no.
It's the perfect amount of purple.
It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket.
You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!
[gasps]
He's right!
You must all gather as close as you possibly can!
Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures!
And you speak my language too?
Oh, it's not your fault.
Oh, Spike, it's okay!
It could have happened to any one of us.
Maybe we should wait just a moment or so.
They've been through so much...
Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket.
Oh, no problem.
Oh, did you need some more water?
Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?
Oh, of course!
But watch your step!
Has it been an hour already?
Oh, my goodness!
Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world.
Oh, yes, that's right!
On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready.
I'd...
rather not say.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch very soon.
Um, now, Seabreeze-
But that is just not true, Seabreeze.
It was because of a leaf, and you know that!
Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?
Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood.
You're excused.
Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze!
I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special.
But you have to go.
Nopony here will deny that-
Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless.
I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible!
I had no idea you all have colds!
Really?
All of you?
Oh, dear.
I can't let you go out there sick!
What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now?
Oh, yes.
I mean, not quite.
Um, maybe just a few more minutes?
Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point.
I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home.
Ooh...
You're all awfully anxious...
Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be...
Oh, yes, that does make sense...
Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze?
Seabreeze?
Has anypony seen Seabreeze?
[gasps]
Where's he going?
There's no way he can handle being out there on his own!
Excuse me, bees?
Can you please back off my Breezie friend?
He didn't mean any harm.
It was just an accident.
I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me?
Does this bring to mind any images for you?
Perhaps a bee?
Excuse me!
I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is not working!
You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie!
I demand that you go away now, or you'll have to answer to me!
Of course.
You could've gotten seriously hurt out there.
Ponyville is much too dangerous for you.
One tiny acorn is a threat!
Oh, my goodness.
I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything...
[gasps]
Time is running out, and you may never make it home!
Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean.
The message doesn't get across.
Yes, but they had to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way.
We need to go, now!
My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late!
You would never survive in Ponyville.
I can't help you any more.
In fact, I wasn't helping you at all by being nice.
Oh...
But the truth of the matter is that I must be firm!
You must go, now!
[sniffs]
Oh, my.
Maybe it's because there are too few of them.
When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together.
[gasps]
Maifo flai batendud!
Um, I mean, let's go!
I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family!
Goodbye, Breezies.
I must go now.
Thank you!
I'll miss you.
I'll miss all of you!
My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do.
Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.
Ooh...
[groans]
Oh, what kind of a rock are they?
I sure hope Maud has an appetite.
We're ever so glad to meet you.
Oh, you have a pocket pet?
Like a tiny mouse?
Or a baby bird?
Or a trained butterfly?
I truly wish I'd spent more time with Boulder, because I'm having a very hard time remembering what he looks like.
I don't mean to interrupt, but we really should get these little critters home.
It's getting awfully late, and they've had a very busy day.
On the bright side, Boulder seemed really sweet.
Hello there, Hummingway.
I'm ever so happy to see you.
He says hello, and he's happy to see us too.
These spiders only live in Ponyville, and even though they may look a teeny bit scary, they're actually very sweet and help keep other, more dangerous insects away!
Oh gosh.
I'm not sure we're even friends yet.
You're ever so thoughtful to share your special bonding ritual with us, but, uh...
Maybe we should have just pretended we were friends with Maud.
Oh, goodness!
Thank goodness Maud was able to reach her in time.
Pinkie Pie was in trouble!
Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.
All of this is one headpiece?
Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now.
Make me a dress, Rarity, please?
Girls.
Girls!
Girls!
Stop!
Now, is that any way to talk to a friend?
Don't you have more important things to do?
Like prepare Rainbow for her big test?
Well, no offense to your teaching methods, Twilight, but I think I may have a way to help Rainbow.
Celestia and Luna, back when they were happy.
Gummy's an Earth pony, Winona's a unicorn, and Tank is a Pegasus.
Oh, no!
And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight, from the seventh squadron.
What about our play?
Yes, but how?
I, Princess Celestia, banish you, Princess Luna, to the moon.
Let us celebrate our first Celestial year of peace!
The history of the Wonderbolts!
Oh, my goodness!
Oh no!
I'd really hate to see you disappointed.
I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first...
But, but how is Rainbow Dash going to get the book she really wants?
Aww, an Orthros!
How cute!
Yes, such a good two-headed boy.
Yes, you are!
They really do have everything at the Traders Exchange.
Do you really think so?
I just hope it looks okay.
Um, well, okay!
Um, I can do that, I think.
Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those?
You know...
unless you really want to...
There he is!
Pretty pretty please?
Oh, he's just an affectionate little two-headed fellow.
Aren't you, little boy?
[blows bear call]
My bear call!
Of course.
It's just a bear call.
There's nothing I could have traded it for that's more valuable to me than you.
And the chicken for a lamp...
But...
what do we do now?
Oh goodness, oh goodness!
Good boy!
There, there, that's a good Orthros.
You just have to know how to train them.
With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet.
Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time.
I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for...
I don't even know how many moons!
But...
if that is what you really want...
[blows bird whistle]
La la-la la-la la-la la la...
There you go, Mr Robin!
Don't you look so content in your little house?
[gasps]
Oh, my goodness!
You're lost?
No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a...
bedroom.
Try that one over there.
No, no, that leads to a...
Shoe closet?
Oh, dear.
Maybe try the staircase?
Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase.
Yay.
What's wrong, Twilight?
Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.
I don't think it's that big of a surprise.
He can be very helpful.
But Twilight was right.
Even without the Elements, our friendship is as strong as ever.
I wouldn't miss it.
But he could be right, couldn't he?
What if there is something important in that chest?
Oh, the looks on their poor little faces!
But I knew that, as difficult as it was, pushing them away was the kindest thing I could do.
Oh, but I'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, you have too, Twilight.
What's wrong, Twilight?
Oh, my goodness, are you all right?
I'm sure Discord will catch Tirek and this will all be over soon.
[gasps]
You're back!
Did you bring the cucumber sandwiches?
Why are you doing this?
I thought we were friends!
I didn't.
I really didn't.
We aren't worth it!
I know.
I don't think you're quite there yet.
I agree with Twilight.
And Rarity.
And Applejack.
And Rainbow Dash.
And Pinkie Pie.
Oh, and probably Spike.
But if this is Ponyville, why are our cutie marks over there?
Um, maybe I'll just stay here with Spike.
O-o-on second thought, m-m-maybe I'd better go with them.
In case they need me.
I think it's lovely.
This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
[giggles]
I wish everypony in Equestria was as friendly as these ponies are.
Rainbow Dash, don't be so rude.
I don't think we should judge them.
They all seem perfectly happy with their choice.
Really, girls!
They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, but that's no reason to be rude.
We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends.
Really, Applejack, you're almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!
Oh, are you sure, Twilight?
Maybe they miss them a little, but even they didn't seem all that unhappy.
Why are our cutie marks over there?
This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
There, there, Rarity...
It's not so bad...
Well, I think they're nice.
Oh, thank goodness!
Can you help us, little birdie?
Go on, now!
Fly away and get us help!
Oh, even tweets don't make sense any more!
But that's because everypony's so nice and their village is so pretty, and, and...
Oh, you're right.
They probably would believe me.
I hate to lie to them.
They've been so welcoming and friendly...
aside from locking us in here and trying to brainwash us into abandoning the things that make us special...
Okay.
I'll do it.
But what do I do once I'm out?
I'd like to join!
If giving up my cutie mark means I get to stay in this lovely village with these lovely ponies, then I'll do it.
[gulps]
Um, I don't know who they were.
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't know your names and faces yet.
Gosh, you really are the nicest ponies I've ever met.
Brrrrrr!
[sighs]
Get the cutie marks back.
That's all you've gotta do, Fluttershy.
Just sneak through the dark up to that spooky old cave with the scary magical staff and get the cutie marks back.
Okay, you're doing great.
The cave's gotta be close now...
Oh, dear.
How am I ever going to get the cutie marks back now?
[gasps]
Oh, no...
Wait!
I'd like to lock them in.
Um, Starlight?
I think we might have one more friend joining us today.
Then how do you explain this?
Our cutie marks aren't in the vault!
They're in there with her!
They're gone!
They were right over there!
And I know they can do it!
And you got your countryisms back, too!
Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else?
Phew!
Thanks for helping me get them so fresh and clean, Twilight.
You probably can't wait to get back to your castle and take your own bath, huh?
I think you and I are the only ones left, and I can't wait to get the mud out of my mane.
Thank you ever so much for staying to give Angel a bath too, but, um...
I think he's dry.
Goodness!
It's gotten late!
You really didn't have to stay all day.
Not that we don't appreciate it.
Isn't that right?
I for one am exhausted.
[yawns]
Plus, I really need to rest up for that big pancake breakfast tomorrow.
And I'm sure you have to get the castle ready.
Um, Angel?
Leave?
Um, I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but has anypony else noticed that Twilight has been a little too helpful lately?
Leave?
Frazzled?
Are these your trophies?
Thank goodness somepony said something!
Oh, no!
Please don't do that!
If you all just take a deep breath and calm down?
I guess they must not like being scared out of their wits by exploding confetti cannons or something.
What do we do now?
Then Twilight will be stuck living in a castle that makes her feel...
sad!
Maybe we're all a little guilty of making ourselves feel at home instead of Twilight.
Oh, everything!
The books, the smell of books, the joy she felt from organizing books...
The ornaments on the chandelier are reminders of all the fun we've had together.
The time we shared donuts after the Grand Galloping Gala!
And some stuffed animals in your bedroom.
I suppose his heartbeat could be a teensy-weensy-eensy bit slower than usual...
I don't think he needs that.
Oh, that's not it either.
Nothing!
He's perfectly fine.
He's just going to hibernate.
[giggles]
When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy.
It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring.
And see?
Even tortoises do it!
When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground.
But don't worry.
He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up.
It's not a joke.
Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate.
It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us.
Where are you going?
How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash?
Let me handle this.
Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less.
Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.
She's got to be about done by now.
Can't be too much left in there.
Feeling better?
Oh, you poor, poor thing...
Happy winter.
[laughs]
Oh, Discord, I've never known anypony as funny as you!
I love that story about the time you tried to train your right paw... to fetch your left leg!
[giggles]
Oh, I do love our Tuesday teas, and I can't wait for you to meet my friend Tree Hugger.
She's going to love you too.
I met her on a trip to see the Breezies.
She's a member of the Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.
We're all gonna have so much fun together at the Grand Galloping Gala!
Oh, no.
Um, I'm afraid I've already asked Tree Hugger.
I'm sorry, Discord.
I assumed you'd have your own ticket since you and Princess Celestia are friends now.
Were you not invited?
But we haven't had any of our Tuesday teacakes.
Oh, my, you are funny!
Oh, how rude of me.
Tree Hugger, this is Discord.
Discord, Tree Hugger.
It's a compliment.
[giggles]
Really?
[giggles]
Wow.
How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall?
Discord!
I thought you weren't coming!
Am I really your oldest, bestest friend?
[giggles]
I can't believe I've never heard you speak of the Smooze before.
Sounds like you two are so close.
That's wonderful!
The four of us should go out to dinner sometime!
Oh, okay.
Treezie and I would love to talk to you more later!
Um, we went to the store and bought two cakes.
Oh, Tree Hugger, I've never known anypony as funny as you!
That was the most magical thing I've ever seen done with animals!
Discord, stop!
I don't understand why you're doing this!
We were all getting along so well!
Did you really think I'd abandon you just because I have a new friend?
No, Discord!
I invited a friend to a party!
I didn't abandon you!
What if you had a friend that you could discuss chaos-based magic with?
Would that mean we weren't friends anymore?
More like a lot of skoshes!
Tree Hugger, could you give us a minute?
Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology?
Not me!
They're probably just as nervous as you are.
Thank goodness.
It's not very good.
You can do it!
Angel and I searched the forest, but...
Don't worry, Twilight.
I'm sure she's trying her best.
I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.
With exactly what kind of parties we like.
Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing...
But she's afraid of quesadillas.
What matters is how hard you tried.
So, um, do we walk back up the slide or...
or what?
[tired throughout]
A grooming day for our pets really was a great idea.
[yawns]
I even went to bed early last night...
but then I had a really scary nightmare.
I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too!
Wow.
That was fast.
But how did it get into ours?
Mmm, it's so nice to be the pet for once.
N-n-n-n-nice...
giant...
evil Angel...
[screams]
Phew!
Oh, thank you, princess!
That...
that was terrible!
I-I never want to have that nightmare again!
Oh, no!
But how?
The Tantabus was able to escape Luna when it only had six dreams it could get to!
Well, it is worth a try, isn't it?
Please, we need your help too!
But why would you do that?
Shh!
It's lovely.
Oh, certainly.
Aww, look at the cute little ant farm!
I'm sure Shining Armor will love it.
I would say...
You were in such a rush earlier.
Twilight wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for Shining Armor and Cadance's visit.
You know, maybe some baby carrots...
Baby carrots!
They're Shining Armor's favorite.
Where?
Is it Albert?
We're here to listen.
Wow, Pinkie.
I never knew you knew so much about town hall.
Oh, you're so cute.
Fuzzy Legs, do you think you could secure those windows?
And you'll alert me if anything scary comes close to the cottage?
Oh, who am I kidding?
When something scary comes close to the cottage!
Please tell me my hiding place is ready.
Oh, look, you've filled it with everything I need to survive this awful night.
Thank you.
Thank you all!
Now I don't have to step a hoof outside until this whole thing is over.
Oh, no!
You don't have any carrots?
Do we have any other fresh veggies you may enjoy?
Or maybe some hay?
But that means I'll need to go out...
on Nightmare Night!
[screams]
[gasps]
How could I forget?
Oh, I don't suppose I could borrow a few pieces of hay from you?
I forgot to stock up on food for Angel, and you do seem to have quite a lot.
Oh, I'm sure I don't.
I don't know.
Is it?
B-B-B-B-Bones?
Please tell me they're grapes!
[frightened sobs]
Twilight?
Hello?
[screams]
That's okay.
I'll take your word for it.
That I foolishly forgot to stock up on food for Angel and had to go out to get him something but got spooked in town so I came here hoping Twilight had some lettuce I could give him?
Goodness, no!
I couldn't be out tonight.
I just couldn't.
I guess that is true.
You think so?
Hi, everypony.
Everything is fine.
In fact, it's more than fine.
I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities.
Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning.
But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony.
If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it.
Oh, right.
The maze.
Oh, I am!
I am ready to take on Nightmare Night!
[giggles]
Just practicing.
[nervous laugh]
What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly?
All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip!
A mask?
They can just be so difficult to see out of.
W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me?
What if I just wear the dress?
I'm wearing it.
Close.
I'm going to a masquerade ball.
Without the mask.
Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself.
[gulps]
It's just that, um...
What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears?
How would I even hear to know I was under attack?
It is?
Well, it's just...
What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help?
Oh, goodness.
We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I?
I really wanna do this.
But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight.
I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me.
Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night!
I think I do!
And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the perfect idea for how I'm gonna do it!
Meet me at my cottage in an hour.
Oh, I'm excited to see everypony soon!
Welcome to Fluttershy's tea party!
Have a seat.
Don't be scared of what awaits you.
Go on.
Pass the sugar.
Oh, no!
There is none!
You're a terrible host!
Rarity, put your coat on!
You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss!
Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches!
That's right.
Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup.
A friend who didn't come through.
That must scare you to the coooore.
Quick, everypony, look behind you!
They're unplanned guests.
Your woooorst nightmare.
You don't have enough food for them!
Oh, no!
There's a tiny kitten that needs a home!
But you are over-scheduled right now.
You don't have time to help!
I said, You don't have time to help!
This should appear to scare you!
Why don't you look terrified?
You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you.
Can you imagine anything more upsetting?
Oh, I'm just not cut out for this.
Just go on without me.
You have to.
This is the night you look forward to all year.
It's okay.
I really want you all to have fun.
This is how I spend every Nightmare Night.
Please go.
I'll be fine.
I did try my hardest.
Or...
maybe not.
I suppose I could have gone with something a bit scarier.
You're right!
I've been taking baby steps!
I think it's time for grown up ones!
I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that?
Oh, my!
I'm so, so sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?
After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night.
So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends.
I had some help.
Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze.
Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move.
And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster.
We could celebrate Nightmare Night together every year.
But the truth is I really don't want to.
Yes, but I've also realized something.
You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not.
I really don't like it.
It's just not my cup of tea.
Just regular tea.
We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them.
Actually, I'm not afraid.
I'm perfectly fine with it.
[sighs]
I don't know why I doubted myself for a second.
Now this is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night.
Hi, Twilight!
Hi, Spike!
How was your book-sort-cation?
[giggles]
Orange you glad you did it?
Oh, please.
You'll make me blush.
We would've invited you to come along too, but we didn't want to interrupt your organizing.
We know how important it is to you.
I think it was a garden hose.
A hose!
I guess you had to be there.
Ooh.
Um, I've noticed a couple of things.
Absolutely.
Or maybe it's more of a non-adventure.
Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went?
Twilight, how could you say such a thing?
I know Discord still makes mistakes sometimes, but you're accusing him of being downright evil!
We're sorry if we made you feel left out.
Does everyanimal have their copy of Wuthering Hooves?
Hooray!
I love Furry Friends Book Club!
Now, let's discuss the theme of nature as it applies to Hoofcliff's love.
Did somepony leave a light on?
Oh, it's me.
It's me!
We'll continue this discussion when I get back!
You were called, too!
Thank goodness.
I feel so much better going with a friend.
Ever since the map called us?
But that happened five minutes ago.
Oh, I'm so lucky I'm being sent with you.
Speaking of which, where are we going?
Oh, I've never been there before.
That's gorgeous.
And where there's nature, there's a ton of animal friends!
You seem pretty prepared to me.
Are those for us?
You said books twice.
Ooh!
I don't know.
[grunts]
But I'm sure we'll figure it out.
[grunts]
I'm sure we'll find out when we get there.
We'll know very, very soon.
Since we're almost there.
[groans]
[sighs]
Thank you.
Whoa!
It's nothing like your book said it would be!
Maybe by figuring out where the flying pumpkins are coming from?
Yes, but, um, why are you...
pumpkining your neighbors?
I'm Fluttershy, and...
um...
I'm here, too.
Oh, no!
Good plan.
That's why she's the princess.
And I'm Fluttershy.
I'd love to.
But if we solved the problem already, shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again?
I guess we should find out why the Hooffields are launching tomatoes now.
Bleh!
[gasps]
It was a good plan.
We need to think of another one.
And soon.
This fight is really affecting the animals around here.
What do you hope to get out of fighting?
The best at what?
Ooh!
Maybe somepony just needs to say they're sorry.
Nothing says let's be friends like a cake that says, Let's be friends!
I wrote that in icing on the top.
Um, if you could just not yell so much or maybe stop saying words altogether...
Wah!
Twilight?
Um, Twilight?
We should probably get back there.
I mean, if you need a break, that's fine, but I really can't do this without you.
Hey, little fellas.
Oh, that's okay, you can come out.
Oh, you poor things!
There isn't enough food here for you!
Oh, brrr, and you're freezing!
I'm gonna take you all home with me and get you all hot cocoas.
How do you feel about book clubs?
What's that?
Uh-huh...
Twilight!
They know what happened here!
Before you keep fighting, there is something you should know!
Long ago, there were two best friends... Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt.
When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special.
So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants.
But they disagreed on how to go about it.
Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat.
But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind.
The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm!
Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops!
They kept fighting back and forth, until it turned into a feud!
The valley suffered from the constant destruction, until finally the Hooffields and McColts moved to separate mountains.
Even then, the valley and all the animals in it continued to be caught in the crossfire.
You see?
By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place!
So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together!
If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys!
They say they accept your apology.
Yay!
I told you we'd figure it out.
Oof!
I'm sure we'll find out when we get home...
All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be...
destroyed!
All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be...
destroyed!
The servants of Chrysalis will do anything to save their evil skins!
Why would she ever trust you?
Is everypony okay?
But, um, shouldn't we wait for the invitation?
And the Crystal Heart.
That's not very reassuring.
I can only imagine.
Um, Rarity, don't they all sort of look the same?
Still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back, like...
inside your house?
I really don't think it's going to happen.
[sighs]
[faints]
That's really great.
I know how long you've been waiting for a spot to open up.
I hope everything goes well.
Sounds like an awful lot of pressure having to learn everything so quickly.
Um, is something wrong, Rainbow Dash?
Oh, no!
Isn't that the same terrible nickname those bullies in flight school used to call you?
We should all remember to be extra supportive for Rainbow Dash too.
I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie are done getting their snacks, or they're gonna miss Rainbow Dash!
Was it the eggnog?
Oh, I knew I put in too much cinnamon!
And ends with Frost?
I think a perfect Equestria looks a lot like a Hearth's Warming Eve party.
Snowfall Frost?
I just hope it doesn't end up being an article about how her friends almost ruined the opening.
But?
I wish it had been more fettered.
Um, it didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but it, um, started out all right.
Aw, hello.
Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan.
Then Smoky Jr.
found a nice home in the crawl space behind the building.
But Mr Stripes demolished it, so they were temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live.
Of course.
Hello, Smoky, Softpad, Smoky Jr.
I have some...
interesting news.
I, oh...
I'd like you all to stay here forever, but...
What would Rarity want?
You have to move out!
[sobs]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
When you write the story, could you maybe skip over the part where we locked Rarity in the window display?
[nervous chuckle]
I asked the raccoons to leave.
I'm sorry I asked you to leave.
The place is yours if you wanna stay.
Though I would like to ask you all just one favor.
After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help!
I'm so glad you asked.
Oh, no!
Not again!
[groans]
I'm just surprised.
When you left, you said mane therapy was your calling.
What went wrong?
Um, Mom, Dad, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm not so sure letting Zephyr move back home is a good idea.
I know you both want to help, but don't you remember last time?
[sighs]
I know.
It just seems like his place always ends up being your place.
And then he sort of makes you do everything for him!
Well, maybe if you stuck with it for more than a few weeks...
I'm sorry, but I am just so...
so...
peeved right now!
[gasps]
Excuse my language!
Oh, um, sorry about that.
Zephyr's my brother, and I love him.
But he's never learned to do anything for himself.
I don't know why my parents keep letting him trot all over them!
You know, you're right!
[inhales and exhales]
[gasps]
Zephyr Breeze!
Can't you see what you're doing?
I'm talking about Mom's flowers!
And Dad's been collecting his favorite bits of cloud from the factory since before you were born.
You can't just fly in and change everything Mom and Dad have built here.
I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me, but Zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you.
I agree.
Which is why you should move out.
I'm not sure.
Oh, I hope I did the right thing...
Um, Zephyr.
When Mom and Dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here.
You said you had plenty of places to go!
[sighs]
Fine.
You can stay here?
On one condition.
You have to get a job.
[through gritted teeth]
Zephyr Breeze...
Remember how we talked about you getting a job?
I thought you might say that.
So I did it for you.
Good luck!
Thanks for giving my brother a job.
I just hope he's up to the task.
What did you do?
[giggles nervously]
Actually, I said I was going to tea with the princess.
You're going to work.
Where's Spike?
You didn't do it at all!
[inhales]
Well, I guarantee there won't be any fooling around on the next job.
So you just quit?
Again?
Keep trying?
Finish something for once?
Maybe that way, you'd actually find something you like to do!
Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I don't think you can live here.
I guess so...
Oh, hello, Constance!
Oh, dear.
Oh...
I can't let him live like this.
Zephyr, you're smart and talented.
You could do anything if you just tried!
And I was worried that I'd fail every time!
Sometimes you have to do things, even though you might fail.
And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it?
So here's the deal: You can come back with me, but you have to do exactly what I say.
No exceptions.
Okay, you know what you have to do, right?
I knew you could do it, Zephyr.
That's what big sisters are for.
Have you heard from Zephyr?
Is he doing well?
I'm so proud of you, Zephyr.
Oh, I just gave you some encouragement.
You did this on your own.
I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic.
I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark.
But there's really nothing to be afraid of.
The forest at night is the same as the forest during the day.
Only...
darker.
Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage.
Nothing to worry about.
No reason to...
Ruuuun!
Aah!
[screams]
That wasn't funny!
You really scared me!
I hope you're happy.
That's not true.
Aah!
Because I don't think being scared is very fun!
Did she get you, too?
Cooooooookies...
Without thinking about how it might make them feel?
Well, I hope you learned your lesson.
[gasps]
Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan.
I just found out.
If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac.
They're very nice.
They have a top secret thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville.
Although everypony knows about it, so it's not a very good secret.
I think you'd have fun with them.
All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends.
Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
It never hurts to make new friends.
[gasps]
Discord...
Wow, Rainbow Dash.
You sure seem to know a lot about this game.
I've never even heard of...
buckball.
But, um, we don't have a team.
Aah!
Oh, I don't know.
That ball moves pretty fast.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whee!
[giggles]
Ooh!
[giggles]
It actually is kinda fun!
Well, hello there, Mr Ball.
Whee!
Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you.
This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Wow, Snails.
You're a natural at buckball.
Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team?
W-What do you mean?
I thought you and Dash were gonna play.
Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just having fun.
Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time.
Serious?
[gulps]
Wow.
This looks pretty intense.
I-I-I do?
[gasps, gasps loudly, gasps, whimpers]
[gasps]
Whoa!
[gasps]
Whoa!
Ugh!
Whoa!
Aah!
[gasps]
[gasps]
Maybe we just need a little rest.
I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident.
[groans]
I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball?
Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa?
[nervous]
It should...
I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it.
Do you?
There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore!
Maybe you need to look again!
And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa!
Oh...
we're sorry to let you down.
But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa.
We don't?
Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us.
We've been playing just awful.
[nervous whimper]
[grunts]
Huh!
Looks like you two really do need practice!
If you need more practice, we can keep going.
But, um, why were we so terrible before?
But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down.
But how do we keep from worrying about it?
So is that Pegasus.
Oh, I don't know if we can win.
Oh, I wouldn't get too serious.
Las Pegasus?
All those lights and sounds, not to mention the crowds...
Oh, just the thought of it is overwhelming!
Uh, Applejack?
It isn't as bad as we thought.
Do you think the map could be on the fritz again?
I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even Rainbow Dash.
Wow.
This Gladmane sure seems impressive.
You know who we are?
We do have a friendship problem to find.
[gasps]
I've never seen a pink prairie dog before!
Now this place is overwhelming in a good way!
Hmm?
Oh, um, coming!
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all.
Those voices sound familiar.
They certainly don't seem to be getting along.
[gasps]
You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them?
I know you and the rest of the Apple family have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is important, no matter who's having it.
I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam...
[sighs]
I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other.
[sighs]
If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place!
It certainly isn't for Gladmane.
Sounds like he's better off with them fighting.
Do you think he knows?
Well, Bernard ?
that adorable bunny from the acrobat's act ?
claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the star that the director wants to get rid of her!
But neither is true!
And the Flying Prairinos ?
the pink prairie dog family ?
say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer think the other is doing it!
But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing?
Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a trickster.
Or maybe a pair of ponies?
But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems.
How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours?
Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort.
Are all of you sure this is a good idea?
Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along!
It's just... mean!
Did that sound okay?
I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all.
If it weren't for your history with Flim and Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing.
What do you mean?
Oh, um, whatever you think is best.
It might depend on the animal.
For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing might be better off up in one of the towers.
And these adorable little chipmunks might prefer a nook somewhere.
Maybe if you spend some time getting to know?
They ran away.
Because you didn't ask me to.
All the animals.
Got it.
I gathered all of the animals like you asked, Starlight Glimmer.
I was up all night calming the animals down.
Seems like she feels pretty bad.
Oh, and I feel awful for disturbing all of those cute little spiders and bats.
I should check on them.
I don't think they would've sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come.
I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.
...Applejack for friendship business.
[whimpers]
Please, help!
[whimpers]
Discord!
I'm stuck!
But what?
You're right.
There's no way you should trust me.
Just go find the others.
I understand!
It's, um, good to see you, too.
Uh, everypony?
Oh, boy!
I'm just happy to be with all of you.
I've got the key!
We learned about team building and problem solving...
Be careful!
[whimpers]
[gasps]
Are you okay, Angel?
I told you that entering the Ponyville Parkour Contest was a dangerous idea.
You just rest here, and I'll have you all fixed up in no time.
Oh, dear.
I'm all out of bunny foot braces.
I think we need to pay a visit to Dr.
Fauna.
Oh, I was sure she would be here today.
Hello?
[knocks on door]
Is anypony there?
I wish I could say the same, but the door's stuck, so I, um...
can't see you.
[gasps]
You really have your hooves full here.
I just can't believe all these poor little animals are hurt.
What happened?
Oh, dear.
They do seem to have made themselves right at home here.
Don't be silly, Dr.
Fauna.
You're the best vet pony in Equestria.
At least that's what I've been telling everypony.
Oh, no.
Do you suppose it's my fault?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care.
That is a big problem...
that I'm going to fix for you!
I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy and give you more space.
Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!
I'm on it!
I want to thank you all for rushing right over when I called.
Fauna needs my help with a serious problem.
Her vet clinic is a bit...
maybe, um...
overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and...
they don't have anywhere to go!
I know!
Oh, that's great news!
Because it means you'll all be helping me with something special, too.
Something that's been a dream of mine for a long time.
Um, no.
Not exactly.
My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.
A beautiful habitat where every animal ?
whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy ?
every critter would be welcome.
My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world.
Oh, thank you, everypony.
You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years.
It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality.
But I can't build the sanctuary alone.
Will you join me?
How lovely!
Is it you, Rarity?
Wow, everypony!
Thank you!
I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas.
We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!
Thank you, Rupert.
Ahem.
It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project.
My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents.
This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me.
I-I think so.
Of course.
Um, not exactly.
It's more of a dream board.
Well, that's because it's not.
It's a sanctuary.
A place that is safe but not restrictive.
Cozy but natural.
A place where the animals can come and go as they please.
So, can you build it?
I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan.
No walls.
More like an enclosure that melts into the trees.
With a gate in the back.
That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready.
But I don't want to clear the trees.
I want to use them.
Critters don't live the same way ponies do.
I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before.
I really believe it'll work.
Good.
Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake.
We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary.
Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies.
Drab?
You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?
I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents.
Thank you.
Hmm.
I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug.
Maybe if we lose that part.
Exactly!
Ooh!
This is the perfect base for a little nest.
I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.
No cages.
I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go.
It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.
[gasps]
I...
I...
[angry]
I don't love it!
This is not going to work at all!
A giraffe can't fit through this door!
With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine?
And this is the opposite of a nice hug!
I know you all worked hard, but none of you did anything I asked for!
I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I am an expert at one thing: the care of animals!
And what animals need is a sanctuary, not this!
My vision isn't the problem here!
I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me!
So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!
Oh, um, actually, it's, uh, not ready and...
[gasps]
[gasps]
I'm the one who should be sorry.
This didn't go at all like I had imagined.
Sleep tight, little one.
It's going to be okay.
I promise.
Now, now, every mouse has gotta wait their turn.
[sighs]
I'm so sorry.
I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now.
But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.
I won't give up!
These animals need me!
And I'm gonna solve this once and for all!
If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, I can find a way to build her a safe place to rest!
[joins in laughter]
Oops.
Everyone back to sleep now.
Thanks for coming, everypony.
As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned.
It's okay.
You were all just trying to help.
But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.
Try again.
I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it my way this time.
Everypony, stop!
I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine.
Other ponies may be experts in their fields, but animals are my field of expertise.
And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen!
Oh, um, for the animals of course.
To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend.
He'll be here any minute.
This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first.
Plus there's nopony better at building.
And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings and caring for animals.
Are you ready?
Okay, you can open your eyes!
Welcome to Sweet Feather Sanctuary, a safe and cozy retreat for everycreature!
Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic.
Because once you've treated them, they can recover here!
With my help, of course.
It's okay, Lola.
We all move at our own pace.
Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams.
And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined!
Fostering friendships is what ponies do.
Why not?
Care for a carrot-ginger sandwich?
Of course I did.
I know how you like them.
[giggles]
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to be out.
Oh, that's all right.
I need to go to the market anyway.
I have to restock my pantry for our tea party next week.
Oh, it's really not that much.
Are you sure?
I wouldn't want you to go through any trouble.
Then count me in.
I'm already looking forward to it.
Sounds good to me.
You know, Discord, I've never been to your house before.
Uh, Discord?
Before you go, would you mind helping me tidy up?
[giggles]
Discord!
I'm so excited to finally see where you live!
I can't wait to see how...
uh...
Um, no, no, not at all.
It's just not what I expected.
It's quite...
lovely.
Where is it?
Oooh!
Does it actually turn us green?
Is it really envious of the other teas?
What's it do, what's it do?
Oh...
Okay.
Yes...
Yes, we are.
Uh-huh...
Uh, Discord, you don't seem to be yourself today.
Are you feeling all right?
Well, it's just...
what you're wearing.
And also what you're saying.
And also the way you're saying it.
And, um, pretty much everything else.
Uh, what's going on?
[gasps]
Discord!
You're starting to fade away!
What is wrong with you?
You're acting so normal, which is not so normal for you!
No, it's not!
It's you being like everypony else!
Eeeek!
The more you do it, the more you fade away!
Of course!
You're a creature of pure chaos!
Being normal is destroying you!
Stop it!
Please!
You need to go back to being your not-normal normal self!
Quick, Discord!
Uh, do something chaotic before it's too late!
Please!
[whimpers]
Then I guess it's up to me.
[whimpers]
Okay.
All right.
How about...
Oh, no!
I tipped over that cup!
That's pretty chaotic, right?
[whimpers]
What if I...
[chomping, mouth full]
Oh, my!
Talking with food in my mouth after taking a bite from every sandwich!
[gulps]
How wacky!
Doing anything for ya?
[whimpers]
Okay.
Hmm.
Maybe I need to start thinking like you.
Ohhh...
What would Discord do?
Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of.
But one wouldn't be enough.
He'd need more!
Way more!
Hey there, Fluttershys!
Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party?
Hi, Fluttershy!
Thanks for asking!
First of all, you gotta redecorate this place.
I mean, this is where Discord lives!
And you're telling me there aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere?
On it!
Better...
but it still needs something.
Now, that's more like it!
[gasps]
It's working!
Okay, what else?
Furniture on the ground?
So predictable!
Let's put them where they don't belong!
And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you!
Because he's funny like that!
Bet you can't catch me!
And Discord would have a special kind of tea!
Like a ginseng that could really sing!
And he'd serve it on a floating table!
We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!
[laughs]
Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!
I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would.
We're different!
What?
Why would you ever think that?
That may be true, but we make sense to me.
I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you.
But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me.
Of course I do, silly!
Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?
Now, about that tea party...
You know, your garden really is looking lovely.
Gesundheit.
I'm happy to be here.
And I really do like your place.
Because it's so you.
Now, how about we try some of those delicious-looking sandwiches?
What is it, Twilight?
Do I need to prepare myself?
I, uh, wanted to leave room for all of you.
Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson.
Well, I think that's a great idea.
Please, just leave me alone!
It's okay.
I got this, girls.
[inhales]
Listen up!
I am more assertive!
And yes, it took me a while to get there.
But can you honestly say that you could learn something one time and completely change who you are?
I didn't think so.
[sighs]
I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have to defend myself one more time!
And we can't change the way other ponies think about us.
But we can change how we let it affect us.
We could, um, try.
There!
I guess it's harder for her when she feels like the lemon.
What facts are those?
A friend who made us all feel beautiful in her lovely creations.
And explained just how beautiful we thought you were.
Inside and out.
Thank you so much, Zecora.
I never would've found the crisscross moss without you.
Oh, but the oxen visiting Sweet Feather Sanctuary next week will surely appreciate it.
It really adds a shine to their coat.
Gee, I don't know.
It's a pretty big pack.
So maybe enough to fill up this sack?
[gasps, laughs]
Oh, my!
You're rubbing off on me, Zecora!
[screams]
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!
Zecora, are you all right?
[gasps]
What's happening to you?
[gasps deeply]
Do you think it's serious, doctor?
I can't believe a flower did this.
I take back thinking it was pretty!
Phew.
[gasps loudly]
Zecora, this is all my fault!
If you hadn't been helping me get the crisscross moss, you wouldn't have gotten Swamp Fever.
I'm so sorry.
I refuse to accept that!
There has to be somepony who can help you!
The Mystical Mask!
Of course!
My parents would tell me about her whenever I was sick in bed.
If that's who we need to cure you, then I'm going to find her!
And I know just the pony who can help!
[pants]
Twilight?
Twilight?
Twilight!
Oh, I'm so sorry to bother?
Are...
Are you cooking?
[grunts, gulps, grunts, gulps]
Um, they're both delicious, but...
Zecora-has-Swamp-Fever-and-there's-no-cure-and-it's-all-my-fault-and-the-only-pony-who-can-cure-it-is-the-Mystical-Mask-and-I-need-your-help-to-find-her!
Hmm.
Did we check the unabridged versions?
Well, we might have to look through every book in the entire library, but I know we'll figure it out.
[sighs]
Another dead end.
Have you found anything yet, Twilight?
Twilight?
Goodness!
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
Oh, no-no-no.
I meant you should sleep.
I can't rest until Zecora is healed.
Mm-hmm.
Twilight!
Sorry, but I figured out who the Mystical Mask is!
All I had to do was cross-reference a book about masks with another book on ancient Equestrian healers, then use a third book to translate it all from Olde Ponish, and there it was!
Zecora was right!
The Mystical Mask wasn't just a legend.
The Mystical Mask was Mage Meadowbrook!
Absolutely!
Mage Meadowbrook wasn't just a sorceress.
She was also a healer, and back then, healers wore masks so they wouldn't get sick themselves!
Mm-hmm.
But if we go to Hayseed Swamp, maybe we can find something she left behind!
Something that could lead to a cure!
We have to try!
I've got a route all planned out, and on the way, we can check up on Zecora, and then?
Of course!
Every second we spend waiting is a second Zecora is coughing bubbles!
There's no use trying to talk me out of this, Twilight!
[grunts]
We've got no time to waste!
I packed cauliflower bites.
And that's when I realized the Mystical Mask was actually Mage Meadowbrook!
[gasps]
Oh, no.
Zecora, you didn't rhyme!
You must be getting worse.
[gasps]
That's it!
We have to go now!
[groans]
[yawns]
I'm not sure.
Maybe there's somepony we can ask.
Wait!
I recognize that tree!
[gasps]
Yes!
This has to be it!
It's just like the illustrations of her home!
[grunts]
Phew.
Well, if the doorway is sealed up, we'll just have to dig our way in.
Back up, Twilight!
I don't want you to get hurt!
[laughs nervously]
It really blends in with the bark.
Wow.
It looks like this place has been abandoned for years.
[gasps]
Twilight, look!
It's the same kind of lilypad that gave Zecora Swamp Fever!
Hmm.
I wonder if Meadowbrook was looking for a cure for Swamp Fever, too.
[gasps]
Do you think she found it?
Uh, I wasn't making my excited squeaking noise.
Likewise, but, um, may I ask, why are you in Mage Meadowbrook's home?
[gasps]
You're related to Mage Meadowbrook?
Oh, my goodness, Twilight, we did it!
Not only did we find Mage Meadowbrook's old house ?
we actually found one of her descendants!
This is good.
It'll take us less time to go through everything.
Today, my mom made me eat peas.
Peas are yucky.
And we can probably skip this one, unless she found a cure when she was a foal.
Wait!
Listen to this!
Today, I tried again to brew an unsniffle elixir...
It was the greatest feeling I've ever experienced, and I promise to dedicate my life to curing ponies all over Equestria!
So all we have to do is find those aggressive flash bees and get them to give us their honey!
Of course, it doesn't say how she did that...
What?
Is my mane messy?
I know I haven't slept in a while, but...
[gasps]
Oh, no!
I've caught Swamp Fever!
Huh?
What?
Yes!
I won't risk infecting you or Cattail!
[coughs]
Um, you don't know this about me, but I'm pretty good with animals.
And besides, Dogtail?
Um, Zecora is counting on me.
I have to help her, just like Meadowbrook helped her mother and all those bayou ponies long ago!
You're not gonna change my mind, Twilight!
It's too dangerous, Twilight.
Besides, I've already gotten one friend hurt.
I won't let it happen to another.
[exhales]
Okay, Fluttershy, you can do this!
[coughs]
Mind over matter!
[grunts]
Hello, flash bees!
I was hoping I could get some of your honey.
I see.
You don't let others have any.
Well, I'm sorry, but I really need it.
[squeaks]
I didn't want it to have to come to this, but I'll just have to use...
the Stare!
[shrieks]
[coughs]
You really are aggressive!
[coughs]
Oh, dear.
[whimpers]
[groans]
What happened?
Where am I?
Goodness gracious!
[coughs]
Have you heard from Zecora?
Is she okay?
She's already turning into a tree?
I thought we'd have more time!
Three days?
Oh, dear.
We have to get back to the hive!
I've wasted so much time, and?
Wait...
Disguises...
[gasps]
That's it!
I know how she did it!
I know how Meadowbrook got the honey!
This is how Meadowbrook got the honey from the flash bees!
The male bees aren't aggressive around the queen bee, and this mask has the same stripes that she does.
[sneezes]
There's no time to waste!
[coughs]
Mind over matter!
Twilight...
It's working!
Oh, you're rhyming again!
Welcome back, my friend!
Oh, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been sick in the first place.
That's true.
I certainly learned that if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to take care of anypony else.
In fact, if I had rested like Twilight had suggested all along, maybe I would have thought to use Meadowbrook's mask sooner.
But what happened to them all?
What is it?
Even then, I'm not sure we'd find out what happened here over a thousand years ago.
The Pony of Shadows must have been really awful for them to do that.
How would we know what to look for?
Or where?
Meadowbrook's mask!
Just remember not to turn away from them, Cattail.
Flash bees can get pretty aggressive.
I guess that's why none of the other bayou animals can get to the water.
It would...
if I didn't have to fly up here to move their hive.
There!
Now the other bayou creatures can get to the water without the bees feeling threatened.
I know.
[giggles]
But I couldn't leave without helping.
Or move a flash beehive.
Over a thousand years.
They'd be gone...
forever?
The Appeloosian Wastes sure sounded dark and desolate.
Isn't there some way to banish him without losing all of you?
Mm-hmm!
Maybe because we used them for healing magic instead of banishing?
I hope not.
I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much.
Um, hello there.
I'm your teacher.
I hope you enjoy class.
But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too.
No, but changelings can turn into ponies.
Even if those guidelines aren't working?
This way, Angel!
Oh, my!
What are you all doing?
Aren't classes that way?
Oh, that sounds nice.
Have fun!
Whenever I'm sad, a hug from Angel Bunny always makes me feel better.
Uh...
Maybe it's just me.
[laughs nervously]
Oh, no.
No more scary pop quizzes?
The creatures from the other kingdoms seemed pretty upset with us.
We would be really happy if you sent your student back to class.
[gasps]
Shrimps can attack?
Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students...
and he just got plenty of cupcakes.
Don't hurt them!
Just ask them to leave nicely.
And without the EEA?
it'll be much friendlier.
Don't worry, Angel, I won't forget you.
[sighs]
There's nothing so peaceful as a cuddly friends picnic.
Oh, goodness, Rarity!
What's the matter?
Oh, dear.
Do you wanna have some lettuce and talk about it?
Oh, that sounds serious.
Do you need help knitting?
I've started making tea cozies.
It's an elephant.
All three?
Does that mean you'll have to close Rarity For You?
Of course.
I'm happy to help.
Though I'm surprised you picked me.
I think I forgot how big this shop was.
How do you find anything?
[gasps]
It is?
Um, okay.
Hello.
Um, welcome to Rarity For You.
What can I help you with?
Um, aren't all those things opposites?
But how can I?
But I just, um?
Wow.
You make it look so easy.
I guess not.
How?
You're not gonna be here?
In your work room?
[gulps]
Smoky!
Softpad!
Smoky Jr.
[giggles]
And I'm sure they'll help me let my inner strength shine through!
Um, who says that?
[sighs]
I hope she's right.
Whew.
Here goes nothing.
Welcome to Rarity For You.
What can I help you with?
Um, thread...
count?
Um...
Well, I'm not sure.
Let's see...
Um, one, two, three, four...
Um, excuse me for just one second.
[pants]
Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers.
What am I gonna do?
Oh, I've never tried to act before, but...
I suppose it's worth a shot.
Severe but not unapproachable.
Acceptable business attire.
Oh, does that sound like a shop pony to you?
So sorry for the wait.
The shop has some...
staffing issues today.
Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it will make you the envy of all who see it.
Ta-ta!
Smoky Jr.
I can't believe it worked!
I suppose clothes really do make the pony after all.
It's an unique play on the old standard.
We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.
If I had meant chevron, then that's what I would've said.
Aw, thanks, everyone.
But I feel I should push the snootiness further.
If you really wanna help, I suppose serving tea would be nice.
Oh, if you don't mind.
I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... modelle.
Perhaps... pointy.
Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there.
Yes.
Casual chic prˆt-…-porter is very branch‚ this season.
Um, one moment, please.
Oh, I think I need a new character.
Okay, I've got, like, this high-key savage look for you?
It's a totally live ensemble with a little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, Whoa!
That pony is 'woke'!
Can you, like, chill for one sec?
BRB.
It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help.
This tea must always be at a precise temperature!
See that it doesn't happen again!
Whoa, that color is, like, almost too lit for you?
The blackness of this vest is a reflection of your soul.
This hemline is nothing short of an inspiration of craftsponyship.
Are you sure you deserve it?
[gasps]
I don't know what's worse ?
that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold!
Either get it right or go back to the forest!
Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days.
I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even more matronly, but here you are.
It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless.
I would srsly help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?
If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of one customer at a time.
You'll have to wait your turn.
Ugh, honestly!
These small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any way they please!
Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us.
They should have, like, stayed there?
The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now.
Goodness!
You are so right.
Please, step this way so that we may discuss your concerns.
Indeed.
Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.
Ugh!
Your style isn't even on the same page?
Turn away.
Don't even look at it, okay?
I think not, dear!
This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of you!
Rarity!
I'm so glad you're here!
Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!
You, like, totally get how lame customers are?
Ugh!
Watching them leave filled me with a sweet sadness.
And you'll be pleased to hear that I've taken care of your rodent situation.
Well!
Good luck replacing me!
Humph!
I always thought she was too controlling.
Whatever.
I know, right?
I mean, uh, ugh?
Like, okay.
I guess I owe everypony an apology.
I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that?
I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
You know I was only pretending, right?
I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.
Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony.
Oh, it's lovely, Rarity!
I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early.
Have you considered the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair here?
Hmm?
Have you?
Hmmm?
Hmph!
Just as I thought!
Hmmm!
[giggles]
Inner strength.
Once you get past terrifying, paralyzing stage fright, the rest is easy.
Now I just hope Princess Celestia says we can do our play.
You...
You really think so?
Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship.
Raising the sun every morning was so hard, it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.
And every day, the unicorns helping Star Swirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers forever.
Things looked bleak.
Soon, Equestria would lose all its magic users!
Then, the land would be covered in darkness for eternity!
But then, a student named Celestia discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself without draining her magic!
And she won't be embarrassed!
But how?
Ponies are taking their seats for the show.
Oh, my.
Playing you?
While you watch me playing you?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I think my stage fright is coming back.
It's time for a new day in Equestria!
I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be in it.
Oh, my!
I don't know how I keep winning.
[giggles]
Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
All right, students!
It's time to meet some new friends!
Ooh.
I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this.
Goodness.
They seem really upset.
Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends.
Um, where are we camping?
Oh, no!
You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated?
That's terrible!
Here.
I'm sure your home isn't too far away.
Right where you belong.
Oh, dear.
This isn't where I belong.
Oh, Rainbow Dash!
I'm so glad you're here.
I was lost.
What just happened?
Hello again, little friend.
I think I may be walking in circles.
[gasps]
Oh, my!
Where did you learn that kind of language?
Um, excuse me?
Everycreature is mad at me!
Can't we all just get along?
Friends?
You left me alone in the woods!
If everypony likes me again.
It must be a really important one.
Should we send our students home?
Huh?
[gasps]
Some poor creature's in trouble!
We have to help it!
Oh, listen to that suffering!
It must be in horrible agony!
Ooh!
It sounds like a herd of injured chimerae!
[pants]
Or it's Cerberus with snifflitis in two of its heads and kennel cough in its third.
Or maybe it's?
Pinkie Pie?
Ugh.
At least no animal is suffering.
Right, Angel?
[laughs nervously]
Well, until now.
[sighs, to Angel Bunny]
It's okay.
She's gone.
[snores, gasps]
So very tired.
It practically took me all night to get the nursery back to sleep.
Wow.
She took that so much better than I thought.
[slurps]
That's a wonderful idea!
If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie.
I could...
if he was talking.
Have you seen Pinkie Pie?
[tearing up]
But...
we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!
But where?
[hushed, gasps]
There she is!
Oh, I can't bear to see her like this.
Maybe not.
Look!
Playing makes you happy.
None of the other Pillars seem to be having trouble fitting into the modern world.
[gasps]
That is special.
The Peaks of...
P-P-Peril?
Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?
[shudders]
Maybe you should go instead of me, Twilight.
[laughs nervously]
[laughs nervously]
Maybe they know something we don't?
[screams]
You really startled us.
There.
That should be enough flowers to keep your tree cozy.
Yes, but actua?
I know, but what I found out is that?
Applejack!
Can you please listen to me?
[clears throat]
What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.
That's all right.
If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day.
Heh.
[giggles]
I hope that's not a Nirik!
[gasps]
[shudders]
If you have any friendship problems, we're here to help.
[whispering, to Applejack]
Maybe they don't understand us.
But you don't speak?
Will you excuse us for a moment?
You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer.
Not exactly.
I can always tell what Angel is feeling.
But these Kirin don't show anything.
Gesundheit.
A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?
Phew!
Be careful.
And watch out for Niriks!
[giggles]
Oh, no-no-no-no-no!
We can't ever let that happen!
The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind.
But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!
The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village.
So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again.
Yes, it is!
Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this.
Why, think of all the animals it could hurt.
And how can you be sure that won't happen?
Applejack!
You're not listening!
Um, what are they doing?
[grunts]
Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.
W-Where are they taking us?
She talks?
Well, thank you for that...
um, wall of fire.
But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry.
How did you know you could control your temper?
I never thought of it that way.
I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.
Everypony gets mad sometimes.
Even Applejack and I argue.
[clears throat]
On the way here?
And about the Kirin being silent?
And right now!
And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony.
That's wonderful!
Uh, isn't it?
Are you sure?
Hmm.
I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
I've never heard of that.
[gasps]
He says he knows where to find more foal's-breath!
[gasps]
That's what foal's-breath looks like?
Why?
And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it.
I can't watch!
Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
Rarity ran into the door.
[gasps]
Tirek!
[gasps]
Oh, no!
Um, we didn't.
They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold.
Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat.
Um, what does it do?
I think he lost his magic, too.
All the creatures here must have.
I'll talk to him.
Um, excuse me, puppy?
You're a very good guard dog.
Yes, you are.
But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek.
Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name?
I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?
Um, are you sure there's magic in Cerberus?
Clarissa the pig has two tails, and while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical.
I'm sure I can get the other monsters to help.
[whispering, to Spike]
Besides, I would never call them monsters.
Okay, everyone!
Time to show Equestria that you aren't monsters!
You're wonderful, mystical creatures!
Bye, friends.
Hopefully, we'll be able to turn you all back into your normal, wonderful selves soon.
What does that mean?
Oh, good.
We're all here.
As long as we all have each other, I'm sure we can do it!
It's okay.
You go ahead and Twilight, and we'll be here for you.
Discord when he was evil.
Shouldn't somepony tell Celestia and Luna?
What should we do to celebrate?
The Tree of Harmony can't really be gone, can it?
What do we do?
Or Angel...
or anypony forced to do that monster's bidding!
I've been known to get my hooves dirty!
I've never been so sad in my whole life!
[gasps]
For our friends!
Come on, everypony!
[shrieks]
Sombra's gonna force us to fight our way through our friends?
[pants]
Huh?
I don't know how long we can hold them off!
[gasps]
Thank you, Discord!
[gasps]
Discord!
[tearing up]
Oh, please wake up, please wake up...
[gasps]
Discord!
For our friends!
Aw, do you want more juice?
But he didn't, because he cares.
Every adventure is heart-pounding, but so rewarding.
If it means that much to you, Twilight, we're in.
Oh, no.
Well, I guess the opposite of what I'm good at is...
[gasps]
...being in small spaces.
It's almost too easy.
Uh, Pinkie?
We're not actually going into space, right?
We'll have to glide to the throne.
No flapping.
[gasps]
Oh, no!
Once, I got trapped in the Castle of the Two Sisters, and Angel Bunny and I were separated!
Now whenever I'm in a tiny room, it's all I can think about!
I was so worried he felt alone and forgotten!
What do you mean?
I know they both have a special place in their heart for you, but sibling dynamics are hard.
Trust me.
Honestly, he could learn a lot from you about being a little brother.
I don't think our plan is working.
You've been glaring so hard.
Who wants a feather massage?
I can't believe the ponies of Appleloosa built this place.
I'm so proud they decided to honor us.
I never thought I'd get to be in anything like a Hall of Fame.
I hope Snails finishes signing autographs soon.
We can't play without him.
And if we lose or forfeit one game, we'll be out of the tournament.
Oh, why?
And even though at first she thought you were the most annoying fanpony she ever met, you two eventually became friends.
Um...
Oh, no.
Quibble's wide open, and I'll never get there in time to block.
[gasps]
[gasps]
There are two traditional dances that everypony does at the Fete.
After a few days of practicing with us, you'll know them both.
Oh, [nervous laugh]
, I wouldn't say specialty.
It's just fun.
Here, Yona.
I made you a chart.
All you have to do is follow these dance steps.
You'll learn them in no time.
Now, just start walking.
Step on whatever color I name.
Let's begin.
[in rhythm with the music]
Blue, red, step ahead.
Green, black, now step back.
Now you try.
Good!
Now, [in rhythm]
black, green, red, and blue.
Red, black, hold one and two.
Red, blue, red once more.
Green, black, blue, red, three and four.
Ooh.
Um, maybe we should try this again later.
And are so well spoken!
[gasps]
We were so worried when you disappeared like that.
Oh, is everything all right, Smolder?
Baby...
dragon...
hatching season?
[gasps]
All those cute little snouts poking out of those adorable little shells?
Teeny, tiny, twitchy tails?
Can I go too?
Well, what would make your brother happy?
[sniffs]
Uh...
[through plugged nose]
That's an interesting smell.
Spike, do you mind if I take a peek at the cute little baby eggs?
Awww.
I'm sure he'll love it, Spike.
[gasps]
Oh...
my...
goodness!
Good morning, little one.
I've come a long way to meet you.
Did you know there's a whole wide world out here waiting to say hello?
Did you?
Oh, did you, boo?
[baby talk]
Ah, Dragon Lord Ember.
How nice to see you.
Fluttershy.
The one who loves creatures.
Are...
all these yours?
I think it sounds wonderful.
[gasps]
I'd love to!
Just tell me what to do!
Well, I'm sure you're doing great.
Oh, dear.
Maybe they're lonely?
Don't you worry.
Auntie Fluttershy's here.
And the Dragon Lord and I are gonna do everything we can to welcome you into this world.
Um...
I have no idea.
nd then they all lived happily ever after.
Time to come out, little ones.
[baby talk]
Maybe you'd like a song?
[deep breath]
I'm sorry.
[gasps]
Goodness.
Why are the eggs shaking?
[gasps]
Are they finally hatching?
[sighs]
Spike!
There you are!
For a land that's all rocks, this place is surprisingly easy to get lost in.
The eggs won't hatch.
They just keep shaking.
I'm starting to think the dragons are too scared to come out.
I was hoping you could help.
If you're not too busy cheering up Smolder's brother.
[gasps]
Excuse me, but that's not a very nice game!
ENOUGH!
[clears throat]
I mean, leave my friend alone please.
Spike came all this way to cheer up Garble, which was a very kind thing to do.
Just you wait, Garble.
You're dealing with Fluttershy now, and she's packin' a whole lifetime of kindness!
Garble!
Smolder!
Is anydragon there?
Oh, my.
Are those...
bongo drums?
[gasps]
Sneaking?
Looks to me like the only one sneaking around is you, Garble.
Why didn't you tell me you were a poet?
[gasps]
Words.
Rhythm.
Sometimes rhyme.
Weird punctu...
ation.
Sure sounds like poetry to me.
I totally feel you.
But why?
If I was a poet, I'd want to share my creations with everypony.
Is that why you pick on Spike?
To make your friends think you're tough?
Hmph!
I'll have you know Spike is stronger than you are any day!
[gasps]
First of all, there's nothing wrong with being a pony!
Second, Spike isn't afraid to be who he is, no matter what you or anycreature thinks!
That's real strength!
Not like some dragons I know.
Spike, look!
I'll take them all!
Oh, dear.
Tortoise-Snap said he was hungry.
But he promised me he would only take a few small bites.
Tortoise-Snap, I'm only asking nicely once!
Let my friend go!
Oh, my.
We'd better ask somepony to fix that hole.
It seems very dangerous.
It's not that we don't appreciate their help.
Um...
hmm.
Um, sorry for the bad news, but the courtyard is full of swans waiting to get in!
Tell the ponies at the gates there's a slight delay on the gala!
Oh, um, if it's not too much trouble, I mean.
Um...
a cupcake?
And Cheese Sandwich just left his own factory?
[gasps]
It's just...
Two weeks doesn't feel like a whole lot of time to train a whole team.
Um, [gasps]
what makes you so sure?
I guess that is sort of true.
Good work, everypony!
Let's take a break!
Thanks.
I'm excited to see what you've been up to.
Well, I'm sure you've put in a lot of hard work.
Ohhhh!
The suspense is horrible!
I'm the most nervous I've ever been, and that's saying something.
I sure hope Dash being nervous is a good sign.
Nice work, everyone.
You can't win them all.
I hope there's one on fur maintenance for adorable creatures, because I've been 'brushing up'.
[giggles]
Um, I'm just guessing, but is it zap apples?
[weak laugh]
[gasps]
Is the answer carrots?
We need to know what we're doing before we go and do it.
Take a breath.
Let it out slowly.
We're sure you're doing an excellent job.
Apparently, a lot can change in a minute.
What are we gonna do?
Oh, she would be so upset.
Discord is right.
Twilight needs us.
Whatever happened, we can fix this.
Rainbow Dash and the Wonderbolts will have all the weather rounded up any minute.
Oh, um, just a slight hiccup in the weather.
[laughs nervously]
We tried to fix it ourselves.
As your friends, we should've trusted you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Antoine believes what he eats is his business.
Do other predators feel that way, too?
Would anyprey like to respond?
Muriel, does it bother you when Antoine tries to eat you?
Just because you're on opposite ends of the food chain doesn't mean you can't work?
Huh?
It doesn't mean you can't...
It doesn't mean you can't work togeth?
[sighs]
I'm sorry, but the more you distract everyone, the longer this will take.
I am listening to you.
But if you really want to be heard, you should join our predator/prey support group.
Then you can talk to everyone here.
You could teach all these hungry predators the delights of a carrot-based cuisine.
Sorry, everyone.
I think somebunny just wants a little attention.
Now, since we all need to get along, what if all predators promise to only eat vegetables while staying at the sanctuary?
Oh, Sandra, you can do it.
[gasps]
Angel, Sandra, wait!
Ooh.
I certainly haven't.
That's a wonderful idea.
If we really want to know what's going on, we need to make sure the problem isn't your food.
I wouldn't worry too much.
It's probably just something he's been eating.
[grunts]
Um, is there anything else we can do for you?
You mean me and Angel?
Oh, he's fine!
We're fine!
I...
I just don't always have time to indulge him.
But we're best friends!
Okay, thanks!
But Angel and I are great!
Between here and teaching at the school, I'm not sure I do.
You're gonna love it here, little gecko.
What is it?
Not fluffy enough?
Oh, sorry.
We need to see if your food is causing your issue.
Huh?
Hmm.
Not now, Angel.
There's snake treats made to look like chocolate chip cookies.
They're vegan.
Pinkie Pie made a whole jar of them.
They're all yours if you promise.
No more trying to eat Muriel the baby elephant.
[gasps]
No, Angel.
I have too much to do.
Don't forget to shift your weight, Scout!
Her neck is feeling better, but a massage every day for the next week wouldn't hurt.
I'll add it to my list.
Angel!
Listen to you for once?
Just what exactly is that supposed to mean?
Come back!
I-I meant tell me, not?
[groans]
Unfortunately, that's not an option.
[groans]
I'll take care of it.
I hope this is important, Angel.
I barely made a dent in my to-do list for today.
Concentrated carrot extract?
That's for reviving energy-sapped herbivores.
Are you feeling rundown?
You just like the taste?
Ugh!
Angel, that extract is in short supply!
What's gotten into you?
Every day this week, you've been causing trouble when I have work to do!
Of course I know you can't talk to anypony else.
But that's not my fault.
I have responsibilities!
You're right.
We can't go on like this.
I guess we do need to see Zecora for help.
He's so impatient, even when he knows I have work to do.
Well, that's not true.
We talk all the time.
Of course talking at the sanctuary counts.
That's where I am when I don't have a class to teach.
What do you mean that's the problem?
You feel like I'm the only pony you can talk to, and all I do is ignore you?
Well, I feel like you don't care about my responsibilities.
[laughs nervously]
Um, as you can see, we're kind of at an impasse.
Is this what you meant by help us?
Not yet, Angel.
Zecora told us to take it together when we got home.
Hmm.
I suppose we could dust off the old picnic blanket.
It'll be just like old times.
We'll drink the potion and settle in for a nice tea party.
I can barely remember the last time we did that.
I've been so busy at the sanctuary.
Though I really need to keep an eye on Zecora's gecko, and I haven't finished any of today's chores.
If I don't, the animals won't get the care they need.
Ohh.
Maybe we should just save the potion until af?
Angel!
Zecora said to go home first!
I know she said we have to take it together, so...
I guess I have to.
[gulping, belches]
I wonder what it's gonna doooo?
[high-pitched scream]
Oh, my goodness!
I'm back!
I'm a pony again!
Oh, Angel.
I promise to always make time for you from now on.
What do you mean maybe I won't have to?
You want to do what?
And that's when I realized Fluttershy doesn't have to be the only one I talk to.
I can come here and talk to all of you.
And now that I know how much work goes into this place, I suppose I can kinda sorta help out every now and then.
Oh, Angel.
That is so sweet.
But now that I know what you go through every day, I understand why your time with me is so important.
I promise to always make time for you.
Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you.
I just stopped by to thank you for letting me borrow your Daring Do books.
I love them!
This is actually my second time through!
I read them all!
From Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue to Daring Do and the Fallen Idol!
It just came out last week.
Maybe that's why you haven't heard of it?
Well, I'm happy to let you borrow mine until yours arrives.
It looks like she didn't.
This book says it's by Groom Q.
Martingale.
I guess he's a new writer.
It was written from his point of view.
I figured it was an artistic choice.
Sorry.
Don't you think you should read Martingale's book first?
Just to hear both sides of the story?
There's also a lot of insight into Dr.
Caballeron's life choices.
Did you know he's actually a history professor and amateur bird watcher?
[whispers]
Also spider cruelty.
You have to admit Daring Do wrecks a lot of spider webs in her adventures.
I'm not sure those are all fans.
But why?
Aren't you proud of your adventures?
Maybe we can ask him.
Oops.
Um, sorry.
E-Excuse us.
Uh, A.
Yearling?
Would you sign our book?
Fluttershy.
With two T's.
It's true.
They are.
Is something wrong?
Want to talk about what happened?
Daring Do did have a lot of artifacts on her shelves at home.
But didn't you try to sell them to the highest bidder?
She does destroy a lot of ancient sites.
Not to mention the homes of the animals that live there.
Fluttershy.
Two T's.
Who, me?
I decided to find out which author is really telling the truth, so I joined Dr.
C's Tenochtitlan expedition!
Oh, that's so thoughtful.
Thank you.
I can help with that!
Here!
Of course!
That's part of the fun of having an adventure with friends!
That's a common misconception.
Have you ever tried just talking to them?
We're very sorry for coming into your territory.
We're just passing through.
Everycreature likes to be listened to.
You just need to take the time to understand them.
Thanks.
I'm having the best time with you all!
Well, keep trying.
I believe in you.
Withers.
Don't.
Move.
Don't be upset.
I can get it.
I want to do it!
For all of you, my new friends.
And to protect a historical treasure!
Whoa!
Aah!
Thanks, everypony.
Wait!
You don't understand!
My friends are researchers!
They only want to study the Talisman and keep it safe in a museum!
Right, Dr.
[gasps]
But...
But you said?
Um, excuse me?
Uh, guardian-goyles?
There's none of that in here.
Wow!
You two make a great team!
See?
Told you he'd listen.
[gasps]
I think our problem is the solution.
But why?
Nopony ever asked Ahuizotl what his side of the story is.
He must have a reason for being so upset.
Understanding begins with listening.
Um, not really.
Just here to ask ?
why are you chasing us, Mr Ahuizotl?
Awww.
That sounds like a lot of responsibility.
It doesn't always mean they're telling the truth, but everycreature deserves kindness.
I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.
Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you.
None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.
That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try.
I hope you're right about the girls coming here.
Or maybe, since we told them they were too young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic!
Goodness!
A Whirling Mungtooth!
They are very rare and just the cutest little things when they're not excited.
This one's excited.
When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker.
They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning.
I'll show you.
He mostly just needs to see you.
After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.
Maybe they keep their produce in the back?
Um, no, thank you.
We'll keep looking.
But I'm sure it's not because they're worried about you.
Discord, how could you do this to Twilight?
And us?
Fly, my pretties!
It's our only chance!
This is really bad.
Don't!
That's exactly what Chrysalis and the others want.
More fighting.
We know you're scared.
We're here to help.
I probably know more about being scared than anypony.
But thanks to all of you, I've learned I'm always less scared when I'm with my friends.
Discord's magic is so chaotic, he's the only one who can use it.
It's like the end of an era.
Wonderful work, everyone!
We couldn't be more ready.
Josephine, if you and the rest of the doves leave now, we should all arrive in Canterlot at the same time.
Eloise and Hubert, you should go, too.
I know it's a long way, but don't worry.
I'll bring plenty of snacks to restore your energy before we perform.
Everyone else gets to ride since the trip's too much for your little wings.
We need everyone in tip-top shape for the coronation.
I'm glad we got the chance for one last rehearsal.
Everyone's so excited.
But I can't imagine anypony's more excited than you.
Moving to Canterlot.
Being crowned.
I can't think of a single bad thing about any of it!
And I still need to pick up food for the swans and doves who flew ahead to Canterlot.
If I don't get them fed, they'll be too pooped to perform.
I can't believe you'd think we don't.
I was just trying to make you feel better.
That way I wouldn't feel so terrible.
I'm scared, too.
What if we don't talk as much?
[sighs]
I don't have the snacks the doves and swans will need to perform after their long flight.
I'd better find the food car.
Oh, dear.
I know these aren't the snacks I promised, but it's all I could find.
No matter how much things change, you'll always have this to look back on.
I'm there almost every day.
Who was that?
Oh, I'm really sorry.
I-I just found it, and-and I thought I should give it to her.
I didn't know you had dropped it.
It... doesn't really belong to you, either.
N-n-nothing...
I can't believe you did that!
Well, it's just that nobody ever stands up to Sunset Shimmer.
You've heard of her?
I don't think I've seen you around before.
Did you just transfer to Canterlot High from another school?
I'm...
Fluttershy.
It's Fluttershy!
Oh, my goodness!
Who's this sweet little guy?
Oh, he's so cute!
Go on, eat up, little pup!
Oh, wouldn't ya just give anything to know what they're really thinking?
Oh, w-what do you mean?
How did you know?
Mm-mm.
Mm-hmm.
This morning, I was passing out flyers for the animal shelter like I do every Wednesday.
Canterlot's animal shelter needs more volunteers.
Won't you help an animal that can't help itself?
[whimpers]
I have no idea how it got there.
But I didn't want anything to happen to it, so I decided to give it to Principal Celestia.
You could say that.
Technically, I guess she and Vice Principal Luna do make the rules.
Probably in her office.
Third door on your left.
Oh, wait!
You're not really supposed to have pets on school grounds.
Might wanna tuck him into your backpack.
That's what I do.
They just get so lonely when I'm in school all day.
Oh, no!
I'm late for class!
Of course!
[gasp]
Oh, gosh!
Sorry.
It's just, oh, running for Fall Formal Princess is a really bad idea.
Sunset Shimmer wants to be Fall Formal Princess, and when she wants something, she gets it!
She'll make life awful for anyone who stands in her way.
Just ask the girl who ran against her for Princess of the Spring Fling.
Oh, I don't think you understand.
You'd have to convince everyone here to vote for you instead of her: the athletes, the fashionistas, the dramas, the eco-kids, the techies, the rockers...
Maybe it was different at your old school, but at CHS, everybody sticks to their own kind.
One thing that they do have in common is that they know Sunset Shimmer is gonna rule the school until we graduate.
Me too.
Oh, she hasn't seen it yet.
Not that it'll make any difference, but I'll still vote for you.
You were so nice to stand up for me when Sunset Shimmer was picking on me yesterday.
Word of advice?
Don't accept her help.
She doesn't take anything seriously!
She's right.
Sunset Shimmer isn't the one who ruined my silent auction for the animal shelter by bringing fireworks and noisemakers!
It was supposed to be a serious event, and Pinkie Pie ruined it!
I never sent you a text!
Flash Sentry broke up with her a few weeks ago.
I can't believe she hasn't done something awful to him yet.
This is so amazing!
Tell me, what are you thinking right now?
You're from another world?
[whispers]
Yaaay!
I still can't believe we pulled that off!
Twilight!
Where did you stay?
Thanks for coming, Rarity.
The rescue center needs all the help it can get.
Once a year, a lucky volunteer gets to clean the hamster habitat.
I signed up for it months ago to be sure I'd get it.
[singsongy]
Housecleaning!
They sure are.
But they're cute and cuddly like bunnies.
Okay, everyhamster, follow Rarity into the next room.
She'll take good care of you while I give your home a nice scrub.
Rarity, what happened?
Ladies and gentlehamsters, please!
Now, I know you're all upset, but why don't we head back into the habitat and talk it over?
[exclaims]
Oh, my goodness!
It does?
[sniff, sniff]
Did I get it?
You were pretty bad at the Fall Formal.
Um, Rainbow Dash?
I was wondering if we could maybe play the song I wrote?
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's probably not it.
I can't believe they got to Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna too.
But that was when Twilight was here.
There may be some kind of magic inside us, but it only comes out when we play music.
I sure don't know how to use it to...
whoop anybody's butt.
What is it, Twilight?
I don't think I like this story very much.
Oh, I'm pretty sure I could find something to worry about.
But it won't be the sirens.
You mean like a song?
Thanks.
[sighs]
Hopefully one day, we'll get a chance to play it.
I'm trying.
It was pretty distracting...
Um, I was just wondering.
We haven't played any of my songs yet, and...
Don't know why I even asked...
[squeals]
Who are you kidding?
You know it isn't gonna be us.
This doesn't make any sense.
We were awful.
Doesn't anybody else think it's strange that we're the ones that made it to the finals?
I write songs!
You just never let us play any of them!
[squee]
Um, are you sure we need to figure it out?
And I was just about to tuck everyone in for the night at the shelter.
Now we'll have to start stories all over again.
Do you think she came through the portal from Equestria?
[shudders]
I don't even wanna guess.
We'll be fighting against a school full of meanies.
Not everything has to be magical to be important.
Rainbow Dash, that was amazing!
Even I feel like we can win!
It could be anything.
Your uniform for what?
Our Twilight wouldn't.
Oh, Sunset, I'm sure you'll be able to figure things out.
That's not a very nice thing to say.
They definitely broke the ice.
Do you wanna give her a treat?
[giggles]
Not just one.
It really is uncanny.
Does he talk?
Congratulations on winning, by the way.
Though, it didn't seem like anyone on your team was very excited about it.
That sounds awful.
Here.
Hold this.
Holding a bunny always makes me feel better.
You looked like you needed it.
[shudders]
[sighs]
Bye.
All I did was hand Twilight a bunny.
Then I ponied up.
And then Twilight's pendant thingy just pulled the magic right out of me.
I couldn't even stand up.
How?
I'm sure glad I don't go to Crystal Prep.
I don't feel like playing these games anymore.
Especially since she obviously didn't mean to do all the stuff she did.
She's actually really nice.
Still no word from Princess Twilight?
Um, Twilight?
Isn't Camp Everfree just beautiful?
I can't wait until we have our first nature walk.
You wanna see all the adorable woodland creatures, too?
Early morning nature walks?
I got Amethyst.
It is lovely out here.
The fresh air, the cool breeze, the birds that land on your finger.
Aren't they just the cutest?
And little boxes with food so you can feed the ducks and fishies.
[gasps]
Oh, dear.
Sorry, Spike.
I guess that story got to me.
At least the fishies are eating well.
I don't know.
We were just decorating cookies and?
Oh, dear.
We really should clean all of this up.
[struggles]
Can someone help me out?
Thank you, Mr Bird.
Why, of course I can get you a little something to?
[gasps]
Did you just...
talk?
But I don't speak chirp.
I don't know if you're the only bird I can understand.
Oh, no!
Please don't call for your friends.
It's nice to meet all of you, too.
Um, yes?
[screams]
Um, Gaea Everfree?
[screams]
I didn't scream.
Oh, none of us do.
Oh, why do these kinds of things always happen to us?
Um, hi.
Do you think you can give us a hand?
um, er, paw?
We could really use a way out.
I could help write a new song just for the occasion!
You're not gonna ask us to give them up, are you?
I know.
It's just that...
um...
uh, I-I don't think I can do one of those.
Oh, no!
What happened?
Are you okay?
We can start by teaching you the words to our song.
Yet.
Wanna help me make some changes?
And ask her to sign my petition to bring more bird feeders to Canterlot High!
Well, Chestnut Magnifico is an avid supporter of a foundation that helps build homes for animals in need.
Maybe we shouldn't bother her when she's in her trailer.
[gasps]
[gasps]
Oh, dear!
You don't think...
When Rarity and I followed Chestnut Magnifico to her trailer, we overheard her saying something about shutting down the movie...
Hello?
Rainbow Dash?
Are you in there?
It's okay, Dashie.
We're here.
Um, who's SunShim?
Ooh, like...
like what things?
You work here?
I think I might be freaking out a little bit.
It's sort of a deep-down-inside freakout.
Um, girls...
Um, girls...
Girls...
Um, so sorry to interrupt, but?
[sighs]
That's what I was trying to say.
[whimpers]
Um, some light blush could be nice.
Um, I'm glad to help, but I'm not sure my voice will add much...
oomph?
Wow.
Um, [clears throat]
gooooooooooo.
Colts.
Colts.
Goal.
Goooooooooooooooooal.
Song?
Sooooooonnnng?
Hands.
Are you, um, sure about this one?
Yay.
Yay.
[sighs]
[giggles]
Who's a good girl?
Almost done, Winona!
Now she's all ready for the photo shoot.
For the charity calendar.
We're making it to raise money for the local animal shelter.
It's gonna feature all of our pets.
[gasps]
Do you want one?
[giggles]
Okay, everypet, get ready for your big close-up.
[gasps]
I thought you'd never ask!
Welcome to the animal shelter!
Oh, I just know there's gonna be the perfect little pet for you somewhere in here!
They're just so cuddly.
Don't you think, Sunset Shimmer?
How about a betta fish?
No fur at all.
And this one's got beautiful fins.
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, I know just the thing!
[sniffles]
[giggles]
Oh, don't worry.
You can scoot in a little, sweetie.
They won't bite.
[giggles]
[gasps]
Oh, no!
[squeals]
The revenge?
[whimpers]
Oh, that all sounds lovely!
You're sure it isn't too much for one hang-out?
I got something special for your big night.
Just in case.
Well, hello there, Hubert.
Is everything okay?
We'll talk after the quiz, okay?
Slow down.
You're all talking at once.
What is it?
Oh, I see.
If you take four from that one and divide them equally, that sounds like a solution to the problem, Reginald.
Good thinking.
I swear I wasn't cheating.
I was whispering to the birds because they were having an argument over sticks for their nests and?
No, n-n-no!
See, Hubert thought that Reginald was stealing from his, but I told him, Surely, you can tell the difference between oak and poplar sticks.
Right, sweetie?
[giggles]
They don't know anything about math, but I studied really hard for this test.
Hey!
I know my stuff!
Go on.
Make...
my...
day!
[giggles]
Oh, um, excuse me, but, um, can we please have the jewelry back now?
Um, excuse us, sorry to interrupt your lunch, but, do you mind?
[gasps]
I don't think so.
I hear crying.
From a bunch of baby sea turtles.
They just hatched and are trying to find their way to the water.
But they're lost.
Ohhh...
How could I ever find a bunch of teeny, tiny turtles on this great, big beach?
Hmmm...
That's not exactly the same, but it's worth a try.
Lead the way, Tank!
You did it, Tank!
We just need to help them get to the water safely.
Just over this sand dune, past those rocks and crabs, beyond that abandoned sandcastle city, and around that dangerous shipwreck!
[gasps]
Oh, boy...
We can't!
They have to make the journey on their own so they can imprint and return to this beach when they lay their own eggs someday.
That's it.
The path is clear.
Go, baby turtles!
Be free!
Um...
Adorable tiny turtles?
Tank led the babies!
Well done, Tank!
They think Tank's their mommy.
Thanks for helping with the Crab Adopt-a-Thon, everyone.
They're hot, poor things.
If only we had a way to cool them off.
But I don't hear anything.
I'll go.
Maybe I can hear it better underwater.
[sputters]
I think I caught our monster.
Oh, no-no-no-no.
I'll leave that to the experts like you and Rai?
My brother?
No, you haven't.
You only just?
Okay.
All set up to make the cutest, most cuddly adoption video ever.
Once everyone sees what good pets you are, you'll find your forever homes in no time.
[deep breath]
I know exactly what to say.
I just have to say it to the camera nice and clear.
Yup.
Just me, Pup-Pup, and the camera.
[gulps]
Plus the hundreds of people who'll watch the video...
[whimpers]
Are you an animal looking for a home?
Whoops.
Oh, I mean...
Take two!
Is your home furry?
No, no, no, start over.
Take three.
Pets... Friend... You... Happy... Take...
T-T-Take, take, take...
Oh... Maybe I'll take an entirely different approach off-camera.
You guys should be the stars of the video anyhow.
I'll just get some super-cute shots of you guys being your well-behaved, perfect pet selves.
And action!
That's it, Mr Puppy!
Oh, where did Kitty run off to?
Come down and play.
Please?
Okay.
They heard the call of the wild...
There's no way I'm gonna finish this video.
[gasps]
You do?
Shelter pets... are the best!
If you're looking for a pet, these pets are looking for you!
Come on down to the Canterlot Animal Shelter!
Where we have the furry friend that's purr-fect for you!
Oh, no, Sunset.
I can't.
The thought of singing in public makes me...
[squeaks]
[squeaky]
I guess so.
They're starting to head north for the winter.
[shudders]
Yay, games.
The squirrel one.
Time to press some buttons.
Whee.
Like this?
Hmm?
Ooh.
Yippee!
Did I do it right?
Sure is, Applejack.
Can't wait to see all the wonderful contestants.
Mm-hmm.
Fresh and spiffy.
Banana!
Anything else to share?
[giggles]
Banana's favorite snack is bananas, he loves his banana toy, and his favorite pastime is?
Awww!
What a cutie!
Oh, really?
She loves daytime TV, is a great listener, and?
I think we have time for one more quick interview.
Awwww.
[giggles]
Winona only said that she wanted to surprise you by competing today!
That's the signal!
It's time to enjoy the cutest show in Canterlot!
I have such a hard time reading that Gummy.
He's a pet of mystery.
Thank you, Applejack!
JVJ-24601 really wowed the judges with their super shiny coat.
Couldn't agree more, Applejack!
And Tank kept his focus, despite the distraction of being totally in love.
Bravo, Tank!
Well, Tank is a very talkative tortoise.
Yes, despite being in a horribly cranky mood during the personality round, Fluffersnuff really turned on the charm for the win!
You guys did great!
Um, isn't Rarity in this class?
I only signed up for drama to be with Rarity, but she wasn't there.
Which was very dramatic, but for all the wrong reasons.
Um, has anyone seen Sunset?
If you're missing your friends, try Flora/Fauna.
[giggles]
Fish Eye!
Bigfoot Blurry in the Background!
Looks just like him.
That cake looks delicious.
If you've got hang-ups with hangers, look for style right outside your window.
Well, actually, they do want me to regurgitate worms into their beaks.
Whoa!
[grunts]
I'm Fluttershy, trying out for Coal Miner #2.
Ahem.
Down here, we mine for coal.
Ohhh...
It would be so fun to be in the play with all of you.
But when I think about trying out on stage all alone...
Mm-mm.
Well, it's different when we're all together.
It's less...
terrifying.
Really?
Hmm...
Who should I pick to help me?
Mm-mm.
[distressed squeal]
[taps microphone]
[over loudspeaker]
Here goes.
Um, in between two with the...
score time...
[over loudspeaker]
She's bringing, um...
Oh, help me, somebody.
The...
ball goes up, and...
boom goes a header ball?
a-a head ball.
Uh...
Oh, no.
Number twenty-two is pushing to the... limit.
The ball, it's tucked away by number thirty-four, who passes back to Dash.
She holds it, makes her move.
She's coming, hears the crowd, she's wide open!
I don't believe it!
Down here, we mine for...
cooooooaaaaaaaal!
Chickens?
Mm-mm.
Even you?
I'm Fluttershy, trying out for Coal Miner #2.
Down here, we mine for coal.
Actually, I pictured everyone in the audience as you, Applejack.
Down here, we mine for coal.
I could help.
I'd start with...
a bird.
Then iguana, guinea pig, regular pig, frog, baby chick in the egg, baby chick out of the egg, all three see-no-evil monkeys, cat, cat, cat, cat, all the cats, and, um...
...finish it with a squirrel on his hind legs.
A bunch of cute animal emojis!
[giggles]
No matter what the problem is, adorable animals are always the answer.
Let one of us help take your mind off it.
Ta-da!
Just what you needed.
An escape to nature.
Oh, dear.
I got mud on my boots.
Oh, no-no-no.
Don't think about that.
Think about... this.
Be as cute as you can possibly be.
It's why I love nature so much more than big cities.
Aah!
Animals, unite!
Dazzle her with your tranquility.
Shhh.
Let her take a little nap, everyone.
All we need now is some volunteers to keep her warm.
Spunky and Plunky, are you up to the task?
What do you mean you failed?
We could use my car.
Sunset, over here!
In you go, Miss Kitty.
It's the driving safety rhyme.
Start your trip with seat belt time.
Nine and three is where you'll be.
Adjust your mirror to see things clearer.
Check your little engine light to make sure that the trip's all right.
The coolest drivers will admire?
...properly inflated tires.
Funny you should ask.
I actually have a rhyme for that, too.
Thinking of calling in sick?
The mine is closed.
[whimpers]
The mine is closed!
The mine is closed!
This isn't in the script!
It is?
The mine is closed!

[breathes deeply]
[whimpers]
The mine is closed!
The mine is closed!
This isn't in the script!
It is?
The mine is closed!
We do?
Who?
Don't worry, Twilight.
We know you're a genius.
Yech.
Quincy the sea turtle says the tide's coming in.
We should take the picture soon or risk having damp ankles.
Oh, he's so thoughtful.
And it's not funny!
Why is she still talking to us?
And it wasn't very nice to the ducks, either.
Hmm.
That's what I'm afraid of.
[squeals]
[squeals]
...we'd be proud to call you...
She posts a lot of pictures of her Welsh corgi named Yas Queen.
Um, how many people will be watching us?
Should we practice for the parade?
It's a little...
[gasps]
...daunting, isn't it?
[shudders]
What?
I can't hear you over all the screaming!
I wish I'd gone with Sunset and Twilight.
Or Pinkie Pie.
Or anyone else in the entire park.
Can't I conquer something a little smaller first?
Mm-mm.
Oh, these kids are so brave.
That was actually kind of... fun.
[giggles]
You were very brave.
[giggles]
Hmmm...
I don't understand.
You want me to pretend I'm someone else tonight?
Uh, maybe I, um...
shouldn't do it.
At all.
You did?
Um, excuse me?
Vignette?
Where am I?
Ooh!
And do you mind if I eat this salad?
I'm feeling stressed.
They have to stop fighting first.
Oh, I hope Rarity and Applejack are okay.
I wish we knew what's going on out there.
What happens if she decides she doesn't like the crowd?
I should ask you the same thing.
Ooh!
Sounds...
luxurious.
Is the sea monster okay in the story?
A goat on a boat?
[laughs]
Now I've seen everything.
Aren't you just the softest thing?
You have forty-two grandchildren?
Wow, Mr Bouncy, that is impressive!
I'd love to meet them.
Whoa!
Um...
eat carrots?
She also scared the animals in the petting zoo.
Now they don't want pets.
It's just a zoo.
Oh, of course.
I don't think that's a thing.
Is that how romance sounds?
What happened to the lights?
[giggles]
And I'll make sure there's lifejackets for everyone.
Even grandchildren.
Oh, I hope they hurry back!
When?
[groans]
I can't take much more of this!
[gasps]
We're...
sinking!
We're sinking!
I'll get the animals!
[whimpers]
[giggles]
So...
now what?
[spit take, laughs]
Sorry.
That one has animals in it.
Um, I don't get it.
[spit take, laughs]
Sorry.
That one has animals in it.
[spit take, laughs]
But weren't you supposed to see PostCrush togeter?
He's terrible.
[laughs]
Sorry.
[spit take, laughs]
Ohhhh.
[laughs]
Puns.
Hoo.
I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie!
Whoa!
That means we'll have to...
leave Equestria.
Yay.
Oh...
Ooh!
Oh, my!
[squeaks]
[sobs]
Oh my goodness!
[shivers]
[yells]
I can't look!
Ooh!
A g-g-g-g-ghost town?
[gasps]
Then [pants]
who did?
Ooh!
[laughs]
Wow!
[giggles]
Yay.
Aw, so cute!
[whimpers]
[sighs]
This whole journey was such a mistake.
[gasps]
All we wanted was somepony to help us.
How?
We'll never catch up!
[sighs]
[whimpers]
Ooh!
You seem tense.
Do you wanna talk about it?
Let it all out.
Sorry, our time is up.
Buh-bye!
Now what?
What's a Hearthswarming Helper?
Will that help, Twilight?
Oh, this is so exciting!
Ooh.
I couldn't pick just one.
What if it hurt the other foods' feelings?
I really, really like...
everything!
Why do you ask?
Hmmm...
Not liking things!
I hope that helped!
Mm-hmm.
She loves shiny things.
Oh, no.
Maybe I could help.
Unless you don't want to?
I was just talking to Rainbow Dash about these?
Wait.
Trade?
Do you want to trade names, too?
Phew!
I come to the Rainbow Falls Hearth's Warming Craft Fair every year.
They have perfect presents for anypony.
Sure.
Limited number of what?
I am!
She certainly wouldn't wanna miss out on that.
That sounds just like her!
Ooh!
Ooh!
How much does it cost?
Holly the Hearth's Warmer doll.
Isn't she sweet?
It's the must-have gift of the season.
And in short supply.
All my bits.
All my bits?
Can I borrow some for the train ride home?
Well, that sounds fu?
Oh, that's true.
I do.
Woo-hoo?
Oh, right.
They really are good at selling things.
Of course Rainbow Dash wouldn't want this!
I'm so mad, I could just...
kick!
[pained noise]
But Flim and Flam have a point.
We can't tell ponies what to buy.
But, Applejack, your granny, your brother, and your sister, they are all so different.
How can the same doll be the right gift for all of them?
Just because it's must-have for one pony doesn't mean it's must-have for everypony, does it?
Ooh.
But we never got gifts for Spike or Rainbow Dash, and it's already Hearth's Warming Eve.
Don't do that.
How did everypony's shopping go?
Oh, my.
Uh...
[clears throat]
Excuse me.
Whoa!
This is supposed to be the happiest time of year!
So if this is how you plan on behaving, you can march yourself right back to where you came from!
Awww.
Your family is gone for the holidays, and you're all alone?
I'm so sorry.
If you calm down, I'm sure you could join us.
[giggles]
We're really sorry about your gifts.
Oh, he's a big sweetheart.
And he ended up being really helpful.
It was actually kind of nice to be the pony who saved the day for once.
Did Pinkie Pie say what her Hearth's Warming Eve surprise was going to be?
What kind of something?
[cries]
I'm gonna ask them politely!
I've been trying to teach my students how to feed a hedgehog?
But that keeps happening.
Two...
S-So... c-c-c-c-c-cold...
I don't know.
Not even I speak sound effect.
Oh, um...
sixteen, actually.
[giggles]
Well, um, I'm not exactly sure.
All right, class.
Time to tidy up.
I mean, it's time for a clean-up dance party!
Today, we're gonna learn about responsibility.
By taking care of baby animals!
Sorry, everyone.
Looks like we have to cancel our field trip because of the weather.
We'll just have to stay here and play games instead!
I definitely think they should be Teachers of the Month, don't you?
Don't worry.
We wouldn't have left without you.
Has anypony seen Twilight?
It's not like her to be late for an adventure.
Um, why aren't we going anywhere?
Oh, look.
There's a famous butterfly garden, too.
Ooh, it's getting darker by the minute.
Oh, no!
Where...
are we?
Rainbow Dash, did your letter say where our hotel is?
Oh, look.
There's somepony.
Huh?
And look.
It comes with a cute little spider.
Hello, spider.
Awww.
Why is everypony looking at us?
Oh, my.
I knew something was different, but?
Maybe they don't even notice.
It might be rude to mention it.
We're very sorry about your rainbow billboard, Mr Mayor.
It was dark and?
Huh?
And...
the butterfly garden?
So none of the butterflies are actually...
How...
multitalented of him.
Maybe we should let the mayor explain.
Um...
I'd better go with her.
More?
[gasps]
It looks like it's closed.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
If you don't mind my asking, you don't sound like the other ponies here in town.
What happened?
What about that tree?
Its apricots are big and juicy.
W-What was that?
Have you tried saying hello to him?
Moody Root, are you there?
I'm Fluttershy.
Your apricot tree is beautiful.
So healthy.
You must take very good care of it.
I bet that's why you have so many of them.
You must always be busy making things.
Jam, cobbler, pie...
Your neighbors were just about to bake some pies.
You know them, right?
...and Mrs Hoofington, Mr Moody Root.
But they're a little short on apricots.
Then everypony can share.
What do you think, Mr Moody Root?
Wait for it...
Uh-huh.
Courtesy of the Hoofingtons.
Ooh.
What's happening?
[giggles]
And it looks like there's a butterfly garden after all.
