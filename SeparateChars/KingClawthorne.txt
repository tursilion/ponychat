Who dares intrude upon I, the king of demons?
I don't know who your little guy is!
Eda, who is this monster?
Hooray!
Please don't encourage her!
Nyeh!
Soon, Mr Ducky, we shall drink the fear of those who mocked us.
Try to catch me when I'm covered in grease.
I'm a squirmy little fella.
Aah!
You and I will sneak up to the top of the tower, where they're holding my crown.
It's hideous.
Ha-ha!
Cat's don't do that.
Not yet, you're not.
My crown!
It's close!
I can sense its power!
Oh, yeah.
My crown!
Yes. Yes! I can feel my powers returning!
I shall call you Francois, and you shall be a minion in my army of darkness.
Ha-ha!
Weh?
My power!
Ow, my bones!
If you think this guy is bad, you shoulda seen her last boyfriend!
That was actually one of her better breakups.
This shall suffice.
You there, plant!
You are now under my command.
Let her stay!
She can make us snacks.
Too tight!
Too tight!
Your sleep cocoon looks fluffy.
Hey!
Less ready, more scratchy!
Nyah!
Is it my birthday?
Ooo, gimme gimme gimme!
Yes!
Another worthy addition to my army of terror!
Truly horrifying!
Yeah!
This bear could be our new Luz.
You're unbearable!
Did someone say boot camp?
I agree to run it.
We'll rise at dawn!
You'll carry me on your back as I yell hateful things about your performance!
I am not adorable!
This is ludicrous!
I once led armies.
I can lead a dang boot camp!
But I have no recruits.
Or do I?
Ugh, no!
You are too desperate!
Role call!
Oh, you're perfect already!
As for the rest of you, I'm only saying this once so listen up!
Huh it's no fun if they don't tremble.
Ohh okay, alright.
Yep, an idea is happening!
Military discipline, cooking!
Ha, I truly am a demon for all seasons!
Just a dash of Eda's secret sauce and I'm the creator of life!
Yes, yes, yes!
My loyal recruits!
Welcome to boot camp!
You sure need it.
Look at you: raggedy, pathetic, chewed on, you got a button hangin' off of your eye.
Pathetic!
But I'll mold you worms into... slightly... better kinds of worms.
Your first mission: gimme snacks!
Your commander is hungry, so pick it up!
Hey, Private Dingdong, snacks are that-a-way!
You better shape up recruit, you're in my boot camp now.
Yep, keep 'em coming.
And don't forget the pretzels this time.
Running a boot camp is tough work, but as my second-in-command, you deserve this.
Hey, hey!
You're not privy to snacking privileges, back away!
Leading this boot camp has tuckered a little guy out, so Sergeant King signing off.
Excuse me?
Could you maybe turn down those eyeballs?
Trying to sleep.
Hey!
How dare you mutiny!
Unhand your commander right now!
I gave you life, I can take it away!
Hooty, Hooty!
Great news, buddy, you can be in the boot camp!
First task: destroy the boot camp.
What?
But you begged to join!
Ugh!
What do you want?
This day shall live in infamy.
Private Hooty, today when the felt flew you showed grit and determination that were instrumental in securing our victory.
May I just say, it has been an honor, to be your commander.
Private, our hearts have been touched by fire, and... Um, excuse me? We're having a moment here!
Ugh, moment ruined.
Weh?
King demands huggies too!
Cape? I thought you were making cake!
I, uh... anyway!
If there's no cake, then I have to get to work!
Would you look at us two, being all generous to that kid.
You know what, when she first got here, I thought we were gonna eat her.
But now I only think of that, like, sometimes.
Wait!
Wait for me!
You're not the only one who knows dark magic!
Now stop gawking and load me in!
Gentle!
The cake is me!
Hey, um, where's Eda?
Show me the picture.
Show me the picture!
Hah!
I can draw better than that.
You know, they once called me the King of Artists.
Doesn't matter.
What's important is that my followers would leave me offerings in fear of me!
Weh?
Destiny?
Feh!
Are you bestowing gifts upon me?
Yes! I accept your offering!
The King of Demons is back!
Cupcakes in my tummy-tum makes the King say yummy-yum!
Hmm... Nope!
Oh, hey, Luz!
Wah!
I'm not a pet!
Good night, sweet child.
Do it, Luz!
For my honor!
Mmm?
Oh, yeah.
Things that are free?
People are giving offerings to me!
I love offerings!
What did I miss?
Weh?
This I gotta see!
Hey!
You root for Luz or nobody!
Mmm?
I'm okay!
Luz! Help me!
My offerings!
Hey, wait for me!
Luz! You left me!
Nah.
That stuff just weighed me down.
But I have something for you, Luz.
And it's the best thing, because it's free, comes from my heart, and I always have more than I need.
Ugh!
Tote bags!
And they have so many uses! 
Away, fair chariot! Away!
You very much don't!
You think that's impressive?
Check this out!
Two warriors battling to the death!
Senseless violence.
Yes, attack!
Death is your god!
Hah!
What possible regrets could come from the internet?
Did you know that the Earth is actually flat?
Ah, a severed hand!
Perfect response.
Nah, she'd be freaked out by our world anyway.
So actually, by keeping the truth from her, you're doing her a favor!
Always trust a shoulder demon!
I forge my own path!
What a dum-dum.
Ugh.
Who has the energy?
Why am I doing this?
I don't even wear clothes!
And Gus asked me to co-emcee the fight!
We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath!
A great joke, Luz!
Uh, maybe you were too hard on her.
She's saved you from multiple monsters, remember?
Girl, you can pull off anything!
Up top!
We're style geniuses!
Why so twitchy, witchy?
Trying to remember if I've ever seen you this nervous before.
Wow, Gus is really good at this.
They're hanging on his every word!
Whoo, I, uh, hope my material's up to snuff.
Whoah!
What do you think will go better with the youths, close-up magic or impressions?
Aaahh!
Hel-LO, Hexside!
Oh, oh gosh.
Um... whoooo.
Wow, these lights are warm.
Observe!
Luz, is um... she's down there, all right.
And, uh, yes she is!
There she goes!
You will clap for me!
Please?
Nothing!
Leave me be!
Well if that's the rule...
Oh, how can this be?
I get stage fright!
The king of demons!
I know, I know.
Imagine everyone in their underwear.
I dunno.
I always do that.
I am a little weirdo.
Gimme!
King of Demons, you got this.
Well, folks, looks like our show literally just took off!
Weh?
Uh, took off just like your local sports team would take off when they're about to make a goal?
Yeah, that's right, so let's follow them and see what happens next.
And there you have it, folks.
A happy ending for this year's Grom.
Let's give a big hand to our Grom queens, Luz and Amity!
Of course I did it!
I'm the King of Demons and I've never had stage fright in my life!
They love me!
Now I am King and Queen!
Best of both things!
Your curse is returning!
I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down!
I know the pain.
Yeah, busy playing Hexes Hold'em.
She's obsessed with it.
You're playing it right now!
Like me!
Whoa!
Jelly beans!
He wants to be called that.
Really?
Now?
Oof.
That was painful to watch.
I don't look good in clothes.
I'm all-natural.
Eda, do something!
King?
Who's King?
I go by Little Bone Boy now.
You promise?
Okay, okay.
I'll grab you the elixir and then we can bust out of here.
Heh?
Just because I have a model's body doesn't mean you can use me like this.
Eda, quick!
I can't believe they animated a whole house.
Aw, come on, Luz.
It's not every day you get to go to the dump and pick apart a garbage carcass.
Lose apprentice, gain garbage eggs.
Fair trade.
If you don't teach Luz right, you will.
And that's when I come in, make her my apprentice.
Hey, that only happened once!
I'd teach her about demons.
How to identify them, talk to 'em, raise an army with them and tear apart the world!
You think you're so smart!
Well, why don't we make a little bet where I can prove that I'd make a better teacher.
I like those odds.
Well, when you lose, you'll have to... wear a shame hat and sleep in a shack and never come into the Owl House again!
Who's a good Prince, Jr.
Who's a good guy?
It's called positive reinforcement, Eda.
And it works wonders.
Ha ha!
See?
Now watch this.
Prince, Jr. Attack Eda!
Knock over her drink!
Mess up her hair!
Well, I haven't seen your student in forever.
For all we know, she's not even loyal to you anymore.
Roll over!
Yes!
Heel!
Yes, yes!
So, did you find your runaway student?
By your expression, I can tell Luz has gone and found herself someplace else to learn.
Which means I have won!
Oh, Eda.
Don't say that.
At least you have this!
[He pulls out a shame cone and cackles.
I am so funny!
Ah, well, Prince, Jr, training complete.
Go forth!
Make the world tremble at your feet... or worm stubs.
Go forth?
[chuckles]
Right.
Help me, help me, help me!
Yes, yes!
Please help me!
You can call me Mr Wiggles!
Baby boy!
I have no son.
Eat salt!
Yes, I did it!
I'm amazing!
Ahh!
You helped too.
You are a good teacher.
Luz, you're getting all swoony again.
Rivals are meant to be annihilated not befriended.
Now keep reading.
I've been sucked into your awful fandom.
The book has come to life!
Burn it!
Fresh meat.
There's a note.
Take care of my child till morning.
You will be handsomely rewarded.
Good thinking.
Oh, boy.
It's been hours.
How can it keep screaming?
No amount of snails is worth this torture.
Make it stop.
Uh, for, for the money?
What silences children?
What if we invent a TV network for ages six to 11...
I miss my babies.
That's not a thing anyone ever wants.
Weh!
Stupid flag!
You have venom?
Quick, Luz, start melting faces!
No, I'll show you what to do.
You will tremble before me!
Weh!
You couldn't afford me, sister!
That's the incorrect reaction!
What does Luz know about problems anyway?
All she has is dumb teen drama!
She doesn't understand how hard some of us have it.
Well, I don't know if you realized, but I'm not a baby!
My life is a living nightmare!
Fight to the death!
Are you sure you don't shoot venom?
Yeah, it is.
I'm the human now.
Bow before my massive, meaty hands!
I've got some...
very confusing emotions right now.
Won't be me.
Life as a teen is a tyrant's dream!
By the end of the day, I'll be ruling over your feeble demographic.
My life's not a joke!
But yours is.
Bap.
Weh!
Not so high and mighty anymore.
I feel so alive!
Oh, no!
The flag, it seeks revenge.
I'll show Luz how to rule over these doofuses.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Bow before your king of humans.
Goody Two-Shoes, huh?
Hey, impressionable youths!
Under my command, you could learn how to do some real damage.
Nyeh!
All hail, your new teen king.
Who wants to revolt with me today?
All right, you acne-encrusted hormone buckets.
Let's go let out some teen angst!
Guys, be quiet.
I don't know what Luz is talking about.
This life is a breeze.
Ooh, I'm so scared.
She still thinks she has power over you guys.
Guys?
Meh.
Don't baby me!
Boscha, I accept your strange teenaged, coming-of-age challenge thing.
Let's go!
Worm minion, I said go!
Stop!
I said stop!
This is how the cool kids ride.
Super backwards.
On purpose.
Yes!
Say bye-bye to your popularity, Boscha.
Weh!
Luz was right.
I can't handle the complexities of teenage life.
I just want my body back.
Huh?
No, wait!
I am a little baby!
Lady, I just want my body back.
Dang!
I forgot about them.
My body!
My glorious little body!
Are they gonna be okay?
Nyeh!
You've been talking to them all morning.
Don't forget about the Luz and King comedy hour!
This week I've been working with props!
Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose!
Will I ever eat again?
Looks like I'm toast!
Why don't you bake me?
Hee hee, oh you!
You... you really think she's coming back this time?
The King of Demons misses nobody!
I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now!
You're back!
I didn't miss you at all.
That sounds like a crumby situation.
That's my kinda day!
Ooh, and destroying his life!
That was the best part!
You should really put a lock on your closet.
That's me!
I love crime!
Ooh, what's that?
Some kind of deadly string weapon.
Is that a type of deadly weapon?
Ooh!
That's a safer way than becoming blood brothers!
Luz, we must have those bracelets!
Beat up the man and steal his things for me.
Oh, okay.
Ahem.
Nyeh!
Um, sure.
Whatever you want, Luz.
Curse these stubby legs!
Weh?
Who said that?
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
That's what I was gonna say.
Wow!
You really are psychic.
You got my number, Obvioso.
Today was supposed to be about me and Luz, see?
But now she's distracted by her cool new school friends.
I'd say that sounds illegal.
I would also say go on.
Holy bones!
You poofed it.
Call the cops!
This guy's crazy!
Whoa!
You even know their names.
Guess there's no use arguing with a fortune-teller.
Thanks, Obvioso.
Hey.
Sidenote: in the future, do I ever find love?
Hmm, maybe I should think about this first.
Hey, it's okay.
Let's go back to the games and win those bracelets.
Games!
Games!
But today was me and Luz's day.
The King of Demons misses nobody.
I demand you put me down!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Actually, Luz.
There's something I gotta tell you.
Willow and Gus will be okay for a little while, right?
Now let's go!
Yes!
Ha ha!
Yes, Luz.
I want the bracelets.
It's kind of important to me, okay?
Count faster.
Yes. Yes!
Now Luz and I will share a bond as mighty as these trinkets!
Heya, Luz.
Good news.
I got the bracelets.
Huh?
Y-you weren't supposed to shrink.
You, you were supposed to disappear.
Ooh, no.
Wait.
No, no, no.
Luz, I can explain.
I wanted to win the bracelets and there was this psychic, see?
No, wait I-I-I gotta explain.
I was just trying to solve my problems.
Wait, I can fix it.
Obvioso showed me how.
Behold.
Why isn't this working?
Tapping my cheeks is supposed to turn us normal.
The psychic told me.
You fiend.
When Obvioso finds out you stole his mustache...
Ah, King, you idiot.
This is all your fault.
But I think I know how to fix it.
Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you.
And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends.
I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school.
I just... wanna be around you!
Alright.
I only have one shot.
Nyah!
Gus, Willow, you're okay!
It's... it's okay.
Because now there's a piece for everybody.
If you'll accept it, that is?
I'm sorry, Luz.
Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody.
Hey, we still have a few hours of carnival left.
Wanna hit those bumper carcasses?
Yes! Bread puns.
Bread puns forever.
Ooh!
Fight, fight, fight!
Aw, look what you did.
I'm gonna go rub it in.
Nyeh!
Dream on!
Boop!
You're a free ride to the best buffet in town!
Nyah!
The trash cans here are filled with half-eaten gold!
Have a wonderful school day, person-I-don't-know!
Nyah.
Uh, right!
I don't know you!
Time to scrounge through the trash...
I ain't no desk jockey.
Nyah!
Can it, Fangs!
You don't know diddly dang about squiddly squat!
Well, what is a teacher if not an authority figure?
A king of children, if you will.
Yes! I am your teacher!
You may call me Mr King!
Assume a coefficient of ten, carry the two, solve for Y, and that is the way to steal a pie from a windowsill!
Also you can eat trash.
And now, for my next lesson...
Seriously?
It's not even fifth period yet.
Excuse me!
Could you keep it down?
King's trying to mold young minds here!
I can see that I'm interrupting, so I'm just gonna...
Read chapters three to five on the right way to scratch yourself in public.
Spoiler alert: There's no wrong way!
Days like these make being a teacher all worth it.
Weh?
Maybe not, but I care about these kids, and nothing can change that.
Where are you now, ducky sock?
Oh, yeah.
Human Luz, you've been so obsessed with witchcraft that you haven't learned anything about my kind.
Prepare yourself for... Demons 101.
Demons like me are grim tricksters of the twilight, creatures of sulfur and bone.
And cute little paws.
True.
We live only to create chaos and misery.
Our only weaknesses are purified water and passive-aggressive comments.
Sometimes.
Even demons have inner demons.
The most powerful demon of all is the Snaggleback.
Luz, pay attention.
This information could save your life someday.
Uh-oh. Looks like it's gonna rain.
Hey, wait.
Look, now we're boo-boo buddies.
It's like a rainbow but looking at it turns you inside out.
And if the rain doesn't get you, the Snaggleback will.
They wander the rain, feeding on boiled tourists.
I think it's 'cause she gets distracted by shiny objects.
Uh-oh.
Moving a little slow.
Age finally catching up to ya?
Darkness!
But don't you wanna finish our lesson?
I was gonna let you scratch a demon's tummy.
Yawn!
Who needs another boring spell lesson when you could be learning all the fun ways a demon could kill you.
Look how teethy. Bite, bite.
Welp, looks like one more spell killed Eda.
Yep. She's out.
Just making sure.
Boiling rains, remember?
Remember when her head got cut off last week?
That woman can survive anything.
She's probably just tired from staying up all night chasing shrews and voles.
Should I bap her again?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you know what's really cryptish?
Let me tell you about the most spine-chilling demon.
Smoochy-pie the Sweetie Baby!
He's... Well, he's a lot more threatening than his name implies.
Why do you want to learn magic so bad, anyway?
If I help you learn that spell, could we finish our lesson?
Well, she said witches used to do magic differently, so there has to be a way, right?
And I have a theory.
Every day I notice Eda sneaking drinks of this special elixir, see?
Then she always gets a boost of energy, see?
I think that's where she gets her powers.
And I know where to get some.
King. I'm King.
Nice try.
An elixir a day.
Nyeh.
Nah.
Got it!
Who even needs a light spell when we have tons of lamps?
Hooty controls the house lights.
He probably just fell asleep.
Oh, my gosh.
It feeds during the rains.
It must have stumbled across our house and seen us inside.
Because this could be a lesson.
This would be a great way for you to see a wild demon up close and personal.
What if Eda gets eaten?
She's upstairs and defenseless because you knocked her out.
Weh!
She got snaggle-backed.
I'll go get my demon book.
Wait, wait.
First edition or second?
Luz?
The Snaggleback got her.
You craven beast.
Give me back my boo-boo buddy.
Luz?
There's nowhere for you to run!
Wow.
You are a lot shorter in person.
Then why did you break down our door and take Luz?
That's not cool, man.
Bad Snaggleback!
Huh?
Oh, my.
Stay back.
Hey, hey.
I am the king of demons, okay?
And as such, I demand you to barf my friends back up.
Luz?
Where did you go?
What's that?
Keeps the curse at bay.
An elixir a day, keeps the curse at bay.
I was wrong the whole time.
That's no Snaggleback.
Don't you see?
The elixir I gave you doesn't give Eda powers.
It prevents her from turning into that thing.
She's turned into a nightmare and it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry, Luz.
I-I just wanted you to be into demons like you're into magic.
I don't have many friends, and no one even pays that much attention to me.
I thought maybe if I taught you, finally someone would care about creatures like me.
Huh?
Let's see.
She was bigger, covered in feathers, and had giant black eyes.
Demons with black eyes are usually sensitive to light.
That's it.
Luz, use your human wonder rectangle.
Then... what about that light spell?
We're not going to stop anything with something that small.
What do we do now?
I'm kind of over that nickname.
But okay.
Oh, what lovely thing do we have here?
It's just so dang shiny.
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.
Actually, we found an extra one in your closet.
Shh!
Over there.
I don't know, but she did it all on her own.
Hey, I, uh, kind of messed a bunch of things up back there.
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Oh, you.
That voice.
That horrific voice!
Oh, yeah.
This will make a great addition to my demon book.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to edit that.
What?
What is happening?
Yeah, who cares?
I think not!
If you're handing out attention, I deserve it.
Nyeh!
You got nothing.
No one could turn down an interview with someone this pretty!
Weh?
Weh?
My decisiveness.
W-wa-Wait, I changed my mind!
No it wasn't!
If you want noise, I'll give you noise!
Hooty?
I'm gonna bake that kid into a pie!
Ugh.
Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here?
Get your own scalp, buddy.
This one’s taken.
Hard pass.
Yes!
Now I’ll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.
Point goes to Lilith.
We’re at a tie here, folks.
Ha ha!
Game over!
Team Owl House rules supreme!
You’re... You’re not gonna show this to anyone, right?
I am not your cutie-pie!
I know.
What?
But I just found the perfect spot.
Why do I have to go?
Huh!
Let's get this over with.
Hey, it's rude to stare.
Haven't seen any others.
Yeah.
Did Azura's path to greatness involve her delivering boil cream?
Good luck.
The Boiling Isles is nothing but a cesspool of despair.
I know I've had enough delight for one day.
Sorry to break it to you, Luz, but no one here is that well-dressed.
Big houses always belong to big whackjobs.
Let's kick the package inside and get outta here.
Hey, wait.
Weh!
Weird old man in jim-jams.
Let's scram!
Wizards are just old people with glitter in their pockets.
I don't trust him.
Where?
You should run a small business of more scones into my mouth.
Yes!
Neat story, awesome.
Anyway, your food is gone and we are, too.
Huh?
What?
Eda, tell Luz how dumb wizards are.
Your wizard client told Luz...
she was a... was a Chosen One!
He even gave her a map.
Finally!
All that mean-spirited laughter made me sleepy.
Yes.
Now go away.
Less talky, more nappy.
This is where we met the scones.
I mean, the wizard.
Whoa!
It wasn't like this before.
Can't mistake her smell.
Like lemons and young, naive confidence.
The cat man melted!
So, what do we do?
Yeah, and we're flying directly into his trap.
Hurray.
I didn't have to be a part of this!
Yeah.
The Boiling Isles, born from the flesh and bones of a fallen Titan.
This original magic was so potent, all life on the Isles evolved to wield magic too.
For years, we explored those power freely.
Until, a mysterious witch appeared who declared that he, and he alone, could speak to the island.
He said that we were using magic all wrong.
His teachings took hold, his strength grew, and he became... Emperor Belos.
Belos said that mixing magic was wrong, that only he had that right.
So he created the coven system.
And there, our knowledge was restricted, and our potential sealed away.
Those who resist are called wild witches, and they face harsh punishment.
Emperor Belos has since retreated into his castle.
There are whispers that say he's planning something big.
I wonder if catching Eda was part of his big plan.
What do you think, Luz?
Luz?
Luz, what are you doing?
Haven't you been listening to me?
He's the Emperor!
He's the most powerful witch alive!
But she's in her Owl Beast form!
How will she even recognize you?
Well then, I'm going too.
Me and Eda don't always see eye to eye, but I do consider her family.
I want her back as much as you do.
Nyeh!
Petrification is only done to the worst criminals, and once the spell is complete, it can't be reversed.
Luz, calm down.
We need to think about saving Eda first!
There's not gonna be a new statue going up today.
Right, Luz?
Luz?
Weh.
Let me go!
Luz!
Luz, watch out!
Weh?
Hey Luz, You... need a minute?
No, don't!
She was trying to help.
She even betrayed the Emperor for you!
Wh-- what do we do?
