Who dares intrude upon I, the king of demons?
I don't know who your little guy is!
Eda, who is this monster?
Hooray!
Please don't encourage her!
Nyeh!
Soon, Mr Ducky, we shall drink the fear of those who mocked us.
Try to catch me when I'm covered in grease.
I'm a squirmy little fella.
Aah!
You and I will sneak up to the top of the tower, where they're holding my crown.
It's hideous.
Ha-ha!
Cat's don't do that.
Not yet, you're not.
My crown!
It's close!
I can sense its power!
Oh, yeah.
My crown!
Yes. Yes! I can feel my powers returning!
I shall call you Francois, and you shall be a minion in my army of darkness.
Ha-ha!
Weh?
My power!
Ow, my bones!
If you think this guy is bad, you shoulda seen her last boyfriend!
That was actually one of her better breakups.
This shall suffice.
You there, plant!
You are now under my command.
Let her stay!
She can make us snacks.
Too tight!
Too tight!
Your sleep cocoon looks fluffy.
Hey!
Less ready, more scratchy!
Nyah!
Is it my birthday?
Ooo, gimme gimme gimme!
Yes!
Another worthy addition to my army of terror!
Truly horrifying!
Yeah!
This bear could be our new Luz.
You're unbearable!
Did someone say boot camp?
I agree to run it.
We'll rise at dawn!
You'll carry me on your back as I yell hateful things about your performance!
I am not adorable!
This is ludicrous!
I once led armies.
I can lead a dang boot camp!
But I have no recruits.
Or do I?
Ugh, no!
You are too desperate!
Role call!
Oh, you're perfect already!
As for the rest of you, I'm only saying this once so listen up!
Huh it's no fun if they don't tremble.
Ohh okay, alright.
Yep, an idea is happening!
Military discipline, cooking!
Ha, I truly am a demon for all seasons!
Just a dash of Eda's secret sauce and I'm the creator of life!
Yes, yes, yes!
My loyal recruits!
Welcome to boot camp!
You sure need it.
Look at you: raggedy, pathetic, chewed on, you got a button hangin' off of your eye.
Pathetic!
But I'll mold you worms into... slightly... better kinds of worms.
Your first mission: gimme snacks!
Your commander is hungry, so pick it up!
Hey, Private Dingdong, snacks are that-a-way!
You better shape up recruit, you're in my boot camp now.
Yep, keep 'em coming.
And don't forget the pretzels this time.
Running a boot camp is tough work, but as my second-in-command, you deserve this.
Hey, hey!
You're not privy to snacking privileges, back away!
Leading this boot camp has tuckered a little guy out, so Sergeant King signing off.
Excuse me?
Could you maybe turn down those eyeballs?
Trying to sleep.
Hey!
How dare you mutiny!
Unhand your commander right now!
I gave you life, I can take it away!
Hooty, Hooty!
Great news, buddy, you can be in the boot camp!
First task: destroy the boot camp.
What?
But you begged to join!
Ugh!
What do you want?
This day shall live in infamy.
Private Hooty, today when the felt flew you showed grit and determination that were instrumental in securing our victory.
May I just say, it has been an honor, to be your commander.
Private, our hearts have been touched by fire, and... Um, excuse me? We're having a moment here!
Ugh, moment ruined.
Weh?
King demands huggies too!
Cape? I thought you were making cake!
I, uh... anyway!
If there's no cake, then I have to get to work!
Would you look at us two, being all generous to that kid.
You know what, when she first got here, I thought we were gonna eat her.
But now I only think of that, like, sometimes.
Wait!
Wait for me!
You're not the only one who knows dark magic!
Now stop gawking and load me in!
Gentle!
The cake is me!
Hey, um, where's Eda?
Show me the picture.
Show me the picture!
Hah!
I can draw better than that.
You know, they once called me the King of Artists.
Doesn't matter.
What's important is that my followers would leave me offerings in fear of me!
Weh?
Destiny?
Feh!
Are you bestowing gifts upon me?
Yes! I accept your offering!
The King of Demons is back!
Cupcakes in my tummy-tum makes the King say yummy-yum!
Hmm... Nope!
Oh, hey, Luz!
Wah!
I'm not a pet!
Good night, sweet child.
Do it, Luz!
For my honor!
Mmm?
Oh, yeah.
Things that are free?
People are giving offerings to me!
I love offerings!
What did I miss?
Weh?
This I gotta see!
Hey!
You root for Luz or nobody!
Mmm?
I'm okay!
Luz! Help me!
My offerings!
Hey, wait for me!
Luz! You left me!
Nah.
That stuff just weighed me down.
But I have something for you, Luz.
And it's the best thing, because it's free, comes from my heart, and I always have more than I need.
Ugh!
Tote bags!
And they have so many uses! 
Away, fair chariot! Away!
You very much don't!
You think that's impressive?
Check this out!
Two warriors battling to the death!
Senseless violence.
Yes, attack!
Death is your god!
Hah!
What possible regrets could come from the internet?
Did you know that the Earth is actually flat?
Ah, a severed hand!
Perfect response.
Nah, she'd be freaked out by our world anyway.
So actually, by keeping the truth from her, you're doing her a favor!
Always trust a shoulder demon!
I forge my own path!
What a dum-dum.
Ugh.
Who has the energy?
Why am I doing this?
I don't even wear clothes!
And Gus asked me to co-emcee the fight!
We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath!
A great joke, Luz!
Uh, maybe you were too hard on her.
She's saved you from multiple monsters, remember?
Girl, you can pull off anything!
Up top!
We're style geniuses!
Why so twitchy, witchy?
Trying to remember if I've ever seen you this nervous before.
Wow, Gus is really good at this.
They're hanging on his every word!
Whoo, I, uh, hope my material's up to snuff.
Whoah!
What do you think will go better with the youths, close-up magic or impressions?
Aaahh!
Hel-LO, Hexside!
Oh, oh gosh.
Um... whoooo.
Wow, these lights are warm.
Observe!
Luz, is um... she's down there, all right.
And, uh, yes she is!
There she goes!
You will clap for me!
Please?
Nothing!
Leave me be!
Well if that's the rule...
Oh, how can this be?
I get stage fright!
The king of demons!
I know, I know.
Imagine everyone in their underwear.
I dunno.
I always do that.
I am a little weirdo.
Gimme!
King of Demons, you got this.
Well, folks, looks like our show literally just took off!
Weh?
Uh, took off just like your local sports team would take off when they're about to make a goal?
Yeah, that's right, so let's follow them and see what happens next.
And there you have it, folks.
A happy ending for this year's Grom.
Let's give a big hand to our Grom queens, Luz and Amity!
Of course I did it!
I'm the King of Demons and I've never had stage fright in my life!
They love me!
Now I am King and Queen!
Best of both things!
Your curse is returning!
I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down!
I know the pain.
Yeah, busy playing Hexes Hold'em.
She's obsessed with it.
You're playing it right now!
Like me!
Whoa!
Jelly beans!
He wants to be called that.
Really?
Now?
Oof.
That was painful to watch.
I don't look good in clothes.
I'm all-natural.
Eda, do something!
King?
Who's King?
I go by Little Bone Boy now.
You promise?
Okay, okay.
I'll grab you the elixir and then we can bust out of here.
Heh?
Just because I have a model's body doesn't mean you can use me like this.
Eda, quick!
I can't believe they animated a whole house.
Aw, come on, Luz.
It's not every day you get to go to the dump and pick apart a garbage carcass.
Lose apprentice, gain garbage eggs.
Fair trade.
If you don't teach Luz right, you will.
And that's when I come in, make her my apprentice.
Hey, that only happened once!
I'd teach her about demons.
How to identify them, talk to 'em, raise an army with them and tear apart the world!
You think you're so smart!
Well, why don't we make a little bet where I can prove that I'd make a better teacher.
I like those odds.
Well, when you lose, you'll have to... wear a shame hat and sleep in a shack and never come into the Owl House again!
Who's a good Prince, Jr.
Who's a good guy?
It's called positive reinforcement, Eda.
And it works wonders.
Ha ha!
See?
Now watch this.
Prince, Jr. Attack Eda!
Knock over her drink!
Mess up her hair!
Well, I haven't seen your student in forever.
For all we know, she's not even loyal to you anymore.
Roll over!
Yes!
Heel!
Yes, yes!
So, did you find your runaway student?
By your expression, I can tell Luz has gone and found herself someplace else to learn.
Which means I have won!
Oh, Eda.
Don't say that.
At least you have this!
[He pulls out a shame cone and cackles.
I am so funny!
Ah, well, Prince, Jr, training complete.
Go forth!
Make the world tremble at your feet... or worm stubs.
Go forth?
[chuckles]
Right.
Help me, help me, help me!
Yes, yes!
Please help me!
You can call me Mr Wiggles!
Baby boy!
I have no son.
Eat salt!
Yes, I did it!
I'm amazing!
Ahh!
You helped too.
You are a good teacher.
Luz, you're getting all swoony again.
Rivals are meant to be annihilated not befriended.
Now keep reading.
I've been sucked into your awful fandom.
The book has come to life!
Burn it!
Fresh meat.
There's a note.
Take care of my child till morning.
You will be handsomely rewarded.
Good thinking.
Oh, boy.
It's been hours.
How can it keep screaming?
No amount of snails is worth this torture.
Make it stop.
Uh, for, for the money?
What silences children?
What if we invent a TV network for ages six to 11...
I miss my babies.
That's not a thing anyone ever wants.
Weh!
Stupid flag!
You have venom?
Quick, Luz, start melting faces!
No, I'll show you what to do.
You will tremble before me!
Weh!
You couldn't afford me, sister!
That's the incorrect reaction!
What does Luz know about problems anyway?
All she has is dumb teen drama!
She doesn't understand how hard some of us have it.
Well, I don't know if you realized, but I'm not a baby!
My life is a living nightmare!
Fight to the death!
Are you sure you don't shoot venom?
Yeah, it is.
I'm the human now.
Bow before my massive, meaty hands!
I've got some...
very confusing emotions right now.
Won't be me.
Life as a teen is a tyrant's dream!
By the end of the day, I'll be ruling over your feeble demographic.
My life's not a joke!
But yours is.
Bap.
Weh!
Not so high and mighty anymore.
I feel so alive!
Oh, no!
The flag, it seeks revenge.
I'll show Luz how to rule over these doofuses.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Bow before your king of humans.
Goody Two-Shoes, huh?
Hey, impressionable youths!
Under my command, you could learn how to do some real damage.
Nyeh!
All hail, your new teen king.
Who wants to revolt with me today?
All right, you acne-encrusted hormone buckets.
Let's go let out some teen angst!
Guys, be quiet.
I don't know what Luz is talking about.
This life is a breeze.
Ooh, I'm so scared.
She still thinks she has power over you guys.
Guys?
Meh.
Don't baby me!
Boscha, I accept your strange teenaged, coming-of-age challenge thing.
Let's go!
Worm minion, I said go!
Stop!
I said stop!
This is how the cool kids ride.
Super backwards.
On purpose.
Yes!
Say bye-bye to your popularity, Boscha.
Weh!
Luz was right.
I can't handle the complexities of teenage life.
I just want my body back.
Huh?
No, wait!
I am a little baby!
Lady, I just want my body back.
Dang!
I forgot about them.
My body!
My glorious little body!
Are they gonna be okay?
Nyeh!
You've been talking to them all morning.
Don't forget about the Luz and King comedy hour!
This week I've been working with props!
Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose!
Will I ever eat again?
Looks like I'm toast!
Why don't you bake me?
Hee hee, oh you!
You... you really think she's coming back this time?
The King of Demons misses nobody!
I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now!
You're back!
I didn't miss you at all.
That sounds like a crumby situation.
That's my kinda day!
Ooh, and destroying his life!
That was the best part!
You should really put a lock on your closet.
That's me!
I love crime!
Ooh, what's that?
Some kind of deadly string weapon.
Is that a type of deadly weapon?
Ooh!
That's a safer way than becoming blood brothers!
Luz, we must have those bracelets!
Beat up the man and steal his things for me.
Oh, okay.
Ahem.
Nyeh!
Um, sure.
Whatever you want, Luz.
Curse these stubby legs!
Weh?
Who said that?
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
That's what I was gonna say.
Wow!
You really are psychic.
You got my number, Obvioso.
Today was supposed to be about me and Luz, see?
But now she's distracted by her cool new school friends.
I'd say that sounds illegal.
I would also say go on.
Holy bones!
You poofed it.
Call the cops!
This guy's crazy!
Whoa!
You even know their names.
Guess there's no use arguing with a fortune-teller.
Thanks, Obvioso.
Hey.
Sidenote: in the future, do I ever find love?
Hmm, maybe I should think about this first.
Hey, it's okay.
Let's go back to the games and win those bracelets.
Games!
Games!
But today was me and Luz's day.
The King of Demons misses nobody.
I demand you put me down!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Actually, Luz.
There's something I gotta tell you.
Willow and Gus will be okay for a little while, right?
Now let's go!
Yes!
Ha ha!
Yes, Luz.
I want the bracelets.
It's kind of important to me, okay?
Count faster.
Yes. Yes!
Now Luz and I will share a bond as mighty as these trinkets!
Heya, Luz.
Good news.
I got the bracelets.
Huh?
Y-you weren't supposed to shrink.
You, you were supposed to disappear.
Ooh, no.
Wait.
No, no, no.
Luz, I can explain.
I wanted to win the bracelets and there was this psychic, see?
No, wait I-I-I gotta explain.
I was just trying to solve my problems.
Wait, I can fix it.
Obvioso showed me how.
Behold.
Why isn't this working?
Tapping my cheeks is supposed to turn us normal.
The psychic told me.
You fiend.
When Obvioso finds out you stole his mustache...
Ah, King, you idiot.
This is all your fault.
But I think I know how to fix it.
Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you.
And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends.
I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school.
I just... wanna be around you!
Alright.
I only have one shot.
Nyah!
Gus, Willow, you're okay!
It's... it's okay.
Because now there's a piece for everybody.
If you'll accept it, that is?
I'm sorry, Luz.
Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody.
Hey, we still have a few hours of carnival left.
Wanna hit those bumper carcasses?
Yes! Bread puns.
Bread puns forever.
Ooh!
Fight, fight, fight!
Aw, look what you did.
I'm gonna go rub it in.
Nyeh!
Dream on!
Boop!
You're a free ride to the best buffet in town!
Nyah!
The trash cans here are filled with half-eaten gold!
Have a wonderful school day, person-I-don't-know!
Nyah.
Uh, right!
I don't know you!
Time to scrounge through the trash...
I ain't no desk jockey.
Nyah!
Can it, Fangs!
You don't know diddly dang about squiddly squat!
Well, what is a teacher if not an authority figure?
A king of children, if you will.
Yes! I am your teacher!
You may call me Mr King!
Assume a coefficient of ten, carry the two, solve for Y, and that is the way to steal a pie from a windowsill!
Also you can eat trash.
And now, for my next lesson...
Seriously?
It's not even fifth period yet.
Excuse me!
Could you keep it down?
King's trying to mold young minds here!
I can see that I'm interrupting, so I'm just gonna...
Read chapters three to five on the right way to scratch yourself in public.
Spoiler alert: There's no wrong way!
Days like these make being a teacher all worth it.
Weh?
Maybe not, but I care about these kids, and nothing can change that.
Where are you now, ducky sock?
Oh, yeah.
Human Luz, you've been so obsessed with witchcraft that you haven't learned anything about my kind.
Prepare yourself for... Demons 101.
Demons like me are grim tricksters of the twilight, creatures of sulfur and bone.
And cute little paws.
True.
We live only to create chaos and misery.
Our only weaknesses are purified water and passive-aggressive comments.
Sometimes.
Even demons have inner demons.
The most powerful demon of all is the Snaggleback.
Luz, pay attention.
This information could save your life someday.
Uh-oh. Looks like it's gonna rain.
Hey, wait.
Look, now we're boo-boo buddies.
It's like a rainbow but looking at it turns you inside out.
And if the rain doesn't get you, the Snaggleback will.
They wander the rain, feeding on boiled tourists.
I think it's 'cause she gets distracted by shiny objects.
Uh-oh.
Moving a little slow.
Age finally catching up to ya?
Darkness!
But don't you wanna finish our lesson?
I was gonna let you scratch a demon's tummy.
Yawn!
Who needs another boring spell lesson when you could be learning all the fun ways a demon could kill you.
Look how teethy. Bite, bite.
Welp, looks like one more spell killed Eda.
Yep. She's out.
Just making sure.
Boiling rains, remember?
Remember when her head got cut off last week?
That woman can survive anything.
She's probably just tired from staying up all night chasing shrews and voles.
Should I bap her again?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you know what's really cryptish?
Let me tell you about the most spine-chilling demon.
Smoochy-pie the Sweetie Baby!
He's... Well, he's a lot more threatening than his name implies.
Why do you want to learn magic so bad, anyway?
If I help you learn that spell, could we finish our lesson?
Well, she said witches used to do magic differently, so there has to be a way, right?
And I have a theory.
Every day I notice Eda sneaking drinks of this special elixir, see?
Then she always gets a boost of energy, see?
I think that's where she gets her powers.
And I know where to get some.
King. I'm King.
Nice try.
An elixir a day.
Nyeh.
Nah.
Got it!
Who even needs a light spell when we have tons of lamps?
Hooty controls the house lights.
He probably just fell asleep.
Oh, my gosh.
It feeds during the rains.
It must have stumbled across our house and seen us inside.
Because this could be a lesson.
This would be a great way for you to see a wild demon up close and personal.
What if Eda gets eaten?
She's upstairs and defenseless because you knocked her out.
Weh!
She got snaggle-backed.
I'll go get my demon book.
Wait, wait.
First edition or second?
Luz?
The Snaggleback got her.
You craven beast.
Give me back my boo-boo buddy.
Luz?
There's nowhere for you to run!
Wow.
You are a lot shorter in person.
Then why did you break down our door and take Luz?
That's not cool, man.
Bad Snaggleback!
Huh?
Oh, my.
Stay back.
Hey, hey.
I am the king of demons, okay?
And as such, I demand you to barf my friends back up.
Luz?
Where did you go?
What's that?
Keeps the curse at bay.
An elixir a day, keeps the curse at bay.
I was wrong the whole time.
That's no Snaggleback.
Don't you see?
The elixir I gave you doesn't give Eda powers.
It prevents her from turning into that thing.
She's turned into a nightmare and it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry, Luz.
I-I just wanted you to be into demons like you're into magic.
I don't have many friends, and no one even pays that much attention to me.
I thought maybe if I taught you, finally someone would care about creatures like me.
Huh?
Let's see.
She was bigger, covered in feathers, and had giant black eyes.
Demons with black eyes are usually sensitive to light.
That's it.
Luz, use your human wonder rectangle.
Then... what about that light spell?
We're not going to stop anything with something that small.
What do we do now?
I'm kind of over that nickname.
But okay.
Oh, what lovely thing do we have here?
It's just so dang shiny.
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.
Actually, we found an extra one in your closet.
Shh!
Over there.
I don't know, but she did it all on her own.
Hey, I, uh, kind of messed a bunch of things up back there.
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Oh, you.
That voice.
That horrific voice!
Oh, yeah.
This will make a great addition to my demon book.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to edit that.
What?
What is happening?
Yeah, who cares?
I think not!
If you're handing out attention, I deserve it.
Nyeh!
You got nothing.
No one could turn down an interview with someone this pretty!
Weh?
Weh?
My decisiveness.
W-wa-Wait, I changed my mind!
No it wasn't!
If you want noise, I'll give you noise!
Hooty?
I'm gonna bake that kid into a pie!
Ugh.
Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here?
Get your own scalp, buddy.
This one’s taken.
Hard pass.
Yes!
Now I’ll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.
Point goes to Lilith.
We’re at a tie here, folks.
Ha ha!
Game over!
Team Owl House rules supreme!
You’re... You’re not gonna show this to anyone, right?
I am not your cutie-pie!
I know.
What?
But I just found the perfect spot.
Why do I have to go?
Huh!
Let's get this over with.
Hey, it's rude to stare.
Haven't seen any others.
Yeah.
Did Azura's path to greatness involve her delivering boil cream?
Good luck.
The Boiling Isles is nothing but a cesspool of despair.
I know I've had enough delight for one day.
Sorry to break it to you, Luz, but no one here is that well-dressed.
Big houses always belong to big whackjobs.
Let's kick the package inside and get outta here.
Hey, wait.
Weh!
Weird old man in jim-jams.
Let's scram!
Wizards are just old people with glitter in their pockets.
I don't trust him.
Where?
You should run a small business of more scones into my mouth.
Yes!
Neat story, awesome.
Anyway, your food is gone and we are, too.
Huh?
What?
Eda, tell Luz how dumb wizards are.
Your wizard client told Luz...
she was a... was a Chosen One!
He even gave her a map.
Finally!
All that mean-spirited laughter made me sleepy.
Yes.
Now go away.
Less talky, more nappy.
This is where we met the scones.
I mean, the wizard.
Whoa!
It wasn't like this before.
Can't mistake her smell.
Like lemons and young, naive confidence.
The cat man melted!
So, what do we do?
Yeah, and we're flying directly into his trap.
Hurray.
I didn't have to be a part of this!
Yeah.
The Boiling Isles, born from the flesh and bones of a fallen Titan.
This original magic was so potent, all life on the Isles evolved to wield magic too.
For years, we explored those power freely.
Until, a mysterious witch appeared who declared that he, and he alone, could speak to the island.
He said that we were using magic all wrong.
His teachings took hold, his strength grew, and he became... Emperor Belos.
Belos said that mixing magic was wrong, that only he had that right.
So he created the coven system.
And there, our knowledge was restricted, and our potential sealed away.
Those who resist are called wild witches, and they face harsh punishment.
Emperor Belos has since retreated into his castle.
There are whispers that say he's planning something big.
I wonder if catching Eda was part of his big plan.
What do you think, Luz?
Luz?
Luz, what are you doing?
Haven't you been listening to me?
He's the Emperor!
He's the most powerful witch alive!
But she's in her Owl Beast form!
How will she even recognize you?
Well then, I'm going too.
Me and Eda don't always see eye to eye, but I do consider her family.
I want her back as much as you do.
Nyeh!
Petrification is only done to the worst criminals, and once the spell is complete, it can't be reversed.
Luz, calm down.
We need to think about saving Eda first!
There's not gonna be a new statue going up today.
Right, Luz?
Luz?
Weh.
Let me go!
Luz!
Luz, watch out!
Weh?
Hey Luz, You... need a minute?
No, don't!
She was trying to help.
She even betrayed the Emperor for you!
What do we do?
King... King!
Special delivery!
Ta-da!
Anything else I can do?
Grab some tea, defeat some baddies, create sentient life, I am a Titan-
Stop talking like that.
This isn't goodbye!
I command it!
Already a legend, and the most horrifying one of them all!
I'll... do my best.
Luz, I need your help!
I think Francois is trying to start a rebellion.
It's always glyphs and portals with you these days.
What about King?
What's going on?
Is Hooty blackmailing her?
Don't ever do that again!
An ambush!
Men, defend your ruler!
The King of Demons yields to no one!
Blasphemy!
Clearly, you know nothing of my reign of terror.
Allow me to tell you.
I was once the mighty King of Demons.
I was beloved almost as much as I was feared.
But one dark day, an evil spell was cast... transforming me into this!
A trifle!
That was just to test Eda and Luz's dedication to me!
They passed.
My real crown is still out there.
But when I shrank, my memories got, uh... fuzzy.
Hey, I remember plenty!
I remember armies bowing before me, being served the greatest of feasts... and falling from a massive height as evil hex shrank me.
One day, I'll return to my rightful place... and all shall fear me!
It's me!
Don't blame me for your ignorance.
I'm not a liar, and I can prove it.
All right, you two shall regret ever doubting me.
We're going to my castle!
Off to my real castle!
Don't wait up!
Love, your favorite demon overlord.
There it is!
It's always been there when I looked for it.
After I shrunk, I woke up here, in Eda's arms, and she carried me away.
Like a wittle baby.
Ah, home sweet home.
The treetops are so thick, this is the only way in.
Plus, now I can dramatically do this!
That's me!
I'll find you guys another way in.
Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!
What's a mystery?
You so are.
Come on in.
Ah, the chamber where I would devour the hearts of my foes.
The taste was cold and bitter, but I bet yours would be sweet, Luz.
Can't believe your eyes, huh?
My castle does have that effect.
Ah, my kingdom.
I, uh... I got some bone dust in my eye.
I-I can't quite recall.
I just remember a muffled roar, probably some minion praising my name.
I suppose I could, uh, regale you with some tales.
Am I using that word right?
Regale?
I'll show you where my throne used to be.
It was made from the teeth of my enemies and... Boy, was it awkward to sit in.
And that's how I would annihilate my enemies.
Who needs due process, am I right?
Uh, it's hard to remember.
But that handsome devil looks familiar, huh?
Ah, you saw the horrifying monstrosity room.
Don't worry, they can't hurt you.
But it's my castle.
How could we be intruders?
You don't believe this is my castle.
Luz, you think I would lie to you?
Y-You’re lying!
My army? My feasts.. My life... AAH!
Keep that thing away from me!
It's messing with my head!
Y-You're all just making fun of me, like usual, right?
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Eda was right, wasn't she?
I was never king of anything.
I'm nobody.
Everyone lied!
And I was too caught up in the fantasy to realize it!
I... I don't know what to do, Luz!
I can't tell what's real and what's fake!
Probably another stupid thing I made up!
Why does it matter?
I don't know, Luz.
What if the story gets worse?
Boop.
No more secrets, okay?
You have to promise me.
There's... IT'S COMING!
I'm not sure, but I think I know how to jog my memory.
Eda, I'm ready.
I remember a deep roar.
And then, something happened... but I was too small to do anything.
So, I went back to sleep.
And the next time I woke up... that roar.
It meant son.
I don't know how I know that, but I do.
Someone called me their son.
Luz, I think it was my dad!
I was important to someone.
If... If he's out there, I want to find him.
I'm not that old!
It could be possible!
Would you help me?
Then... can we keep him?
That symbol was all over that tower.
What if it's my name?
It's too bad Jean-Luc stopped moving outside the ruins.
I liked having a big, scary minion.
Luz, is it okay to still call me King?
It feels kind of weird when I'm not the king of anything.
Yeah!
Goodnight, Luz.
And Francois.
Now, Jean-Luc.
Something called Lo-fi beats to study and relax to.
We've got it all!
Feels like just a few months ago you almost got her dissected by your crazy principal!
Yes!
Perfect chance to take our new powers for a test drive!
This place is crawling with tools.
What gives?
Well, that was easy!
No, you just screamed hoot and ran headfirst into a wall of ice.
Pretty funny actually.
Sounds perfectly safe!
Haha, okay!
WEHHHHH!
Hey come on, give it a rest you two.
You look like one of my hairballs.
Let's just do the trench coat thing!
Who cares?
We did it!
I'm just like throwing it out there, but this would be a great time to bring out Harpy Eda.
Did you ever think about, talking to it?
You thought I was a wild animal once.
What did you promise to do?
I can't wait to see a real life minecart chase!
Guess minecart chases are a lot more dangerous than video games make'em seem.
This is really bumming me out.
What's he talking about?
She also ate like, nine voles on the way home.
No King hug?
What is this?
You are a swindler and a thief!
I regret this!
And weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh!
And ten thousand!
Well, once we're done training, I'm gonna move out of that closet, that's for sure.
Then, I'm going to ugly cry.
Hard!
I-- I'm not ready yet.
I'm not sure how she'll react.
I'm sorry, Luz.
In the meantime, this weekend is the Gland Prix!
Fame!
Winners also get an interview with the Boiling Isles news!
Do you realize what this means?
But, uh... there's something I'd like to talk to you about first.
I, uh, got the jitters.
And I still haven't been able to talk to Eda.
You don't have any shoulders!
Stay away from me!
I, uh, would really like to tell you something before the race starts.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Haha!
Saint Epiderm?
More like Stank Epiderm!
Might wanna slow down for that turn, Luz.
We're gonna crash!
I can't!
It's okay.
I'll just throw my message into the garbage where it belongs.
Eda, who's even gonna watch this?
All right.
Hi dad.
If you're out there watching this, I uh, want to introduce myself.
I like cheesy foods and conquering kingdoms.
Though I haven't conquered any of my own yet.
But maybe you have, and we can compare notes.
I'd love to meet you.
We could do parent kid stuff, toss a ball, burn some cookies, catch me going on weird websites or something.
Also, I found a symbol in the tower I hatched in.
Maybe you can teach me to read it.
I live with my favorite human and a cranky old witch.
But cranky or not, she's the one who raised me, which is why I am legally changing my name to King Clawthorne!
Surprise Eda!
Now we're connected for life and there's nothing you can do about it!
Thanks.
I- I hope they like it too.
They're here!
King of Dads!
You made it!
Really?
I can start!
I'm thankful that my demon family finally got to meet my owl family.
Seriously, thi- this is amazing!
I- It's almost like... a dream... NYEH!
What's going on?
Is there trouble?
Huh?
WEH!
He's also been eating our mail.
Look!
Dear King Clawthorne, if you wish to know who you truly are, come to this location and meet our warrior clan.
 I think they might be my family!
And maybe they're an answer to all our problems!
They're a clan of warriors!
How else do you defeat a tyrant with their own army?
By making an army of your own!
Yeah!
The ole Selkidomus crew.
Think about it!
Belos won't be able to withstand a whole army of mes.
Let's pack for the trip!
Doin' a lot of work there, Salty.
Where's the crew?
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh!
Or maybe they got sick of waiting!
That letter was over a month old... Whoa!
Luz, look!
Uh, y-yeah!
'Tis King!
Right!
Uh, this is Luz the human/friend/sister.
And this is Hooty, the, uh, door...
Did you send me that letter?
I've never seen so many demons that look like me!
Look at them go!
That's right!
It's a lot to explain right now, but could you- I mean, we, help the people of the Boiling Isles?
Luz!
Luz!
Look what that gave me!
Don't worry.
It's mostly paper mache.
And bone.
They're gonna show me their Titan Trapper ways, Luz!
I guess they're my ways, too.
This is a dream come true!
I will!
Whoa!
There's all sorts of things I shouldn't touch.
You would do that?
Can you also tell me what this means?
Can I ask a favor?
It's a little silly, but, uh... Can we play catch?
Is something wrong?
You don't have to go all out like this.
I- I'm fine doing a small thing.
Family and friends kinda thing.
D- Did you hear that?
Then we get to play catch, right?
Weh?
Wha- what's happening?
What're you talking about?
We were just about to play catch!
These guys wouldn't hurt me.
They get me!
They know what it's like to be left behind.
I mean, yeah, but it's you too, Luz!
You'll eventually go back to the Human Realm, I know how it works.
I've read your Azura books.
You even promised your mom.
I just thought I had to... prepare for a world without you in it.
Then what am I?
Stop fighting!
I'm one of you guys!
Then step back.
I wanna go home.
Um... The Collector.
I've never heard that name.
I get to meet my grandpa?
What's with you?
Why are you so terrified of seeing your dad?
Hey, Eda, look!
Dear sister, join the Emperor's Coven and together, we can become gods!
Just let her have this.
Hahah, power!
Weh?
Yeah yeah, I'll deal with it.
No one ever said power came with responsibility...
And what are you expecting this glyph pyramid to do?
But those are disgusting liquids, these are symbols from the isles.
Maybe there's a different way to combine them.
Maybe if you just learn the basics like Luz said-
Eda, wh- what the heck is that supposed to be?
More like, a stupid glyph.
Uh, i- is it supposed to do that?
Eda, help me!
Help me, Eda!
Eda, HELP ME!
Ah-choo!
A-a-b-b-bout t-t-time!
Maybe the reason Luz hasn't found any more glyphs is because there... aren't any more.
Ah-choo!
Come on, Luz.
There’s no way your mom will make you leave the Demon Realm!
They’re probably prepping for the annual Coven Day Parade.
Floats, streamers, fireworks
Hey, Luz!
I know what’ll cheer you up.
What?
I’m talkin’ about hot goss, girl!
Hot goss buns.
Bread pun.
Guess why we’re here!
Eda hired someone to spy on her ex!
And they’re Head Witch of the Bard Coven!
And they also
Ooh.
I didn’t read that far.
It was the… yeast I could do.
Ooh!
Wait, are these legal?
With my love of mayhem and Hooty’s desperate need for attention, this’ll be a cake walk!
Hooty, what would you know?
Mission success, Hooty!
Now, how do we get outta here?
Free of wild magic?
How’s he supposed to do that?
Is this thing on?
Demon King to Luzura, you copy?
Use the walkie!
Uh, oh.
No one wants to think they've wasted their life following the wrong person.
You just gotta find something big to change their minds.
Well, we're gonna get you out!
We'll make a return spell as fast as we can!
Eda?
Tell me it's... gonna be okay.
Figure it out later.
Now we can save Luz.
Use this!
She'll never get home if she doesn't get back here!
What the heck happened in there?
Just squeeze it out!
We could've used the door!
Now you can make your own palismen!
Was robbed!
By us!
Isn't it amazing, Francois?
If Eda's mom can just pop up, who says my dad can't?
NYEH!
Better get my hugging arms ready.
Don't listen to her, Francois.
My dad won't be like that.
How do you get a parent's attention?
At least you know what she looks like.
All I have is an old wall carving.
What if that's just graffiti?
This stinks.
If my dad doesn't care about me, why should I care about him?
Hmm?
Well, I'm not going to him.
He's gonna have to come to me!
It's not taking it far enough.
Go tell her.
Go on.
She's right outside.
Yeah, I saw her go off with Luz.
I think they're gonna heal Eda's curse or whatever.
You got, uh, uh... You got a little, uh, hmm.
So Lilith was feeling stressed and, uh, the light glyph didn't really work.
So, uh... uh... uh... SHE TURNED INTO THAT THING!
Were you not paying any attention to her?
Yeah, are you like, secretly sending us to our deaths?
She was... trying to do her best, huh?
You lived here?
You actually want that?
No, wait!
I call couch.
Can you keep it down?
Down!
Down!
Why does this keep happening?
Ugh!
Why does that sound so wrong coming from you?
YOU!
I am done with this!
Maybe if I figure out what kind of demon I am, I’ll know what’s going on.
But nothing in here looks like me!
Ugh!
Ugh!
AAH!
DID YOU OWL PELLET ME?
UGH!
The last thing I want from you is a health class!
Really?
Eh… all right.
What the heck.
Yeah okay, everyone knows about the three Bs
Can we-just not talk about the cocoon?
A scuffle, eh?
All right, all right, let’s do it.
Just uh… don’t get mad if you can’t-
It-it’s fine!
It’s fine.
Let’s just keep going.
Lay it on me.
Beast, bug, biped, I don’t care.
I just want to know what I am!
I-I thought you had real answers
I don’t need you to tell me to love myself, Hooty.
I want to know where I came from.
What my Dad looked like.
What I’ll look like when I grow up.
I don’t have any responses to my video, yet, or my wanted posters.
Maybe my Dad is gone, maybe there’s no one else like me, and I’ll live my whole life without any answers!
Well I am mad, at him, for not being here!
He left me... ALONE!
Hooty?
Hooty!
Hooty!
Calm down, you ding-dong!
AAAAAH!
Luz!
LUZ!
RUN!
I… I think I did?
I think I got a power!
And I can explode things with my voice powers!
Quick!
Pretend he helped you, before he destroys everything!
Luz?
Hooty?
Woah, woah!
Is someone there?
Hello, hello?
What... Is that Amity?
It's okay if you wanna check on her.
I can get to the Owl House on my own.
Do you think they were arrested?
Looks like I'm... due for a growth spurt soon... heh, heh.
There!
All done!
Thanks Eda, but I just want things to be normal right now.
Uh, no thanks.
I'm... I'm good.
Uh, no.
Listen, it's okay.
I just uh need some alone time.
Your Titan... commands it?
Hey, I know you!
Shouldn't you be like kissing the Emperor's butt right now?
I hear that.
I point, you drive.
You know, Steve, I always wanted to have power and command respect and fear!
So, now that I kinda have all that, why does my stomach feel all... ugh?
I don't want people to see me as a big scary monster anymore.
It's okay, it's okay!
He's not a scout anymore!
Did I read that right?
Stop!
I'm still KING, KING!
Isn't this how you acted with the Emperor?
I'm sensing a little bit of a pattern with you.
And your memories got all scramjambled.
You're enjoying this, aren't you, Blight brother?
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Aw, weak.
Your dad's here.
What are you doing?
I'm never letting you go!
You're never returning to the human realm!
Yes I do!
Really?
You're a traitor.
King want a cracker!
Hey, that's mine, you feather duster!
Oof.
Hey, King want a cracker!
Ooh!
Huh?
Is that the Emperor's sigil?
This ship belongs to the Emperor?
Oh, boy.
I gotta tell Luz.
Ah, it's dark now.
No, I'm not.
Wait, what is that?
Crackers.
I'm not reading this.
Ugh, fine.
Is that a six-footed pig or a floating appendage?
Why, no!
It's Gus the Illusion Master.
Please leave a message.
Don't forget this.
glove stained with Titan blood.
Did it?
That looks real different from the old door!
Don't forget to mention me!
Do you think she's safe?
Did you talk to your mom?
Did you mention me?
I can't wait to eat HUMAN snacks!
