[deep voice]
Who dares intrude upon I, [normal voice]
the king of demons?
[squeaks a rubber ducky]
[struggles to free himself]
I don't know who your little guy is!
Eda, who is this monster?
Hooray!
Please don't encourage her!
[is dropped]
Nyeh!
[picks up his rubber duck]
Soon, Mr.
Ducky, we shall drink the fear of those who mocked us.
[follows Eda]
Try to catch me when I'm covered in grease.
I'm a squirmy little fella.
Aah!
[falls off of Luz's head]
You and I will sneak up to the top of the tower, where they're holding my crown.
It's hideous.
[grunting as he climbs up Luz and into the window]
Ha-ha!
Cat's don't do that.
Not yet, you're not.
My crown!
It's close!
I can sense its power!
[runs up to the door and fiddles with the doorknob that's as big as he is]
[grunts]
Oh, yeah.
My crown!
[jumps in place before taking the crown from Luz and placing it on his head]
Yes.
Yes!
I can feel my powers returning!
You, there.
Nightmare critter.
[points to a stuffed rabbit with one button eye falling out of a box]
I shall call you Francois, and you shall be a minion in my army of darkness.
Ha-ha!
[picks up the rabbit]
Weh?
My power!
Ow, my bones!
[stands and runs to join Eda]
If you think this guy is bad, you shoulda seen her last boyfriend!
[whimpers and hides his face in Eda's chest]
That was actually one of her better breakups.
[accepts the crown and places it on his head]
This shall suffice.
You there, plant!
You are now under my command.
[he points to something and walks off screen.
[pulling at Eda's dress]
Let her stay!
[whispers]
She can make us snacks.
Too tight!
Too tight!
[clears his throat, steps into view while holding Francois]
Your sleep cocoon looks fluffy.
[laying on Luz's stomach]
Hey!
Less ready, more scratchy!
[bites the pamphlet]
Nyah!
Is it my birthday?
Ooo, gimme gimme gimme!
[pulls out a teddy bear]
Yes!
Another worthy addition to my army of terror!
Truly horrifying!
Yeah!
This bear could be our new Luz.
[throws New Guy]
You're unbearable!
[opens back door]
Did someone say boot camp?
I agree to run it.
We'll rise at dawn!
You'll carry me on your back as I yell hateful things about your performance!
I am not adorable!
[stomps]
This is ludicrous!
I once led armies.
I can lead a dang boot camp!
But I have no recruits.
[looks at New Guy and Francois]
Or do I?
Ugh, no!
You are too desperate!
[goes inside, returns with all his toys]
Role call!
[says their names as he puts them down]
New Guy, Aloysius Turtle, Chip, Beefy Bob, Francois.
[pause, picks up Francois]
Oh, you're perfect already!
As for the rest of you, I'm only saying this once so listen up!
Huh it's no fun if they don't tremble.
Ohh okay, alright.
[looks between the vegetables and his toys]
Yep, an idea is happening!
Military discipline, cooking!
Ha, I truly am a demon for all seasons!
[pours the potion from earlier on his toys, except Francois]
Just a dash of Eda's secret sauce and I'm the creator of life!
Yes, yes, yes!
My loyal recruits!
Welcome to boot camp!
You sure need it.
Look at you: raggedy, pathetic, chewed on, you got a button hangin' off of your eye.
Pathetic!
But I'll mold you worms into...
slightly...
better kinds of worms.
Your first mission: gimme snacks!
Your commander is hungry, so pick it up!
[smacks New Guy]
Hey, Private Dingdong, snacks are that-a-way!
You better shape up recruit, you're in my boot camp now.
Yep, keep 'em coming.
[to Aloysius Turtle]
And don't forget the pretzels this time.
[takes bag of chips and opens it]
Running a boot camp is tough work, but as my second-in-command, you deserve this.
Hey, hey!
Private New Guy!
You're not privy to snacking privileges, back away!
[yawns]
Leading this boot camp has tuckered a little guy out, so Sergeant King signing off.
[opens eyes]
Excuse me?
Could you maybe turn down those eyeballs?
Trying to sleep.
[hugs Francois]
[from inside]
Hey!
How dare you mutiny!
Unhand your commander right now!
[is thrown through a window with Francois]
I gave you life, I can take it away!
[rolls over, stands]
Hooty, Hooty!
Great news, buddy, you can be in the boot camp!
First task: destroy the boot camp.
What?
But you begged to join!
[rages]
Ugh!
What do you want?
Hmm...
[holds up piece of chalk]
This day shall live in infamy.
Private Hooty, today when the felt flew you showed grit and determination that were instrumental in securing our victory.
May I just say, it has been an honor, to be your commander.
Private, [hugs Hooty]
our hearts have been touched by fire, and-
Um, excuse me?
We're having a moment here!
[walks away]
Ugh, moment ruined.
Weh?
[peeks into the room]
[also hugs Eda]
King demands huggies too!
[wakes up]
Cape?
I thought you were making cake!
I, uh...
anyway!
If there's no cake, then I have to get to work!
[runs off]
Would you look at us two, being all generous to that kid.
You know what, when she first got here, I thought we were gonna eat her.
But now I only think of that, like, sometimes.
Wait!
[pushes a cake into the living room]
Wait for me!
You're not the only one who knows dark magic!
[holds up cake mix box]
Now stop gawking and load me in!
Gentle!
[gasps]
The cake is me!
[looks around]
Hey, um, where's Eda?
Show me the picture.
[peeking over the top of the book]
Show me the picture!
[Luz does]
Hah!
I can draw better than that.
You know, they once called me the King of Artists.
Doesn't matter.
What's important is that my followers would leave me offerings in fear of me!
[grabs the book]
You shall not shan't doeth no more harm, Azura callethed out...
[continues reading]
Hecate could only screech, screech as did she, for the screeching did worseneth.
Weh?
Destiny?
Feh!
I'm not paying for--
Are you bestowing gifts upon me?
Yes!
I accept your offering!
The King of Demons is back!
Cupcakes in my tummy-tum makes the King say yummy-yum!
[eats a cupcake in one bite]
Hmm...
Nope!
[steals a cupcake off the other baker's tray and runs]
Oh, hey, Luz!
Look at all those offerings-- [trips on his scarf]
Wah!
[while scratching his face with his hind leg]
I'm not a pet!
[picking up the ruined cupcake]
Good night, sweet child.
Do it, Luz!
For my honor!
[eating his cupcake]
Mmm?
Oh, yeah.
Things that are free ?
People are giving offerings to me!
[reaches Willow and Gus]
I love offerings!
What did I miss?
Weh?
This I gotta see!
Hey!
You root for Luz or nobody!
Mmm?
I'm okay!
Luz!
Help me!
My offerings!
Hey, wait for me!
[follows her]
Luz!
You left me!
Nah.
That stuff just weighed me down.
But I have something for you, Luz.
And it's the best thing, because it's free, comes from my heart, and I always have more than I need.
Ugh!
[reaches behind him]
Tote bags!
[puts it on Luz's arm and hops in it as she stands]
And they have so many uses!
Away, fair chariot!
Away!
You very much don't!
You think that's impressive?
Check this out!
Two warriors battling to the death!
Senseless violence.
Yes, attack!
DEATH IS YOUR GOD!
Hah!
What possible regrets could come from the internet?
Did you know that the Earth is actually flat?
Ah, a severed hand!
Perfect response.
Nah, she'd be freaked out by our world anyway.
So actually, by keeping the truth from her, you're doing her a favor!
Always trust a shoulder demon!
I FORGE MY OWN PATH!
What a dum-dum.
Ugh.
Who has the energy?
Why am I doing this?
I don't even wear clothes!
And Gus asked me to co-emcee the fight!
We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath!
A great joke, Luz!
Uh, maybe you were too hard on her.
She's saved you from multiple monsters, remember?
Girl, you can pull off anything!
Up top!
[they high-five]
We're style geniuses!
Why so twitchy, witchy?
Trying to remember if I've ever seen you this nervous before.
Wow, Gus is really good at this.
They're hanging on his every word!
Whoo, I, uh, hope my material's up to snuff.
Whoah!
What do you think will go better with the youths, close-up magic or impressions?
Aaahh!
Hel-LO, Hexside!
So...
Oh, oh gosh.
Um...
whoooo.
Wow, these lights are warm.
Observe!
Luz, is um...
she's down there, all right.
And, uh, yes she is!
There she goes!
Folks, she's battling the thing, and uh...
You will clap for me!
Please?
Nothing!
Leave me be!
[lays down]
Well if that's the rule...
Oh, how can this be?
I get stage fright!
The king of demons!
I know, I know.
Imagine everyone in their underwear.
I dunno.
I always do that.
[chuckle]
I am a little weirdo.
Gimme!
[to himself]
King of Demons, you got this.
[to crowd]
Well, folks, looks like our show literally just took off!
Weh?
Uh, took off just like your local sports team would take off when they're about to make a goal?
Yeah, that's right, so let's follow them and see what happens next.
And there you have it, folks.
A happy ending for this year's Grom.
Let's give a big hand to our Grom queens, Luz and Amity!
Of course I did it!
I'm the King of Demons and I've never had stage fright in my life!
THEY LOVE ME!
NOW I AM KING AND QUEEN!
Best of both things!
Your curse is returning!
[follows her]
I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down!
I know the pain.
[from the bench]
Yeah, busy playing Hexes Hold'em.
She's obsessed with it.
You're playing it right now!
Like me!
Whoa!
Jelly beans!
[laughs]
He wants to be called that.
Really?
Now?
Oof.
That was painful to watch.
I don't look good in clothes.
I'm all-natural.
Eda, do something!
King?
Who's King?
I go by Little Bone Boy now.
You promise?
[chuckles]
Okay, okay.
[kicks off the ankle chain]
I'll grab you the elixir and then we can bust out of here.
Heh?
[throws hat on counter]
Just because I have a model's body doesn't mean you can use me like this.
Eda, quick!
I can't believe they animated a whole house.
[walking away]
Aw, come on, Luz.
[unfurls a towel]
It's not every day you get to go to the dump and pick apart a garbage carcass.
[giggles]
[sighs]
[struggles to free himself]
Lose apprentice, gain garbage eggs.
Fair trade.
If you don't teach Luz right, you will.
And that's when I come in, make her my apprentice.
Hey, that only happened once!
I'd teach her about demons.
How to identify them, talk to 'em, raise an army with them and tear apart the world!
You think you're so smart!
Well, [hops off the trash he's sitting on toward Eda]
why don't we make a little bet where I can prove that I'd make a better teacher.
I like those odds.
Well, when you lose, you'll have to...
wear a shame hat and sleep in a shack and never come into the Owl House again!
[squeaks as he stamps his paw to a page]
Who's a good Prince, Jr.
Who's a good guy?
It's called positive reinforcement, Eda.
And it works wonders.
Ha ha!
See?
Now watch this.
Prince, Jr.
Attack Eda!
Knock over her drink!
Mess up her hair!
Well, I haven't seen your student in forever.
For all we know, she's not even loyal to you anymore.
Roll over!
Yes!
Heel!
Yes, yes!
So, did you find your runaway student?
By your expression, I can tell Luz has gone and found herself someplace else to learn.
Which means I have won!
Oh, Eda.
Don't say that.
At least you have this!
[He pulls out a shame cone and cackles.
[laughing as Eda enters the shack attached to the Owl House]
I am so funny!
Ah, well, Prince, Jr.
training complete.
Go forth!
Make the world tremble at your feet-- or worm stubs.
Go forth?
[chuckles]
Right.
Help me, help me, help me!
Yes, yes!
[squeals]
Please help me!
You can call me Mr.
Wiggles!
[whimpers]
Baby boy!
I have no son.
Eat salt!
[dances]
Yes, I did it!
I'm amazing!
Ahh!
[chuckles]
You helped too.
You are a good teacher.
Luz, you're getting all swoony again.
Rivals are meant to be annihilated not befriended.
Now keep reading.
I've been sucked into your awful fandom.
The book has come to life!
Burn it!
[rubbing his paws together]
Fresh meat.
There's a note.
[grabs it]
Take care of my child till morning.
Yi Yi.
You will be handsomely rewarded.
X-O-X-O-X-O-X.
Bat Queen.
Good thinking.
Oh, boy.
It's been hours.
How can it keep screaming?
No amount of snails is worth this torture.
[falls to the floor]
Make it stop.
Uh, for, for the money?
What silences children?
What if we invent a TV network for ages six to 11--
[gasps]
I miss my babies.
[hugs Eda]
That's not a thing anyone ever wants.
Weh!
[falls off the table]
Stupid flag!
You have venom?
Quick, Luz, start melting faces!
[grabs her hood]
No, I'll show you what to do.
[grunts, jumps onto the table]
You will tremble before me!
Weh!
[shoves her face]
[frees himself]
You couldn't afford me, sister!
That's the incorrect reaction!
What does Luz know about problems anyway?
All she has is dumb teen drama!
She doesn't understand how hard some of us have it.
Well, I don't know if you realized, but I'm not a baby!
My life is a living nightmare!
Fight to the death!
[to Luz]
Are you sure you don't shoot venom?
[in Luz's body]
Yeah, it is.
I'm the human now.
Bow before my massive, meaty hands!
I've got some...
very confusing emotions right now.
Won't be me.
Life as a teen is a tyrant's dream!
[to Luz]
By the end of the day, I'll be ruling over your feeble demographic.
My life's not a joke!
[to Luz]
But yours is.
[pokes Luz's nose]
Bap.
[laughs and runs away]
Weh!
Not so high and mighty anymore.
[throws it on the ground]
I feel so alive!
[yelps]
[backing away]
Oh, no!
[shouts and ducks]
The flag, it seeks revenge.
Teenagers.
I'll show Luz how to rule over these doofuses.
[enters]
Greetings!
Er...
[stands up]
Greetings!
Bow before your king of humans.
Goody Two-Shoes, huh?
Hey, impressionable youths!
Under my command, you could learn how to do some real damage.
Nyeh!
All hail, your new teen king.
Who wants to revolt with me today?
All right, you acne-encrusted hormone buckets.
Let's go let out some teen angst!
Guys, be quiet.
[laughs]
I don't know what Luz is talking about.
This life is a breeze.
[gasps]
Ooh, I'm so scared.
[chuckles]
She still thinks she has power over you guys.
Guys?
Meh.
Don't baby me!
[walks up to Boscha]
Boscha, I accept your strange teenaged, coming-of-age challenge thing.
[gulps]
Let's go!
Worm minion, I said go!
Stop!
I said stop!
[screaming]
This is how the cool kids ride.
Super backwards.
On purpose.
Yes!
Say bye-bye to your popularity, Boscha.
[falls off the rat worm]
Weh!
Luz was right.
I can't handle the complexities of teenage life.
I just want my body back.
Huh?
No, wait!
I am a little baby!
[runs]
Lady, I just want my body back.
Dang!
I forgot about them.
My body!
My glorious little body!
Are they gonna be okay?
Luz...
[climbs onto table]
Nyeh!
You've been talking to them all morning.
Don't forget about the Luz and King comedy hour!
This week I've been working with props!
[turns around to show a cardboard tube on his nose]
Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose!
Will I ever eat again?
[slams a piece of bread on his face]
Looks like I'm toast!
Why don't you bake me?
[sigh]
Hee hee, oh you!
[scrambles over to the door]
You...
you really think she's coming back this time?
The King of Demons-- [tosses bread and tube off]
The King of Demons misses nobody!
I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now!
Wha!
You're back!
[climbs up on Luz's head]
I didn't miss you at all.
That sounds like a crumby situation.
That's my kinda day!
Ooh, and destroying his life!
That was the best part!
You should really put a lock on your closet.
That's me!
I love crime!
Ooh, what's that?
[runs up to prize booth]
Some kind of deadly string weapon.
Is that a type of deadly weapon?
Ooh!
That's a safer way than becoming blood brothers!
Luz, we must have those bracelets!
[tugging cuff on Luz's shorts]
Beat up the man and steal his things for me.
Oh, okay.
Ahem.
Nyeh!
[knocks Gus's finger away]
Um, sure.
Whatever you want, Luz.
[screams, grunts]
Curse these stubby legs!
[looks at poster, sighs]
Weh?
Who said that?
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
It's almost so...
That's what I was gonna say.
Wow!
You really are psychic.
[sighs]
You got my number, Obvioso.
Today was supposed to be about me and Luz, see?
But now she's distracted by her cool new school friends.
I'd say that sounds illegal.
I would also say go on.
Holy bones!
You poofed it.
Call the cops!
This guy's crazy!
Whoa!
You even know their names.
Guess there's no use arguing with a fortune-teller.
Thanks, Obvioso.
[walks away]
Hey.
Sidenote: in the future, do I ever find love?
[laughs, leaves again]
Hmm, maybe I should think about this first.
Hey, it's okay.
[grabs Luz's hand]
Let's go back to the games and win those bracelets.
Games!
Games!
But today was me and Luz's day.
[grunts]
The King of Demons misses nobody.
I demand you put me down!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Actually, Luz.
There's something I gotta tell you.
Uh...
[whisper]
Willow and Gus will be okay for a little while, right?
Nothing.
Now let's go!
[chuckles]
Yes!
Ha ha!
[squeals]
Yes, Luz.
I want the bracelets.
It's kind of important to me, okay?
Count faster.
Yes.
Yes!
Now Luz and I will share a bond as mighty as these trinkets!
[laughs]
Heya, Luz.
Good news.
I got the bracelets.
Huh?
[yelps]
Y-you weren't supposed to shrink.
You, you were supposed to disappear.
Ooh, no.
Wait.
No, no, no.
Luz, I can explain.
I wanted to win the bracelets and there was this psychic, see?
[holds out bottle]
No, wait I-I-I gotta explain.
I was just trying to...
I was just trying to solve my problems.
Wait, I can fix it.
Obvioso showed me how.
Behold.
[taps cheeks several times]
Why isn't this working?
Tapping my cheeks is supposed to turn us normal.
The psychic told me.
You fiend.
When Obvioso finds out you stole his mustache...
Oh...
Ah, King, you idiot.
This is all your fault.
[pulls out friendship bracelets]
But I think I know how to fix it.
Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you.
And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends.
I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school.
I just...
wanna be around you!
Alright.
I only have one shot.
[throws friendship bracelets]
Nyah!
Gus, Willow, you're okay!
[takes them]
It's...
it's okay.
Because now there's a piece for everybody.
[holds two out to Willow and Gus]
If you'll accept it, that is?
I'm sorry, Luz.
Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody.
[giggles]
Hey, we still have a few hours of carnival left.
Wanna hit those bumper carcasses?
[laughs]
Yes!
Bread puns.
Bread puns forever.
Ooh!
Fight, fight, fight!
Aw, look what you did.
I'm gonna go rub it in.
Nyeh!
[laughs, leaves]
Dream on!
[pops out of Luz's backpack]
Boop!
[jumps to the ground]
You're a free ride to the best buffet in town!
Nyah!
[hops into trash can, comes out with a half-eaten donut]
The trash cans here are filled with half-eaten gold!
Have a wonderful school day, person-I-don't-know!
[climbs out of a trash can]
Nyah.
Uh, right!
I don't know you!
Time to scrounge through the trash- [yelps]
Substitute?
I ain't no desk jockey.
Nyah!
[hops onto desk]
Can it, Fangs!
You don't know diddly dang about squiddly squat!
Obedience?
Well, what is a teacher if not an authority figure?
A king of children, if you will.
[runs to front of the room]
Yes!
I am your teacher!
You may call me Mr.
King!
Assume a coefficient of ten, carry the two, solve for Y, and that is the way to steal a pie from a windowsill!
[he has drawn himself stealing pie on the chalkboard]
Also you can eat trash.
[pulls out a slice of pizza]
And now, for my next lesson--
Seriously?
It's not even fifth period yet.
Excuse me!
Could you keep it down?
King's trying to mold young minds here!
I can see that I'm interrupting, so I'm just gonna...
[screams and runs away]
Alright.
Read chapters three to five on the right way to scratch yourself in public.
Spoiler alert: There's no wrong way!
[sighs]
Days like these make being a teacher all worth it.
Weh?
Maybe not, but I care about these kids, [tosses coffee in Principal Bump's face]
and nothing can change that.
[grunting, tears the sock into pieces, then punches the remnants]
Where are you now, ducky sock?
Oh, yeah.
[grunting, climbs up a table]
Human Luz, you've been so obsessed with witchcraft that you haven't learned anything about my kind.
Prepare yourself for...
[rips off a curtain to reveal a corkboard of photos of various demons; puts on a hat and spins the cord on top of it]
Demons 101.
Demons like me are grim tricksters of the twilight, creatures of sulfur and bone.
[sighs]
And cute little paws.
True.
We live only to create chaos and misery.
Our only weaknesses are purified water and passive-aggressive comments.
Sometimes.
Even demons have inner demons.
[tears off one of the pictures to reveal a snarling demon]
The most powerful demon of all is the Snaggleback.
He's a--
Luz, pay attention.
This information could save your life someday.
Uh-oh.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Hey, wait.
Look, now we're boo-boo buddies.
It's like a rainbow but looking at it turns you inside out.
And if the rain doesn't get you, the Snaggleback will.
[opens a book, showing Snaggleback images]
They wander the rain, feeding on boiled tourists.
I think it's 'cause she gets distracted by shiny objects.
Uh-oh.
Moving a little slow.
Age finally catching up to ya?
[screams as Eda hoods his head with the hat]
Darkness!
But don't you wanna finish our lesson?
I was gonna let you scratch a demon's tummy.
Yawn!
Who needs another boring spell lesson when you could be learning all the fun ways a demon could kill you.
[holds up a drawing of a demon with giant teeth]
Look how teethy.
Bite, bite.
Welp, looks like one more spell killed Eda.
Bap!
[slaps Eda's face]
Yep.
She's out.
Bap!
[slaps Eda's face, laughs]
Just making sure.
Boiling rains, remember?
Remember when her head got cut off last week?
That woman can survive anything.
She's probably just tired from staying up all night chasing shrews and voles.
Should I bap her again?
[smacks Eda again]
Bap!
[cackles as he runs off]
Yeah, yeah.
[puts his notepad over Luz's phone]
Hey, you know what's really cryptish?
Let me tell you about the most spine-chilling demon.
[lifts up notepad to show a fish-like demon]
Smoochy-pie the Sweetie Baby!
He's...
Well, he's a lot more threatening than his name implies.
Why do you want to learn magic so bad, anyway?
[sighs]
If I help you learn that spell, could we finish our lesson?
Well, she said witches used to do magic differently, so there has to be a way, right?
[draws something and shows it to Luz]
And I have a theory.
Every day I notice Eda sneaking drinks of this special elixir, see?
Then she always gets a boost of energy, see?
I think that's where she gets her powers.
And I know where to get some.
King.
I'm King.
Now where could it be...
[gasps]
Nice try.
An elixir a day.
Cryptic.
[rips off the tag]
Nyeh.
Nah.
Got it!
Who even needs a light spell when we have tons of lamps?
[groans]
Hooty controls the house lights.
He probably just fell asleep.
Oh, my gosh.
The Snaggleback!
It feeds during the rains.
It must have stumbled across our house and seen us inside.
[squealing]
Because this could be a lesson.
This would be a great way for you to see a wild demon up close and personal.
What if Eda gets eaten?
She's upstairs and defenseless because you knocked her out.
Weh!
She got snaggle-backed.
I'll go get my demon book.
Wait, wait.
First edition or second?
[gasps]
Luz?
[drops the books]
The Snaggleback got her.
You craven beast.
Give me back my boo-boo buddy.
Luz?
There's nowhere for you to run!
[moves the clothes aside]
Snaggleback?
Wow.
You are a lot shorter in person.
Then why did you break down our door and take Luz?
That's not cool, man.
Bad Snaggleback!
Huh?
Well, then what...
[yells, then whimpers]
Oh, my.
[yelps]
Stay back.
Hey, hey.
I am the king of demons, okay?
And as such, I demand you to barf my friends back up.
Luz?
Where did you go?
What's that?
[takes it and reads it]
Keeps the curse at bay.
[gasps, pulls out the tag in his collar and puts them together]
An elixir a day, keeps the curse at bay.
I was wrong the whole time.
That's no Snaggleback.
That creature is...
Don't you see?
The elixir I gave you doesn't give Eda powers.
It prevents her from turning into that thing.
She's turned into a nightmare and it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry, Luz.
I-I just wanted you to be into demons like you're into magic.
I don't have many friends, and no one even pays that much attention to me.
I thought maybe if I taught you, finally someone would care about creatures like me.
Huh?
Let's see.
[draws on the leaves]
She was bigger, covered in feathers, and had giant black eyes.
Demons with black eyes are usually sensitive to light.
[looks at Luz's phone]
That's it.
Light!
Luz, use your human wonder rectangle.
Then...
what about that light spell?
[looks at Luz's phone]
What?
Where?
Shh!
We're not going to stop anything with something that small.
What do we do now?
[hums]
I'm kind of over that nickname.
But okay.
[fist bumps her]
[holding the pen]
Oh, what lovely thing do we have here?
It's just so dang shiny.
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.
[walking over]
Actually, we found an extra one in your closet.
Shh!
[whispering]
Over there.
I don't know, but she did it all on her own.
Hey, I, uh, kind of messed a bunch of things up back there.
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Oh, you.
That voice.
That horrific voice!
Oh, yeah.
[shows his drawing]
This will make a great addition to my demon book.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to edit that.
What?
[tries to escape as she begins]
What is happening?
Sleep spell...
[yawns]
Yeah, who cares?
I think not!
[bursts through Illusion Gus's chest]
If you're handing out attention, I deserve it.
Nyeh!
You got nothing.
No one could turn down an interview with someone this pretty!
[drops mirror]
Weh?
Weh?
My decisiveness.
W-wa-Wait, I changed my mind!
No it wasn't!
If you want noise, I'll give you noise!
Hooty?
I'm gonna bake that kid into a pie!
Ugh.
Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here?
[He throws a bag of onion rings from Eda's hair, then pulls out a rat]
Get your own scalp, buddy.
This one’s taken.
[throws the rat]
Hard pass.
[next to a scoreboard, dressed as a cheerleader]
Yes!
Now I’ll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.
Point goes to Lilith.
We’re at a tie here, folks.
Ha ha!
Game over!
Team Owl House rules supreme!
[chuckles]
You’re— You’re not gonna show this to anyone, right?
[snoring]
[snoring]
I am not your cutie-pie!
[sighs]
I know.
[laughs]
What?
But I just found the perfect spot.
Why do I have to go?
[throws a short tantrum before stomping out the door]
Huh!
Let's get this over with.
Hey, it's rude to stare.
[shrugs]
Haven't seen any others.
Yeah.
Did Azura's path to greatness involve her delivering boil cream?
[takes a potion labeled Boil B' Gone from the sack and holds it up]
Good luck.
The Boiling Isles is nothing but a cesspool of despair.
[sighs]
I know I've had enough delight for one day.
Sorry to break it to you, Luz, but no one here is that well-dressed.
Big houses always belong to big whackjobs.
Let's kick the package inside and get outta here.
Hey, wait.
[runs after Luz, yelping when the doors slam behind him]
Weh!
Weird old man in jim-jams.
[grabbing Luz's leg]
Let's scram!
[climbs up to Luz's shoulder]
Wizards are just old people with glitter in their pockets.
I don't trust him.
Where?
[munching, holds up an empty plate]
You should run a small business of more scones into my mouth.
[chuckles]
Yes!
[walking past Luz with the bag of potions]
Neat story, awesome.
Anyway, your food is gone and we are, too.
[kneading Luz's sleeping bag, yawns and lies down]
Huh?
What?
Eda, tell Luz how dumb wizards are.
Your wizard client told Luz...
[laughs]
she was a-- [laughing]
was a Chosen One!
[laughing]
He even gave her a map.
Finally!
All that mean-spirited laughter made me sleepy.
Yes.
Now go away.
Less talky, more nappy.
[sniffing]
This is where we met the scones.
I mean, the wizard.
Whoa!
It wasn't like this before.
[sniffing]
Can't mistake her smell.
Like lemons and young, naïve confidence.
[gasps]
The cat man melted!
So, what do we do?
Yeah, and we're flying directly into his trap.
Hurray.
I didn't have to be a part of this!
I am not a-- [muffled grunt]
And very stinky.
Yeah.
[leans against Luz]
The Boiling Isles, born from the flesh and bones of a fallen Titan.
This original magic was so potent, all life on the Isles evolved to wield magic too.
For years, we explored those power freely.
Until, a mysterious witch appeared who declared that he, and he alone, could speak to the island.
He said that we were using magic all wrong.
His teachings took hold, his strength grew, and he became...
Emperor Belos.
Belos said that mixing magic was wrong, that only he had that right.
So he created the coven system.
And there, our knowledge was restricted, and our potential sealed away.
Those who resist are called wild witches, and they face harsh punishment.
Emperor Belos has since retreated into his castle.
There are whispers that say he's planning something big.
I wonder if catching Eda was part of his big plan.
What do you think, Luz?
Luz?
Luz, what are you doing?
Haven't you been listening to me?
He's the Emperor!
He's the most powerful witch alive!
But she's in her Owl Beast form!
How will she even recognize you?
Well then, I'm going too.
Me and Eda don't always see eye to eye, but I do consider her family.
I want her back as much as you do.
Nyeh!
Petrification is only done to the worst criminals, and once the spell is complete, it can't be reversed.
Luz, calm down.
We need to think about saving Eda first!
There's not gonna be a new statue going up today.
Right, Luz?
Luz?
Weh.
Let me go!
Luz!
[follows them through the door]
Luz, watch out!
[is pulled to the ground by vines]
Weh?
Hey Luz, You...
eed a minute?
[screams as he also gets taken by a tendril]
[jumps between Eda and Lilith]
No, don't!
She was trying to help.
She even betrayed the Emperor for you!
Wh-- what do we do?
