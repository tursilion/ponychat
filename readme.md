(n/a)

This is a simple (well, not really) text parsing script that does a really loose interpretation of Markov Chains to generate strings of text. Ultimately, it reads in multiple text files and creates a conversation between the two characters, as well as loading images to go with it.

It can also generate a monologue from a single character, and the intent is someday it'll be possible to chat with it, but I've been lazy at working out how that works.

It started out with a bunch of pony characters, then I added a bunch of other cartoons. The text files still contain some errors - some are better than others. I've been editting them to simplify punctuation and clean up typos, and try to make them more consistent between each other (which helps).

Anyway, this is completely unsupported.
