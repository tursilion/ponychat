Gildersnake: Foolish child! I could swallow you whole! [hisses]

Azura: Do not underestimate me, Gildersnake, for I am the Good Witch Azura, warrior of peace! [poses as wind blows her hair before dropping into a battle stance and holding her staff like a bazooka] Now eat this, sucka! [fires off staff]

Gildersnake: [while being shot] No! My only weakness: dying! [collapses]

[Cuts to a doll of Azura and a green snake being held.]

Luz: And that's the end.

Camila: The end of what?

Luz: My book report. [the snake hisses and bites the doll] I think I knocked it out of the park.

Principal Hal: Your book report is why you're in here.

[He gestures to the door, through which we can see two students running by screaming, snakes biting their heads.]

Luz: Oh. That's where the backup snakes were.

Camila: And what were you going to do with this? [holds up several firecrackers tied together]

Luz: That was for the Act Three closer.

Camila: Mija, I love your creativity, but it's gotten out of hand. Do you remember why you were in the principal's office the last three times?

[Cut to Luz on stage at an audition for Romeo and Juliet, holding a spork.]

Luz: O happy dagger, give me death!

[Luz stabs the spork into her torso before tearing her dress, making several links of sausages fall out. Everyone else on stage screams and runs. Cut to Luz sewing a pigeon head onto a squirrel's body, on a platform labelled "baby griffin".]

Luz: Now for the final anatomically correct touch, spider breath.

[She opens the model's beak. Many spiders come out, crawling over her and the table. People scream in terror, throwing objects everywhere. Cut to cheerleading tryouts, where a girl does a successful backflip. Every other student applauds.]

Luz: You think that's an impressive trick? [throws her pom-poms to the side] Take a look at this. [turns around to reveal she flipped her eyelids inside out] Bleep, bloop, bleep!

[Everyone else screams and runs, and it sounds like at least one person is gagging. Cut back to Principal Hal's office.]

Camila: We all love that you express yourself, but if you can't learn to separate fantasy from reality, you may need to spend the summer here.

[She holds out a pamphlet for Reality Check Summer Camp. Luz takes it reluctantly.]

Luz: Don't worry, Mom. I won't let you down. [stands up triumphantly] No more weirdness!

[The snake in Luz's hand suddenly jumps out and bites the principal. He falls to the ground with a yell while the snake hisses.]

Luz: That doesn't count, right?

[Cut to Luz, who is standing disappointedly in front of her house.]

Camila: [comes out of the house] Oh! Oh, my baby! [hugs Luz] Now, don't worry. Summer camp is only going to be for three months. You'll be so busy balancing checkbooks and learning to... appreciate public radio, the time will fly by!

Luz: But I don't like any of that stuff. I like editing anime clips to music and- and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories.

Camila: Mija, your fantasy world is holding you back. Do you have any friends? Real ones, not imagined or drawn or reptilian?

[Luz drops her book, disappointed. She walks slowly over to the trash bin.]

Camila: Summer camp is a chance to make some friends, but you have to try. Can you do that?

Luz: Yes, Mom.

[Luz puts her book, The Good Witch Azura, into the trash bin. Camila's phone vibrates in her purse.]

Camila: Oh. I gotta go to work. [kisses Luz's forehead] Your bus is coming soon. Text me when you get there. Cuídate mucho, mija. ¡Qué te vaya bien! [walks away]

Luz: Bye, Mom. [watches her leave, then gasps and rummages through the bin] Where is it? Where is it?

Owlbert: [hoots]

[Luz looks up and sees Owlbert, her book sticking out of the bag in his beak. He turns and flies away.]

Luz: Tiny trash thief!!

[Luz chases Owlbert. She pauses when the reach a decrepit abandoned house, but Owlbert continues right inside. Luz stares at the house.]

Luz: [growls]

[Steeling her nerves, Luz runs inside. The front door slams shut behind her, and the entire inside glows, visible through the windows and the holes in the roof.]

[Cut to the inside of a tent, where a door unfolds in three parts before opening. Owlbert hops through it, and a second later, Luz follows.]

Luz: Stop adorably hopping away, you-- Huh? [looks around the tent, which is full of old odds and ends] Whoa. I thought I had a lot of weird stuff. [grabs a creepy-looking doll] But this? This is impressive.

Eda: [offscreen] Finally, you're back.

[Luz makes a noise and drops to the ground. She peeks back up and walks forward, moving the flap of the tent aside to see the back of a woman.]

Eda: Now let's see what we've got here.

[Owlbert lands on top of Eda's staff. She turns him around, and he becomes a wooden fixture of the staff.]

Luz: [gasps]

Eda: [takes out a phone from the bag] Garbage. [takes out a ring] Garbage. [takes out a golden shining chalice] Garbage. [gasps] Now, this... [takes out a pair of joke glasses with eyes on springs and puts them on] This will make me rich. [takes out Luz's book] And this... Oh, this will make good kindling. [holds the book with candle]

Luz: [gasps; runs out of the tent and grabs her book back] Excuse me, sorry, it's mine, thank you.

[Luz runs back into the tent and heads for the door. It folds up before she can walk through it and disappears. Camera zooms out to show Eda holding a key with an eye on it, the same eye that was on the door]

Eda: [takes off the glasses] You're not going anywhere.

Luz: Wah-ah!

[She shoves Azura into her messenger bag and ducks out the back of the tent. She runs, and skids to a stop mere inches away from falling off a cliff. She's clearly no longer on earth, the town before her being made up of far too many arms and teeth. A dragon flies by and is caught by one of said arms. Cut to denizens of the town going about their days: a cloaked figure holding an ice cream cone which eats someone, the legs of what appear to be a giant chicken, a centipede-looking thing opening its mouth to let a winged creature fly out. The latter two kiss before going their separate ways. Cut back to Luz.]

Luz: [backing away from the cliff] Oh, no, no, no, no! What's going on? [shrieks as a fairy approaches her] Oh, hello, little fairy. Are you going to tell me this is all a fantastical dream?

Fairy: Give me your skin!

Luz: [screams, slaps the fairy into the ground] Where am I? Did I die? Am I in the bad place?

Eda: [touches her shoulder] You wish.

Luz: [sits down on a stool] I'm so sorry! I just wanted my book! If you're gonna eat my skin, [offers her arm and closes her eyes] just make it quick! Just do it now!

Eda: Eat you? Why would I eat... a potential customer?

Luz: [opens her eyes]

Eda: Can I offer you a human foot filled with holes? [holds up a green Croc, then puts it aside and grabs a stick of men's deodorant] A bar of green human candy? Oh, oh! How about this black shadow box that reflects only sadness? [holds a portable tv up to Luz]

Luz: [looks at Eda and laughs] That's not all it can do. Here, let me see it.

[Luz takes the tv and grabs two batteries from a dish labelled "Human candy! (????)" She puts the batteries in and presses the power button. A jazzercise video start playing with loud music.]

Luz: Voilà!

[Several customers and vendors stop at the noise.]

Monster #1: Huh?

Monster #2: What's that?

Monster #3: The sound-- it's so alluring.

[Several monsters are now crowded around the tv.]

Monster #1: [holding up green bills] I'll pay 40 snails for the screaming box!

Monster #2: I'll give you a hundred!

Monster #3: Can I eat the tiny person inside?

[all bidding]

Eda: [looks at Luz] What did you say your name was?

Luz: I'm Luz. Luz Noceda.

Eda: [taking people's money] Well, Luz, that was pretty clever... for a human.

Luz: That's kind of a weird thing for another human to say.

Eda: Oh, dear child, [take off bandana to reveal pointed ears] I'm not like you. [climbs onto the table] I'm Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles!

Luz: A witch?

Eda: I am a respected, feared--

Guard #1: Busted! [breaks the tv]

Monster: Run! It's a guard!

[All of the customers run away screaming. Eda hops down from the table.]

Guard #1: [holds up Eda's wanted poster] Eda the Owl Lady, you are wanted for misuse of magic and demonic misdemeanors.

Luz: [peeking over the edge of the table] Whoa! Witch criminal!

Guard #1: [grabs Eda's arm] You are hereby ordered to come with me to the Conformatorium.

Eda: [frees her arm] Would you guys quit following me around? I haven't done squat.

Guard #1: And you're coming too... [picks Luz up by her hood]

Luz: Aah!

Guard #1: ...for fraternizing with a criminal.

Luz: Wh-What? That's not cool!

Eda: Oh, all right, all right, you win. Just let me get my stuff.

[Eda reaches under the table and grabs her staff, swinging it at the guard. He falls to the ground with a grunt. Eda spins her staff and taps the bottom of it on the table, making all her stuff float in midair. Luz picks herself and her book off the ground.]

Eda: Whoops. Can't forget this.

[Eda reaches into her hair and pulls out the key, pressing the eye to summon the portal door. She closes her hand into a fist, making the tablecloth wrap itself around all of her stuff. She sticks her staff through the bundle and starts running.]

Eda: Follow me, human.

Luz: [following Eda] This is crazy. If I die here, my mom's gonna kill me!

Eda: Ha! I won't let 'em hurt you. A human like you is much more valuable to me alive than dead.

Luz: Wait. What's that supposed to--

Eda: Whoo-hoo!

[Eda jumps, pulling herself and Luz onto her staff. They take off into the sky as the guard runs into frame.]

Guard #1: You won't get away with this, Owl Lady! [looks at his hands] Yeah, all right. You did. You got away with it. She got away with it, everybody! Typical.

[Cut to Eda and a crying Luz flying on Eda's staff above the Isles.]

Eda: You can open your eyes now, human.

Luz: [does so, yells and nearly falls off the staff when she sees the ground below them] Flying staffs, crazy monsters, you're a witch! What is this place?

Eda: [picks Luz up and rights her] This is the Boiling Isles. Every myth you humans have is caused by a little of our world leaking into yours.

[Various winged creatures fly behind them as Eda talks. A griffin that looks extremely similar to the one Luz made at school flies up next to them and screeches.]

Luz: A griffin!

[The griffin barfs spiders.]

Luz: I knew it!

Eda: Yep. Griffins, vampires, giraffes....

Luz: Giraffes?

Eda: Oh, yeah. We banished those guys. Bunch of freaks.

[Eda lands the staff and hops off, though her hand stays behind.]

Luz: Aaah! [jumps off the staff]

Eda: Oops. [screws her hand back on] That happens sometimes.

Luz: [stands] Well, I've had enough adventure for today. This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about. So, can you help me get back home?

[Eda levels her staff in front of Luz, startling her.]

Eda: Only if you help me first. [chuckles, lifts her staff, and walks away with the bag following her] Ah, now, come along, human.

Luz: Whoa!

[Cut to a tower, on top of which is an owl with an uncanny human face that cackles. Zoom out as it flies down to reveal the Owl House, which Eda and Luz walk up to.]

Luz: [looking over her shoulder] Aren't you worried about those guards finding us?

Eda: Nope. My house has a state-of-the-art defense system.

Hooty: Hoot-hoot! Password, please!

[Eda pokes both of his eyes.]

Hooty: Aah!

Eda: We got no time for this, Hooty. Let us in.

Hooty: All right, all right! Geez! You never want to have any fun! Ow! Hoot!

[Hooty opens his mouth wide enough to completely cover the door. Eda and Luz step through, though Eda's bag stays outside. Hooty closes his mouth.]

Hooty: [burps]

[Cut to inside]

Eda: Welcome to, [snaps her fingers] the Owl House...

[Candles ignite. A fire in the fireplace starts, a cauldron starts stirring itself, and a broom starts sweeping the floor. Overhead, a depiction of an owl beast of some kind begins to glow with a great screeching noise. Luz looks at all of this in awe.]

Eda: ...where I hide away from the pressures of modern life. Also the cops. Mm, also ex-boyfriends. [chuckles]

Luz: This place is beautiful! [puts her book onto a coffee table] Do you live here all alone?

[Thudding footsteps shake the house.]

Eda: Actually, I have a roommate.

King: [deep voice] Who dares intrude upon I, [normal voice] the king of demons? [squeaks a rubber ducky]

Luz: [gasps] ¡Ay, que lindo! [runs forward and scoops King up in a hug] Eda, he's so cute! Who's a widdle guy? Who's a widdle guy? Is it you? Is it you?

King: [struggles to free himself] No! I don't know who your little guy is! Eda, who is this monster?

Eda: [drags Luz away from King] Oh, this is Luz, the human. [puts her down] She's here to help us with our little... situation.

King: Oh! Hooray!

Luz: Wait, wait, wait. I don't like the sound of this "situation".

Eda: Just... let me explain. [draws a spell circle that darkens and effectively turns into a storybook. Narrating:] King was once a mighty king of demons, until his Crown of Power was stolen, and he became... [cut to Luz hugging King again] this.

Luz: You mean this little bundle of joy?

Eda: [narrating:]The crown is being held by the evil Warden Wrath and locked away behind a magical force field that only a human can break through.

[The storybook circle fades, return to Luz hugging King.]

Eda: A human like you. If you help us retrieve his crown, we'll send you back to your realm. So whaddya say? Plus, [picks up King by his face and shakes him gently] who could say no to this cute face?

King: No! Please don't encourage her! [is dropped] Nyeh!

Eda: I mean, we're kinda your only way home.

Luz: So I don't really have a choice, do I?

Eda: Nope. [picks Luz up and tosses her over her shoulder as she heads for the door] Now, we've got no time to lose.

King: [picks up his rubber duck] Soon, Mr. Ducky, we shall drink the fear of those who mocked us. [follows Eda]

Luz: Where are we going?

Eda: Somewhere super fun.

[Cut to the Conformatorium, where thunder claps.]

Eda: The Conformatorium, a place for those considered unsuitable for society.

Luz: [notices Eda's wanted poster on the wall they're hiding behind] Whoa. These guys really have the hots for you.

Eda: Yep. But we were never caught because we're too slippery.

King: Try to catch me when I'm covered in grease. I'm a squirmy little fella. Aah! [falls off of Luz's head] You and I will sneak up to the top of the tower, where they're holding my crown.

Eda: And I'm gonna make sure the warden's distracted.

Luz: [gasps] Will I need a disguise?

Eda: Uh...

Luz: I've been waiting to use this. [pulls her hood on, flicks up cat ears] Meow, meow.

King: It's hideous.

Eda: Oh, you'll fit right in.

[Eda taps the butt of her staff against the ground, creating a round glowing platform. She steps away from it.]

Eda: Hang on tight.

Luz: Whoa!

[The platform rises, floating all the way up to a window in the tower. It disappears suddenly, forcing Luz to grab the edge of the window sill and King to cling to her feet.]

[Eda, meanwhile, tosses her staff and casually sits down on it as it rises.]

Eda: Meet you guys at the top of the tower.

King: [grunting as he climbs up Luz and into the window]

Luz: [also grunting as she pulls herself up and in, falling on her face]

King: Ha-ha! Cat's don't do that.

Luz: [sits up and gasps]

[The two of them marvel at the amount of prison cells before them, all of them occupied by shadowy beasts of varying shapes and sizes, though all of their eyes glow in the light.]

Katya: Hey, cat lady, how'd you get out of your cell?

Luz: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not a cat. [pulls her hood down] Also, I'm not a criminal.

King: Not yet, you're not.

Katya: Neither are we. The stupid warden likes to lock people up who don't fit in. Like, I write fanfics of food falling in love. [pulls out a book of said fanfiction] I like food, I like love... Just let me write about it.

Eye-Eating Prisoner: I'm here because I like eating my own eyes. [plucks an eye out of his head as he says this, swallowing it. The eye floats back into place.]

Tiny Nose: We are agents of fwee expwession! They will never siwence us!

Katya: Yeah, she's really big into conspiracy theories.

Tiny Nose: The world is a simulation! We are but playthings for a higher being!

Luz: [pacing around] Wait. These aren't crimes. None of you actually did anything wrong. [pulls out Eda's wanted poster] You're all just a bunch of weirdos. Like me.

[Thudding footsteps attract their attention.]

Katya: It's Warden Wrath! Hide!

Luz: [exclaims and runs into an open cell, pulling the door down as she enters]

[Footsteps continue until a door is pushed open]

Warden Wrath: I can hear you.

Luz: [whimpers]

Warden Wrath: [stomping forward] Just what are you fools whispering about? [looks down at Eda's wanted poster that Luz had dropped] Ah. The Owl Lady. [picks up the poster and crumples it, turning his fist into a hammer and slamming it into the door of Luz's cell] I'll get my hands on her soon enough.

[Warden Wrath looks into the cell, where Luz and King are huddled in the corner]

Tiny Nose: Fight against the oppwessor! We will wesist! We will conquer! We will never be afwaid of you, you old cweep!

[Warden Wrath walks over to her cell and opens it. She stares at the opening door.]

Tiny Nose: Hooway! I'm fwee! [squeaks]

[Warden Wrath grabs Tiny Nose, his fist fitting around her entire body. He holds her up and points at the other two prisoners.]

Warden Wrath: Let this be a lesson to all of you. There's no place in society for you if you can't fit in.

[He tightens his grip, making Tiny Nose squeak again. Warden Wrath stomps away, crushing the crumpled up wanted poster on his way out. A door slams, and Luz opens her cell, running to that of Katya.]

Luz: Don't worry. I can get you out. [pulls on the lever, but can't lift it] No! My weak nerd arms!

Katya: Just get out of here while you still can, kid. Enjoy freedom for us.

[Katya walks deeper in her cell. Luz reluctantly walks away. Cut to a hallway, where Eda flies up to Luz.]

Eda: Hey, I just checked. [hops off her staff] The warden is distracted, tormenting some tiny creature. He won't be coming around here anytime soon.

[Luz continues walking without saying anything. Eda watches her, confused. They reach a towering door reading "CONTRABAND".]

King: My crown! It's close! I can sense its power! [runs up to the door and fiddles with the doorknob that's as big as he is]

Eda: Aw, he gets so cute when he's thirsty for power.

Luz: It's not fair that they're all in here. They just want to be themselves. Why does everyone think that being a weirdo is so bad?

King: [grunts]

[The doorknob is thrown to the ground with a clink. King pushes open the door, cackling, and runs through.]

Eda: Come on, before he hurts himself.

[Something zaps]

King: Ow!

[Luz and Eda follow King in. Cut to the inside of the room, which is empty save a giant glowing pillar in the center. King rubs his skull before charging at the pillar headfirst, succeeding only in launching himself backwards.]

Eda: We have a human, remember?

King: Oh, yeah.

Luz: [takes a breath]

[Luz puts a hand against the pillar before walking through it. Inside are piles of what can only be described as as junk: everything from books to skulls to a dead fish in a tank. Atop the central one is a glowing crown.]

Luz: Wait a second. Is that a...

[Cuts to Luz holding a Burger Queen paper crown, looking incredibly frustrated.]

King: My crown! [jumps in place before taking the crown from Luz and placing it on his head] Yes. Yes! I can feel my powers returning! You, there. Nightmare critter. [points to a stuffed rabbit with one button eye falling out of a box] I shall call you Francois, and you shall be a minion in my army of darkness. Ha-ha! [picks up the rabbit]

Luz: That crown doesn't give him any powers, does it?

Eda: Uh, no.

[Luz glares at Eda.]

Eda: Oh, look at us, Luz. King and I don't have much in this world. We only have each other. So if that dumb crown is important to him, it's important to me. And besides, us weirdos have to stick together, you know?

Luz: [grins and blushes]

Eda: Well, we owe you one. Now, let's get out of here before the warden finds us and loses his head.

Warden Wrath: Too late.

[Warden Wrath's hand turns into a blade, and with an easy swing he decapitates Eda. Luz catches her head.]

Luz: [screams]

Eda: [sticking her tongue out like a bad fake corpse] Ow! Oh, I hate it when that happens.

Luz: [screams louder and longer]

[Cut to commercial]

Luz: Eda! Are you okay?

Eda: Yeah. This just happens when you get older.

Luz: Does it?

Warden Wrath: Finally, [transforms his hand back into a hand] I have you cornered, Eda the Owl Lady. [takes King's crown]

King: Weh?

[Warden Wrath walks closer to Eda and Luz. King follows him, his arms up and reaching for his crown.]

Warden Wrath: My guards could never get you, but I knew if I took your pet's toy, you'd come running. [crumples the crown]

King: No! My power!

Eda: What do you want with me? I've never actually broken any of your stupid laws... in front of you.

Warden Wrath: I want you... [pulls out a bouquet of flowers] to go out with me.

Eda: Wha...?

Luz: [disgusted] What?

Guard #2: Go, boss!

Warden Wrath: [shoots the guard a thumbs-up] You've always eluded our capture. You've always been the one who got away. I found that alluring.

Luz: I hate everything you're saying right now.

Warden Wrath: You stay out of this!

[Warden Wrath tosses the bouquet over his shoulder, turning his now free hand into tentacles to grab Luz and hold her above the ground.]

Warden Wrath: So how about it, Owl Lady? [picks Eda's head up by the hair] The most powerful witch of the Boiling Isles and the feared Warden Wrath. We'd be the strongest power couple ever. I mean, it's-- it's not like you can say no right now.

[Eda looks up at Luz, who's struggling to free herself from the warden's grasp. She looks to King, who gets picked up by one of the guards and also struggles for freedom.]

Eda: [sighs] All right, Warden. You win. I'd just like to say something first. Come closer. No. Just come a little bit closer. Just... Yeah, that's good. [blows raspberry]

[Warden Wrath yells and drops Luz, who also yells. He wipes Eda's spit off his mask.]

Eda: [laughs]

Warden Wrath: Impudent wench! Don't you know how many germs are in your mouth? Blegh!

Eda: Get over it. You had your guards stalk me, and then you cut off my head. I am not going out with you.

Warden Wrath: If you don't accept, then I have no choice but to des-- Oh!

[Luz hits him in the head with Eda's staff. He falls to the ground with a loud crash.]

Eda: [chuckles] Nice!

[The two guards step next to Eda's head. She glares at them as her body walks up behind them and drags their hoods over their eyes.]

Luz: Okay, we're going now.

[Luz runs forward, grabbing Eda's head. Eda's body frees King of the guard's grasp, and Luz grabs her by the waist and they all mount the staff.]

Owlbert: [unfurls his wings and hoots]

Luz: Expecto... flying? Magicus... escapicus!

Warden Wrath: [grunts as he gets up]

Eda: Gun it, magic stick!

[The staff takes off. Warden Wrath clamors to his feet.]

Warden Wrath: Owl Lady, I won't let you get away again!

[His arms transform into bundles of tentacles, which he uses to chase after the staff. Cut to them flying past prison cells, Warden Wrath in hot pursuit. Luz and the camera zero in on the lever keeping Katya's cell shut.]

Luz: Eda, lend me a hand!

[Eda places her hand against Luz's. They open the cells of the three prisoners Luz and King had talked to earlier. All of them look excited. They burst through an outer door high in the center of the Conformatorium with a yell from Luz, then plummet. Warden Wrath exits right behind them, front flipping off the pillar.]

[The staff and Warden Wrath fall toward the ground. Warden Wrath extends one of his tentacles, hitting the very back of the staff and launching Eda, Luz, and King off of it. They roll when they hit the ground, and Warden Wrath steps in front of them, his hand shifting into a blade again.]

King: Ow, my bones!

Eda: Luz... [reattaches her head, then reaches into her hair and pulls out the key to the portal door] go back to the human world. [hands Luz the key, then runs at Warden Wrath]

Luz: What about you guys?

King: [stands and runs to join Eda] If you think this guy is bad, you shoulda seen her last boyfriend!

Eda: Not my boyfriend. [grabs King and jumps back towards Luz, avoiding Wrath's blade-hands] Go! Go! [puts Luz onto her staff]

Luz: But-- But I--

[Eda slaps the bottom of the staff, sending it into the air. Warden Wrath takes off his mask to reveal a face that's mostly mouth, which opens to breathe fire. Eda expertly draws two spell circles, one that catches the fire and one that launches it right back. Wrath slams into the wall of the Conformatorium.]

Luz: [whimpering as she tries to not fall off the staff]

[Wrath stands up, brandishing his blade-hands and running at Eda again. The three prisoners peek out of the hole that he left in the wall. Luz flies down to talk to them.]

Luz: Why are you guys just standing there? This is your chance to escape!

Eye-Eating Prisoner: The warden'll catch us. He always does.

Katya: We belong here.

Tiny Nose: Self-doubt is a pwison you can never escape fwom.

[Prisoners muttering in agreement]

Luz: So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things. That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome. Don't you see?

Katya: Why are you helping us?

Luz: Because us weirdos have to stick together. [pulls her hood on and mounts the staff] And nobody should be punished for who they are.

[The three prisoners all cheer. Luz turns the staff around.]

Luz: Now, let's get 'em!

[They all follow Luz. Cut to Eda being thrown against the ground, and King being thrown into her arms a second later. Warden Wrath looms over them.]

Warden Wrath: No more running away, Owl Lady. Today I capture you once and for all!

King: [whimpers and hides his face in Eda's chest]

Luz: Go, go, go, go!

[The prisoners scream as they barrel into Wrath. Luz flies behind them.]

Eda: Luz?

Eye-Eating Prisoner: [while shoving Wrath] I eat my own eyes!

Tiny Nose: [trips Wrath] I think the world as a twiangle!

Katya: [holding Wrath down] And I practice the ancient art of fanfiction!

[Tiny Nose joins Katya in holding Warden Wrath down while Eye-Eating Prisoner grabs his arms and ties them together. He then flips Wrath onto his stomach, so he can see Luz descending on Eda's staff.]

Warden Wrath: You! Who do you think you are?

Luz: [points at Wrath] Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace. [wind blows her hair] Now eat this, sucka!

[Luz pulls her firecracker from her book report out of her messenger bag, tossing it into the air before hitting it with Eda's staff. The firecracker lands in Wrath's flaming mouth and goes off, sending fireworks into the air. He runs away, humiliated, fireworks still going off in his mouth, while the prisoners cheer.]

Tiny Nose: [jumping up and down] We are victorious!

[Ed, with King on her shoulder, walks closer to Luz, putting a hand on the human's shoulder.]

King: That was actually one of her better breakups.

Eda: Not a breakup. Anyway, let's bounce before any more monsters fall in love with me.

[The three fly off on the staff, fireworks still going off behind them.]

[Cut to the living room of the Owl House, where Eda leans her staff against the couch.]

Eda: Well, a deal's a deal. Let's get you home. [snaps fingers]

[The key flies out of Luz's bag and into Eda's hand. She presses the eye, and the portal door unfolds itself in front of the fireplace. Luz walks up to it, then hugs herself and turns back to look at Eda and King. King looks at the ground, visibly sad. Luz reaches into her bag.]

Luz: Before I go... [holds out the head of her Azura doll] I know it's not the same, but... [removes Azura's crown] a king shouldn't be without a crown.

King: [accepts the crown and places it on his head] This shall suffice. You there, plant! You are now under my command. [he points to something and walks off screen.]

Eda: [grabs the Azura book off the table and hands it to Luz] Oh, and don't forget this.

[Luz takes it, and the pamphlet for Reality Check Summer Camp that's on top of it, and walks toward the portal. She stares at the pamphlet before putting it under the Azura book. She pauses in front of the door, looking at it. She looks back down at her book, then up, at a mirror above the fireplace.]

Luz: [gasps]

[She holds up the book, on the cover of which is Azura in the foreground, with an older witch looking at a dog/cat creature in the background. She lowers the book to reveal the mirror showing a very similar image, King and Eda in the same positions as the creature and the older witch, and herself in the foreground between them. She brightens and turns around.]

Luz: Okay. I know you got your head cut off, and we started some kind of prison riot, but this was the most fun I've ever had.

Eda: [blinks owlishly in surprise]

Luz: I don't fit in at home. You don't fit in here. If I stay, we could not fit in together. [she looks at the pamphlet for Reality Check one last time, then crumples it] I'm not going back to summer camp.

Eda: [chuckles] What's summer camp? What are we talking about here?

Luz: I want to stay and become a witch. Like you. [holds her book up to Eda] And Azura.

Eda: [laughing] What? All right, that's crazy. [pushes Luz's book down] Humans can't become witches.

Luz: Maybe that's because they haven't tried. If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want.

King: [pulling at Eda's dress] Let her stay! [whispers] She can make us snacks.

Eda: [smiles and picks King up] Well, I could use a hand keeping this goofball out of the cupboards. All right. I'll teach you how to be a witch. But you have to work for me before you learn any spells. Deal?

[Eda holds out her hand. Luz looks at it before grinning and crushing the two in a hug.]

Eda: Gah! What's going on?

King: Too tight! Too tight!

[Cut to Luz opening the creaking door to a storage room. She unrolls a sleeping bag and, now wearing pajamas, throws herself on it, before turning over and taking a picture of her and her mom out of her messenger bag. She rubs her thumb over the glass before placing the frame right next to her pillow. Her phone vibrates, and she grabs it and turns it on.]

[A message from "Mom??" reads: How's summer camp? Luz's expression falls, and she moves her phone away from her face.]

King: [clears his throat, steps into view while holding Francois] Your sleep cocoon looks fluffy.

[Luz sits up and pats the sleeping bag. King curls up at the bottom below her feet and falls asleep. Luz smiles at him before replying to her mom: I think I'm gonna like it here". Smiling, she puts her phone down, turns to the side, and falls asleep.]

[Zoom out to the exterior of the Owl House. The giant stained glass eye above the door blinks.]

[Cut to title card]

Luz: King, listen to this!

King: [laying on Luz's stomach] Hey! Less ready, more scratchy!

Luz: [sits up] Sorry! Now that I'll be a student at Hexside, I wanna learn all about it! I've got a new crush, and her name is Education!

King: [bites the pamphlet] Nyah!

Eda: [kicks the front door open] Hey freeloaders! Guess what today is?

Luz: Is it your birthday!?

King: Is it my birthday?

Hooty: It's my birthday!

Eda: No! [closes front door] It's human treasure day!

[Eda tosses the Portal Door into the air. It unfolds and opens. Owlbert flies through, dragging a giant sack. The sack tears when he flips it onto the floor, revealing a pile of human garbage. The door closes.]

Eda: [hops onto the pile] Ahh, fresh garbage.

King: Ooo, gimme gimme gimme! [pulls out a teddy bear] Yes! Another worthy addition to my army of terror!

New Guy: I love cuddles and kisses!

King: Truly horrifying!

Eda: [to Luz] Yo, kid. Your trash pile's getting cold. While mine's getting hot! [pulls out a wire clothes hangar] I have never seen such an extravagant earring.

Luz: You can have my trash. Whoa! Did you know that Hexside was built on the bones of its rival school? One it literally conquered!

[Luz shows off the pamphlet, showing a picture of a much younger Principal Bump standing on various Glandus students, being cheered on by fellow Hexside students. The school burns behind them.]

Eda: [now wearing two clothing hangars as earrings and looking in a mirror] Yes I know all these things, I went there. It was the most harrowing period of my life. [to her reflection] Oh, hello!

Luz: Can you imagine it! Me, in the halls of Hexside, studying with Willow and Gus and- maybe even Amity! Amity! Oh cramity! We're supposed to meet so I can get my Azura book back! [runs out, slams door; reopens door] I love you guys!

Hooty: And I love you, Lu--!

[Luz slams the door again.]

Hooty: Aaah!

Eda: Eh, who needs her?

King: Yeah! This bear could be our new Luz.

New Guy: Being without you is just unbearable.

King: No! [throws New Guy] You're unbearable!

[THEME]

[Cut to the market.]

Luz: [running and looking around] Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity. Gotta find that- oh! [Sees the girl in question, wearing a new outfit.] There she is. Hey Amity! Luz is finally here!

[Edirc and Emira suddenly appear in front of Luz, surprising her]

Edric & Emira: Hi Luz!

Luz: Aa! [falls on her back]

Edric & Emira: [laughing]

Amity: Edric! Emira! Stop bothering her! [helps Luz up] Sorry, Luz, they insisted on coming for some reason.

Emira: [squishing Amity's face] Because we love you baby sister! Ah!

Amity: [shoves Emira off] They've been extra protective and nice towards me to make up for the library incident.

Edric: [leaning in] And we still apologize everyday.

Amity: [shoves Edric away, pulls book out of bag] In any case, here's your book.

Luz: [takes the book] So, what'd you think?

Amity: It was... fine.

Luz: [pulls a drawing out of the book] So fine you drew yourself with Malingale the Mysterious Soothsayer?

Amity: [blushes, destroys drawing]

Luz: This is great! Maybe we could even start an Azura club at school when we're classmates!

Amity: When we're what?

Luz: Surprise! [pulls out the pamphlet] I'm enrolling at Hexside!

Amity: Oh! Uh, sorry, but to be in my class, you need to take a placement exam and prove that you've mastered two spells. [shows the requirements on the pamphlet] I know you have your light thing. Uh, do you know anything else?

Luz: Placement exam? Spells?

Emira: Quit giving her a hard time, Mittens.

Edric: Yeah, of course she knows two spells. Right, Luz?

Luz: Pff. Yeah. 'Course I know two spells! [laughs nervously]

Amity: Because if you don't, they'll put you in the baby class.

[Amity hands Luz the pamphlet back, now flipped to the baby class page.]

Edric: Oooh! Brain idea!

[Edric kneels in front of Amity. Emira leans on Amity's back, trapping her between them.]

Emira: What if we all trained together? We could show off what we know!

Edric: What do you say, Luz?

Luz: Uh, actually, I have other training plans in a very far away place that I have to go to right now. [pretends to walk away] Bye! [actually leaves]

[Cut to the Owl House kitchen. Eda is reading a book titled "Bending Ingredients to Your Will."]

Eda: [humming] Wow, a surprisingly peaceful domestic moment. When will it be ruined?

Luz: [slams the front door open] Edaaaa!

Eda: There it is.

Luz: [runs in] Eda, Eda! Eda! [falls] You have to teach me a new spell right now!

Eda: Sorry, Luz! These vegetables won't cook themselves... yet.

[Eda dumps a potion onto vegetables. They all grow arms and legs.]

Eda: Alright, everybody in the pot!

Vegetables: [scream and run]

Eda: Why do I always think that's gonna work?

Luz: [stands] But I need to know two spells to get into decent classes at Hexside. I can make light glyphs. [pulls one out and activates it]

Eda: [shields her eyes] Aah!

Luz: But at the end of the day, that's the only spell I know. [falls face-first to the floor]

Eda: And whose fault is that?

Luz: [muffled] Yours!

Eda: Hah! Yep. Got me there.

Luz: [stands] Just teach me a spell now. Any spell! It can be the darkest evil.

Eda: Well, I have been researching my texts on wild magic, but I'm much too busy right now. [throws book in the pot]

Luz: Come on Eda! You're the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. How would it look if your apprentice got thrown into the baby class?

Eda: Hmm. Weaponizing my pride. Well played. Well, in that case, this looks like a job for magic boot camp.

King: [opens back door] Did someone say boot camp? I agree to run it. We'll rise at dawn! You'll carry me on your back as I yell hateful things about your performance!

Eda: Nope. You'll have no part in this. Luz needs to focus, and I can't have her go all weird when you do something adorable.

King: I am not adorable! [stomps]

Luz: Aww, he stamped his little foot!

[King squeals and leaves, slamming the door behind him. It reopens. He slams it again. It reopens. He slams it harder.]

Eda: Now, no time to waste. You'll have to follow my teaching exactly. We gotta go somewhere special.

Luz: Yes!

Eda: A place where magic energy just flows.

Luz: [climbs onto the counter; louder] Yes!

[Cut to Eda and Luz standing in winter gear surrounded by snow.]

Eda: A place like, the Knee!

Luz: YES!

[Luz's cry echoes across the Isles.]

Eda: The earliest witches came to the Knee to develop their magic, drawn to its natural power.

Luz: [gasps] It's beautiful!

[Ruins covered in snow are shown.]

Eda: [gestures to the side] Though, it's not without its dangers.

Luz: [screams]

[A Slitherbeast is gnawing on a tree trunk.]

Eda: The Slitherbeast! Don't worry, if you don't mess with him, he won't mess with you.

[Luz blows a raspberry at the Slitherbeast. It bites through the tree trunk and sniffs in Luz's direction.]

Luz: [yelps, runs off]

Eda: Here's where we'll set up shop.

Luz: I'll definitely learn my second spell here! Gorgeous views, magic in the air. And best of all, we're completely alone!

[A pink light illuminates her.]

Eda: Watch out!

[Eda tackles Luz seconds before a pink fireball hits the spot Luz had been standing in. Eda pops up over the rocks they fell behind with her staff drawn. Luz also pops up.]

Luz: [gasps]

Amity: Sorry, whoever's over there!

Luz: [ducks back down, hides her face with her hat] Forget teaching me a spell, just make me disappear.

Eda: Well, okay, but I've got a 60/40 record of making you re-appear. Oh! You meant... ah, never mind.

[Edric and Emira wave.]

Edric: Hey Luz!

Emira: Luz!

Edric: Hey, it's us!

Luz: Okay, let's do this. [stands and waves] Hey guys!

Eda: Who are they?

Luz: [grabs Eda's jacket] Be cool! If they know I haven't mastered two spells, they'll think I belong in the baby class!

Amity: [walking toward them] What's that about the baby class?

Eda: Only that it's for babies and Luz here clearly isn't a baby. [to a glaring Luz] Nailed it. [whistles and walks away]

Luz: Amity! [slips, poses on the ground] Wha... What are you doing here?

Amity: I'm here to train. I'm trying to beat Ed and Em's highest score on the exam.

Emira: [popping up from behind Amity] Aw, Mittens. That's impossible!

Edric: [also popping up from behind Amity] She still needs to use a training wand to learn new spells. So what are you workin' on? Something powerful?

Luz: Yup! Powerful spells! I'm workin' on one that's so crazy! Eda's a pretty incredible teacher.

Eda: [carrying a basket of snowballs] Luz! I should now teach you how to identify different types of snow- by taste! [holds out a snowball] Go on, eat the snow. [shoves it in Luz's face]

Emira: Is this some kind of... special magic?

Amity: Ahem. I don't think the Owl Lady wants to show us any of her powerful spells. [leaves]

Eda: [points at her mouth full of snowballs; swallows] Oooh. Brain freeze! Brain freeze!

Emira: See you around, human! Good luck with your, uh, training.

[Edric picks up a clump of snow and tries to lick it. Emira knocks it out of his hand and drags him away.]

Edric: Aw.

[Edric and Luz wave to each other.]

Luz: Eda! Can you please take this seriously?

Eda: You need to take me seriously. Go taste snow without my guidance, see where it gets you.

Luz: [looks downcast]

Eda: Oh. [sighs] Don't worry kid. [ruffles Luz's hair] If you listen to me, soon you'll be doing stuff like that.

[They look at the Blights. Amity reads from Magic 101, then aims her training wand at a tree and draws a spell circle with it. The produced fireball destroys the tree. The battery light on the training wand flashes.]

Eda: And it won't be with some wack training wand, it'll be the real deal. But you have to trust me, okay?

Luz: [nods] Okay. I trust you.

Eda: We've covered snow, so now it's on to smelling moss. [pulls moss out of her pocket] Now the trick is, [shoves the moss up her nose] you really gotta get it up in there.

[Luz's expression falls. Cut to outside of the Owl House.]

King: This is ludicrous! I once led armies. I can lead a dang boot camp! But I have no recruits. [looks at New Guy and Francois] Or do I?

Hooty: Yep! It's your faithful pal Hooty reporting for duty! Up at dawn, taking orders all day long!

King: Ugh, no! You are too desperate! [goes inside, returns with all his toys] Role call! [says their names as he puts them down] New Guy, Aloysius Turtle, Chip, Beefy Bob, Francois. [pause, picks up Francois] Oh, you're perfect already! As for the rest of you, I'm only saying this once so listen up!

[New Guy falls onto Aloysius Turtle.]

King: Huh it's no fun if they don't tremble.

Vegetables: [laugh, throw cooking supplies off cliff; cheer]

King: Ohh okay, alright. [looks between the vegetables and his toys] Yep, an idea is happening!

[Cut to the Knee, where Eda is sitting in front of a fire drinking out of a mug and Luz is walking out from the forest.]

Luz: Ugh. Okay. I've identified the smells of three different rocks, sorted all the twigs from big to small, and found your glove, and your hand. [lifts glove off of Eda's detached hand]

Eda: Ah, I was wondering where that thing went. [screws her hand back on]

Luz: So what now?

[Cut to Amity training with Edric and Emira. Amity sends a jet of fire at Edric with the training wand. He dodges it. Emira summons an arm of snow. Amity blocks and destroys it with a shield. Amity dispels the shield and waves at Luz. Edric uses the distraction to make Amity sink in the snow until only her hand is showing.]

Luz: [giggles]

Eda: Hey. I know my lessons seem weird but this is what wild magic is all about! Making a connection with nature. The earliest witches understood that. Human witches need to understand it too. You wanna learn a second spell?

Luz: With all my heart.

Eda: Then you have to learn from the island. [guides Luz to a rock, makes her sit down] Now look.

[The rock overlooks the Titan. Its Ribs are nearly the same height as the Knee, and Its Skull is towering even from the opposite end of the Isles. Luz stares at the sight in awe as wind blows past her.]

Eda: And think about what the island is trying to tell you. [leaves]

Luz: [takes deep breath] Alright, Luz. Look. Look with everything you've got. Focus. [raises her right hand and speaks through it]

Luz's Right Hand: Focus? On what? On you'll be stuck in the baby class?

Luz: No! Don't think like that!

Luz's Left Hand: Face it, you'll never get a second spell following Eda's lessons.

Luz: Silence, hands!

[A crash gets her attention. Amity has destroyed a pillar with her training wand.]

Emira: [offscreen] Amity! Dinner's ready!

Edric: [offscreen] I caught a bat!

Amity: Edric, don't eat that. [puts her book and wand into her tent, walks off]

Luz: If I wanna be in the same class as Amity, I'm gonna need to learn magic like Amity.

Luz's Left Hand: Great work, Luz!

Luz: Shh! I don't need your validation.

[Cut to the Owl House's kitchen.]

King: Military discipline, cooking! Ha, I truly am a demon for all seasons! [pours the potion from earlier on his toys, except Francois] Just a dash of Eda's secret sauce and I'm the creator of life!

[The toys' arms start moving.]

King: Yes, yes, yes! My loyal recruits!

[The toys all stand on two feet.]

King: Welcome to boot camp! You sure need it. Look at you: raggedy, pathetic, chewed on, you got a button hangin' off of your eye. Pathetic! But I'll mold you worms into... slightly... better kinds of worms. Your first mission: gimme snacks! Your commander is hungry, so pick it up!

[Aloysius Turtle, Chip, and Beefy Bob walk in the direction King pointed, while New Guy walks the other way.]

King: [smacks New Guy] Hey, Private Dingdong, snacks are that-a-way! You better shape up recruit, you're in my boot camp now.

[New Guy's eyes flash red. Cut to the Knee, where Edric is holding a bat. Emira and Amity glare at him.]

Emira: Ed, give me the bat.

Edric: No! If we're not gonna eat it, I wanna keep it as a pet! [runs off]

[Emira and Amity follow him.]

Emira: Get back here before that thing bites you!

[Luz sneaks into the Blights' tent and takes Amity's wand and book. She goes to a ledge near her and Eda's tent, where she kneels down and opens the book. Inside is a drawing Amity made.]

Luz: Huh. Her crosshatching has improved.

[She moves Amity's drawing to show a page titled "Fireball." Under an image of a witch casting the spell is the word "FOCUS" written in runes.]

Luz: Oh man, oh man. [stands and draws a circle with the wand; gasps] Yes!

[She shoots the fireball off. It explodes like a firework.]

Luz: I did magic! I did magic!! [jumps in place] Without drawing anything! This thing is the coolest!

Eda: Hold it right there. What are you doing with that?

Luz: I'm doing magic, what would you have me do? Eat more snow? Lick a rock?

Eda: [pauses] Okay, so maybe my methods are... unique, but so is your magic. Connecting to the island can help you. That wand can't.

Luz: Well, it's already helped me. Just watch what I can do!

[She draws out another spell circle. The power bar on the wand flashes a low battery bar. Luz loses control of the fireball.]

Luz: Wh... whoaaa!

[The fireball goes off further into the Knee. When it lands, birds fly off.]

Slitherbeast: [growls]

Eda: [gasps]

[The Slitherbeast jumps over the trees. A large patch of fur has been burned off over its mouth.]

Slitherbeast: [growls]

Eda: You've angered the Slitherbeast.

Slitherbeast: [growls]

[Cut to commercial. Return to the Slitherbeast roaring.]

Eda: You've angered the Slitherbeast!

Luz: Will it accept a heartfelt apology?

[The Slitherbeast sniffs and sees the still smoldering-tip of Amity's training wand. It growls and runs at Luz.]

Luz: [screams]

Eda: [shoves Luz] Watch out!

Slitherbeast: [grabs Eda]

Eda: [screams, strains]

Slitherbeast: [growls]

Luz: Eda!

Amity: Luz!

[The Blights arrive.]

Edric: What did we miss?

Amity: And what are you doing with my wand?

Luz: Um...

[Amity takes her wand and her book and holds them protectively.]

Emira: Mittens, we've got bigger problems.

[The Slitherbeast advances on them, Eda still held in one claw. It growls at them.]

Emira: [running in front of Luz and Amity] Aw, he's so cute. Can we keep him?

Edric: [runs up with Emira] It's no bat, but we could try.

[Edric and Emira both cast a lasso at the Slitherbeast's hands. It growls and pulls at the bonds. Edric and Emira struggle to keep hold.]

Eda: You got it! Now finish it off!

Amity: I'm on it! [runs forward and tries to cast with her wand, fails] What?

[Amity smacks the wand against her hand, then notices the low battery light. She turns to Luz.]

Amity: Did you use this all up?

Luz: I... I didn't know!

Emira: Come on, Luz!

Edric: Do those powerful spells you were talking about!

Luz: But I don't actually... know any.

[The Slitherbeast growls and frees its hands with a yell. Emira and Edric are yanked into the snow.]

Amity: Edric! Emira!

[The Slitherbeast picks up the Blights, but Amity falls through.]

Amity: No!

[The Slitherbeast puts Edric and Emira into the claw holding Eda and runs off. The captured witches yell as the Slitherbeast goes. Amity and Luz follow them for a bit, then stop, panting.]

[Cut to the Owl House living room, where King's toys have loaded up the couch with snacks.]

King: Yep, keep 'em coming. [to Aloysius Turtle] And don't forget the pretzels this time. [takes bag of chips and opens it] Running a boot camp is tough work, but as my second-in-command, you deserve this.

[King dumps the chips onto Francois. New Guy watches them fall and tries to reach for one.]

King: Hey, hey! Private New Guy! You're not privy to snacking privileges, back away!

[New Guy's eyes glow red again, this time not fading back to blue. He walks off the arm of the couch without breaking eye contact with King.]

King: [yawns] Leading this boot camp has tuckered a little guy out, so Sergeant King signing off.

[King puts a night cap on Francois and himself and closes his eyes. A shadow falls over him.]

King: [opens eyes] Excuse me?

[New Guy is looming over him, his eyes still glowing.]

King: Could you maybe turn down those eyeballs? Trying to sleep.

[He closes his eyes again. More shadows fall over him. King opens his eyes. All of the animated toys are now looming over him, their eyes glowing. Beefy Bob pulls New Guy's string.]

New Guy: Don't you want a hug?

King: [hugs Francois] Ah!

[Cut to the Knee, where Luz and Amity watch trees shake as the Slitherbeast runs through them.]

Luz: What do we do?

Amity: I am going after them. You are staying here.

Luz: But the beast has Eda!

Amity: [advances on Luz] And because of you, it also has my brother and sister! Now stay put. [pauses] You'll only get hurt.

[She draws a circle in the air. A matching circle appears on the ground around Luz. With a flick of Amity's hand, a cage rises from the circle on the ground. Amity runs.]

Luz: Amity! Wait! [gets shocked by Amity's cage] Stupid island. [kicks rock] Ugh! Ow. [sits on the rock, looks at the Titan's Skull] You were supposed to teach me magic.

[She looks up, where clouds are parting to reveal stars. Snow is beginning to fall.]

Luz: But I'll never learn more than this.

[She pulls a notepad and a pencil from her pocket and draws a light glyph. She activates it and watches as it flies into the sky. Stars blink above.]

Luz: Wait. Is that...

[The stars form a constellation in the form of her light glyph. She traces the outer ring with her finger.]

Luz: ...a light glyph? But what does that mean?

[A snowflake lands on her glove. She looks at it, seeing a pattern in the center before it melts.]

Luz: Whoa.

[Determined, she grabs a stick. She breaks a twig off of it and catches another snowflake.]

Luz: It means... magic is a gift from the island. It means...

[She draws the glyph from the snowflake into the snow with the twig, adding a diamond to the bottom. She taps the glyph on the ground, backing away when a small pillar of ice rises from it.]

Luz: ...magic is everywhere!

[Luz grabs the bigger stick and replicates the ice glyph, this time the entire size of the cage.]

Luz: Magic is everywhere!

[She jumps off the rock and activates the giant glyph. The resulting ice pillar grows taller than the cage, launching her through the air.]

Luz: Woooo-- aaah! [lands in the snow] My second spell! [pops out] Thank you, snow! Thank you, island! Thank you, Eda. [pauses] Eda! I have to save her. [She gets out of her hole and runs.]

[Cut to outside of the Owl House. Hooty is listening to loud music through headphones.]

King: [from inside] Hey! How dare you mutiny! Unhand your commander right now! Ah! [is thrown through a window with Francois] I gave you life, I can take it away!

[Arrows and knives land around King.]

King: AH!

Hooty: [knocks headphones off]

King: [rolls over, stands] Hooty, Hooty! Great news, buddy, you can be in the boot camp! First task: destroy the boot camp.

Hooty: Hmmmm, no thanks!

King: What? But you begged to join!

Hooty: Sorry. You said I was desperate, so now I'm playing hard to get.

King: [rages] Ugh! What do you want?!

Hooty: I don't know. What are you offering?

King: Hmm... [holds up piece of chalk]

[Cut to a body now being drawn around Hooty, so that he's the face.]

Hooty: Wow, this is incredible! It's so real! You got yourself a deal! [opens door] Hooooot!

[Hooty rips apart King's toys. Stuffing, a button, and an arm land at King's feet as he watches from the doorway.]

King: This day shall live in infamy.

[New Guy's head is thrown against the door frame.]

[Cut to the Knee, where Luz runs out of some trees. Growling is heard from a cave obscured with fog. Inside the cave, the Slitherbeast spits purple goop at the wall. It shoves Eda, Emira, and Edric against it. The goop closes around their torsos. The Slitherbeast hops away.]

Emira: Don't worry. We'll be fine!

[Skeletons drop from the ceiling.]

Edric: No, we're gonna die.

Luz: That's right. [pops up with a skull over her face] Death is here. [lifts skull] Just kidding, Luz is here!

Eda: Kid, get outta here! I'm just gonna sneak away when the thing starts eating the twins.

Emira: Wait, what?

Edric: [offended gasp]

Luz: Don't worry, Eda, I get it now. I was so obsessed with learning my second spell, I didn't listen to you. But now I'm gonna save you! [jumps away] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Eda: Well, at least I got to see her misplaced confidence one last time.

[Cut to Amity peeking around a boulder with a serious expression. Luz pops up under her with a similar expression. Amity notices Luz and her expression becomes shocked.]

Amity: Luz!

Luz: [grinning] Hello!

[They both duck behind the boulder.]

Amity: H-how did you get past the barrier?

Luz: Magic! Literally! Now, forget that, because you and I are gonna have to work together if we want to save everyone. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. [whispers to Amity]

[The Slitherbeast returns. It sprinkles assorted seasonings on Edric, Emira, and Eda's heads.]

Eda: [sneezes] Ugh, I hate garlic.

Luz: Hey! You big idiot! [waves her arms] Over here!

[The Slitherbeast turns and growls. It jumps at Luz, who runs. Amity climbs up to her siblings and Eda.]

Edric: Amity!

Emira: Use that fire spell we taught you!

Amity: But I can't do it without the wand!

Emira: Yes, you can. Just focus.

Amity: Okay.

[She slowly traces a spell circle in front of her. It wavers when she concentrates, but a ball of pink fire appears after a moment.]

Emira: Cool. I didn't think you could actually do it.

[Amity melts the three of them free.]

Luz: [screams]

Amity: Luz!

[Cut to Luz dodging the Slitherbeast and running out of the cave. The Slitherbeast follows her until she gets to a tree and stops.]

Slitherbeast: [growls loudly]

Luz: Gotcha!

[Luz steps on a huge ice glyph drawn into the snow. She ducks away from the rising pillar of ice. The ice launches the Slitherbeast into the air, it lands hard on its back. Everyone else runs out of the cave. The Slitherbeast rights itself, screeches at the witches, and runs at them.]

Eda: You want me to teach you kids something cool?

Amity & Emira: Yes!

Edric: Yes, please!

Eda: [runs forward, draws complicated spell circle] Sleep spell!

[Her spell circle passes around the Slitherbeast. It immediately falls to the ground and begins snoring.]

Luz: Now that's my mentor! [runs up to Eda] Did you see? I learned my second spell, I made the connection!

Eda: I saw. [ruffles Luz's hair] Nice work kiddo.

Emira: You showed some real bravery in there, sis.

Edric: Yeah, nice work kiddo. [ruffles Amity's hair]

Amity: Stop! [fixes her hair and approaches Luz] So it looks like we'll be in the same class.

Luz: Azura Book Club? Azura Book Club!

Amity: [blushing] As long as it's a secret club, okay?

Edric: It's not a secret!

Emira: We're gonna tell everyone!

Amity: [sighs]

Eda: [sneezes] Alright, your adorable banter is literally making me sick. Let's go home already.

Luz: On it, teach!

[Luz draws another ice glyph and activates it. This one is a diagonal pillar of ice that sends them flying.]

Eda & Luz: [cheers]

Emira: I think we can go the normal way.

[Cut to the Owl House, where stuffing is raining down in the living room.]

King: Private Hooty, today when the felt flew you showed grit and determination that were instrumental in securing our victory. May I just say, it has been an honor, to be your commander.

Hooty: Sir, the honor is all mine.

King: Private, [hugs Hooty] our hearts have been touched by fire, and-

Eda: Ahem. [in the doorway with Luz, who looks around at the mess] What the heck did you two get into?

King: Um, excuse me? We're having a moment here!

Hooty: You'll never understand what we've been through together! Never! Never!

King: [walks away] Ugh, moment ruined.

Hooty: I will be haunted by my actions forever. Hoot hoot!

Lilith: I haven't forgotten what you've promised me. I will bring you my sister, Emperor Belos.

Kikimora: [behind Lilith] Then why the delay?

Lilith: [turns around in surprise] Kikimora!

Kikimora: The Day of Unity is fast approaching, and other teams have bound many rogue witches to covens, and yet The Owl Lady still roams free. Are you... protecting her?

Lilith: Rest assured, Kiki. I have everything under control. [snaps fingers and guards approach upon command] Today, we capture Eda, once and for all.

[THEME]

[Cut to the Owl House, where Hooty is fast asleep.]


Hooty: [snoring] Hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot...

Lilith: [from bushes outside of the house] Good. That infernal house demon is asleep. [beckons at the guards as they ready their weapons] Surround the house! 

[The guards go off in different directions.]

Hooty: Sleepwalking...sleepwalking [wakes up] Sleep-hooting!

[Hooty slams his face into the ground, popping up behind Lilith.]

Hooty: Hiya, Lilith! Peek-a-hoot! [smashes Lilith into a tree]

Lilith: [grunts]

[The guards charge.]

Hooty: Sorry! Eda doesn't like trespassers, but I'm always here to make new friends! Hoot! [bonks guard on the head and wears guard armor] Oh! Look at me! I'm a person now. Wobbly, wobbly! Ooh, blackout! [punches other guard] Hoot hoot! [throws guard armor away] Hoot hoot! Bye, friend! Ooh! I feel like dancing! [shakes body to hit the guards] Hoot! 

Lilith: [grunts]

[Lilith grabs her staff and stands. Hooty is bobbing in front of a tree. Lilith takes aim and fires.]

Hooty: I did it! [bends down and dodges Lilith's spell] Oh hey! Look, it's a bug!

[The spell slices through the tree, which falls toward Lilith. She just misses it, then collapses on the ground.]

Hooty: Aww! Just an old leaf! Well, that's good too. [eats leaf; making loud chewing noises]

[From inside The Owl House: Eda, who is wearing a yellow scarf, watches Hooty fighting the guards through her binoculars.]

Eda: Hooty! Ah, you're a thorn in my side [takes a cup of tea as a coven guard is slammed into the window] but you always dig your way into my heart.

[Luz is intrigued by what's brewing in Eda's cauldron.]


Luz: Ooh, magic 'sghetti. [tries to touch it]

Eda: Hey! [magically slaps Luz's hand with the spoon] That 'sghetti is Witch's Wool. It repels powerful spells. [holds up some of the wool] Every witch worth their salt has a cloak made from this stuff.

Luz: [stares at the wool adoringly] I'm worth salt... I want cloak! 

[Luz tries to grab the cauldron but Eda pulls it away from her.]

Eda: Easy, kid! With the Emperor's goons at my doorstep, I need this for protection. They have really stepped up their attacks lately.

Luz: [stares at her intensely] I think I finally understand why the Emperor wants you so badly. [jokingly] He's got the hots for you, doesn't he?

Eda: [fingerguns] Uh, but no. Emperor Belos wants to control all wild magic through his coven system. He ordered my capture years ago because I refuse to fall in line. 

Luz: And he won't stop until he's got you... [droops head]

Eda: Awww, don't sound so worried. I'm a master escape artist. The only thing that can slow me down is my curse, and that hasn't bothered me for weeks! [feathers pop out from Eda's arms] Uh oh...

[Eda transforms into The Owl Beast as Luz gasps in horror.]

Luz: King!

King: Weh? [peeks into the room] AH!

Luz: Get the elixir! Now! 

[The Owl Beast raises its head. Cut to Eda gasping, now standing in a void. Her childhood bedroom materializes out of the gloom. Her younger self is sleeping.]

Eda: [sighs sadly]

[The door opens behind her, revealing a indistinct shadow. Eda looks at it.]

Eda: You know, I'm getting a little tired of this game. [approaches the shadow, trying to grab it] So, why don't you just show me your face?

[In the real world, Eda is now holding Luz's face as Luz holds an empty bottle of elixir to Eda's mouth.]

Eda: [muffled] Oh. [lets Luz's face go and takes bottle out of mouth] Whew! Oh, thanks for this! [stands, knocking over about a dozen other empty bottles] And those...

[Eda's scarf falls off, revealing that her gem is still half black.]

Luz: Hey, your gem! It's still dark!

Eda: Uh...[pulls her scarf back on to cover her gem] No, it's not! You're nuts!

Luz: [points finger] The curse has been getting worse and you've been hiding it!

Eda: Ugh... you're right. It's taking more elixir to turn me back and more magic to keep the curse from rearing its feathery head. 

Luz: What happens if you use your magic up? Do you... do you die?!

Eda: No! Jeez, you're morbid. I just kinda sorta, turn into the Owl Beast... forever. Ahhh, it's a fate much worse than death if you think about it. [laughs sarcastically]

Luz: No! No, I-I can't let that happen! I'll do something about it. I'll find a cure and then--

Eda: [puts her hand on Luz's shoulder] Hey, don't worry. I just have to limit my magic use a little. [makes Luz grin] Ah! There's the Luz I know!

Luz: [sadly pouts with puppy eyes at Eda]

Eda: Ugh. Go on. Do the parallel arm thing...

Luz: [immediately beams and hugs Eda]

King: [also hugs Eda] King demands huggies too!

Eda: Okay! [walks in a strained manner with Luz wrapped around her and King on her leg] It's... time... for... school! 

[Cut to the kitchen door, which Eda drops Luz out of.]

Eda: Have a good day!

Luz: Get rest! Drink lots of water! Stay out of the sun! Lift with your knees, not your--

[Eda slams the door.]

Eda: Ah, what a good kid! So considerate. She deserves something nice. [picks up cauldron of witch's wool] And I think I know what!

[Cut to Luz walking to school, talking to herself.]

Luz: Poor Eda. Enemies everywhere, even her own body. I wish I could help her.

[A distant scream grabs Luz's attention. She peeks through bushes to see Hooty, wrapped around beaten up guards, serving them tea. One of the guards is feebly trying to escape.]

Hooty: [to guards] The roughhousing was fun, but I like this part of our playdates even better!

[Luz stands and shudders, then runs to school. She passes a ringing compact mirror on a pile of dirt, out of which Lilith's arm bursts. She grabs the compact and opens it as she drags herself out, a bird nest on her head.]

Kikimora: [from screen] The Emperor demands your presence in the throne room. And there's a bird on your head.

[Lilith looks up, where there is in fact now a bird in the nest.]

Bird: Oooo... you're in trouble! 

[Lilith groans and closes the compact mirror. Cut to Hexside, where Principal Bump and various students are lined up for a flying ship. Luz walks up to Willow and Gus.]

Gus: Luz, you ready for the field trip of a lifetime to the one, the only, Emperor's Castle!

Luz: Right. I was actually gonna stay behind. I don't like the way they treat Eda.

Gus: [shoving a book in Luz's face] But you're gonna miss out on all the cool stuff!

Luz: Like what?

Willow: Like ancient relics! Look, it's the Plant Coven's Green Thumb Gauntlet! It can grow whatever you imagine.

[The book shows a picture of regular trees captioned "BEFORE." The camera pans to the "AFTER" section, where the tree tops now act as heads, they all have arms and abs, and one is holding an owl's nest.]

Luz: Mmm...

Gus: And the Oracle Sphere! [book shows a white sphere with a two-headed snake on it] It shows you which path will help you become your best self!

[Camera pans to the Healing Hat.]

Luz: [reading] "The Healing Hat. Made from the magic of the Savage Ages. It is said to cure the deadliest diseases... and heal any curse"?

Willow: Yeah! You can't miss this!

Principal Bump: All aboard students!

[Willow and Gus head for the ship, dropping the book. Luz looks at it.]

Luz: Mmm. [picks up book] You've done so much for me, Eda. Now I'm gonna do something for you.

[Cut to the flying ship headed for the Emperor's Castle. Students on board are cheering.]

Principal Bump: No roughhousing! Do not make me turn this carriage around!

[Cut to Luz's notebook. She has drawn the Healing Hat and written: "HEALING HAT HEIST 1. Sneak into castle! 2. Steal healing hat 3. Lift curse".]

Willow: Hey Luz!

Luz: Ah! [hides notepad] Um, what was that, Willow?

Willow: I was just saying we were getting close to the castle. [she and Luz look over the side of the ship] Emperor Belos built it as a symbol of unity. Before he came to power, folks were doing magic all wrong. He taught us that the only way to respect what the Titan gave us is through joining covens.

[Luz looks doubtful.]

Willow: It's a shame Amity couldn't make it. She would LOVE this trip.

[Cut to Amity's bedroom. She's lying in bed with her feet propped up on a pillow, her right one still in a cast. She looks at a poster on her wall of Lilith posing with a sword, the words "Join the Emperor's Coven TODAY!" written under her.]

Amity: Shut up.

[Cut back to the ship.]

Luz: So, Willow... would you say this Belos guy is like, powerful?

Willow: [chuckles] No offense to Eda, but the Emperor is the most skilled witch that's ever lived. He can even talk to the Titan.

[The ship lands in front of the castle. Towering doors open.]

Principal Bump: Now, the Emperor's assistant will be your tour guide. Please don't make me regret taking you here.

[Kikimora stands on a platform as a bridge extends to the ship.]

Class: Whoa! Look at that! [gasp] It's massive!

[The bridge retreats, bringing the students closer to Kikimora.]

Kikimora: Children of Hexside, Emperor Belos welcomes you to his castle. We're honored by visits from students. You'll soon be a part of the coven, some lucky few may even find their home here, in the mighty Emperor's Coven!

Class: She looked at me! Wow, some!

Kikimora: You... are the future of the Isles! My job is to teach you its past.

[They enter the castle. Guards flank either side of a hallway, saluting, as others walk on overpasses. The walls are covered in tapestries, murals, and statues.]

Class: Ooh. Whoa!

Kikimora: Today, the Isles are a place of peace and prosperity. But that wasn't always the case. [gestures to a mural of witches dancing around a fire] Up until 50 years ago, witches and demons practiced wild magic during what we called the Savage Ages. [leads the students away] Witches had access to corrupt knowledge, and that dishonored the Titan.

[Luz stops at a grate.]

Kikimora: That was, until our great Emperor ascended to the throne, and taught witches how to use magic properly. [gestures to a mural of Belos holding up a beam of light, witches below celebrating his power] Our next stop is the Emperor's personal collection of relics.

Willow: Oh! Luz, you'll like this. It's where- huh?

Luz: [struggling to open vent, notices Willow and Gus looking at her] Heh... Uh, love me a properly ventilated castle!

[Luz follows the rest of the group. Cut to a door opening.]

Kikimora: The Relic Room. These items are reminders of our great Emperor's overwhelming power. [passes the Oracle Sphere] From the curious and mighty.

Gus: Oooh.

Kikimora: [passes the Green Thumb Gauntlet] To the very handy.

Willow: Oh, I could grow such beautiful things with that.

Kikimora: [passes by the Healing Hat] And even, the most valuable.

[Luz stares at the Hat as Willow is admiring the Gauntlet.]

Kikimora: Come along, children.

[Willow goes to catch up. Luz starts walking towards the Healing Hat, but Gus runs up and drags her along.]

Gus: Let's go, Luz!

[Cut to a hallway.]

Kikimora: Here at the Emperor's Coven, we require members with sophistication, elegance, and grace.

[A door slams open. Lilith is standing there, leaves in her disheveled hair. She spits out feathers and vanishes her staff, then enters.]

Luz: [gasps, ducks around a corner]

Kikimora: Ahh! Make way for Miss Lilith Clawthorne, students.

Class: Oh, my gosh. The head of the coven! Wow!

Kikimora: Yes, and if I'm not mistaken, she's on here way to see the Emperor himself. Let's all wish her luck!

Class: Good luck Miss Lilith!

Lilith: [blushes, inhales] Thank you, students. Good luck with puberty.

Kikimora: This way, children.

[Most of the class follows Kikimora down the hall as Lilith enters a door. Luz looks after Lilith.]

Luz: Hmm.

[Cut to Lilith walking through the halls, Luz tailing her out of sight. The closer to the Emperor's room they get, the more pipes are visible snaking around the walls. Luz is nearly caught, but ducks behind a corner before Lilith turns around. When she continues on, Luz peeks. Lilith stops at a massive door to clean herself up before entering. Luz runs up and watches through the keyhole.]

[Inside is a massive throne room. A beating green heart, far larger than would belong in any current living creature, is hooked up to pipes above the golden throne, which is flanked with flaming braziers. Various guards are standing around the room, one with a mask resembling an owl standing directly behind the throne. Belos himself is sitting on the throne, his head in his hand. Lilith approaches the throne and kneels.]

Lilith: I am at your service, Emperor Belos.

Emperor Belos: [breathes heavily]

[A guard brings a palisman on a tray.]

Emperor Belos: Just a moment, Lilith.

[Emperor Belos takes the palisman. He sinks his finger guards into the palisman's neck, dragging a line and breaking its head off. Glowing green goop falls out of the palisman, which Emperor Belos pours into the eye holes of his mask. His eyes, unseen before, flash a glowing green.]

Emperor Belos: Ah, that's better.

[Luz gasps and pulls away from the door, covering her mouth. She whimpers and runs off.]

Emperor Belos: How's the hunt for the Owl Lady? I heard you attempted a raid this morning.

Lilith: Yes, but we were--

Emperor Belos: Unsuccessful? That was obvious enough. It's been over a month since you promised to bring me the Owl Lady. Well, where is she?

Lilith: If I just had more time, I--

Emperor Belos: I'm getting bored of your excuses, Lilith. Don't worry, I'll give you the time you need. Bring the Owl Lady to me by twilight. She'll join the Emperor's Coven and in return, I'll heal her little curse. But, if you fail... [nails dig into his throne, heart above the throne beats faster] you will be stripped of your rank and banished from my coven. You do know what happens to covenless witches, don't you?

[Lilith looks over at the same mural the students saw in the hall. Screams overlay the scene; the witches depicted aren't celebrating his power, they're begging for mercy. Lilith stands.]

Lilith: I-- I understand. I will not fail.

[Lilith turns and leaves. Cut to the Owl House, where Eda is knitting with the witch's wool and King is napping.]

Eda: [holds up cloak] Yeah! Something tells me Luz is gonna like having a cape.

King: [wakes up] Cape? I thought you were making cake!

Eda: You thought I was knitting a cake?

King: I, uh... anyway! If there's no cake, then I have to get to work! [runs off] Would you look at us two, being all generous to that kid.

[crashing]

King: You know what, when she first got here, I thought we were gonna eat her.

[A louder crash knocks a picture off the wall.]

King: But now I only think of that, like, sometimes.

Eda: Yeah, she's changed the feel of this house.

[Eda picks up the fallen picture: one of Luz shoveling purple and green tentacles in her mouth, a banner behind her reading "FINISH OR DIE!"]

Eda: Well, she always had a good heart, but was impatient and always bit off more than she could chew. But despite all that, I think she's finally growing up.

[Cut to the Emperor's Castle. Luz peeks out of a curtain to look through a window, watching the class leave.]

Luz: Please don't notice I'm gone, please don't notice I'm-- boarding the bus?

[Sure enough, Luz is on the bridge. She turns around and sticks out her tongue at the real Luz.]

Luz: Huh?

[Willow taps Luz's shoulder.]

Luz: Wah!

[Luz turns around to see Willow and Gus, Gus spinning three spell circles.]

Luz: Oh! Guys. I, uh....

Willow: [pulls out Luz's notepad] You were planning on taking the Healing Hat, weren't you?

Luz: [sighs] You got me. But you don't understand. Eda has this curse and it's zapping away her magic, and--

Willow: Luz, no matter what, you can't steal this hat.

Gus: [steps in front of Willow] But, you can borrow it!

Willow: Hey! I wanted to say that! We learned about Eda's curse from your notes. We're totally gonna help you.

Luz: [almost crying] Thanks, guys. I know exactly what we gotta do. It's time for a heist!

[Montage: Willow, Luz, and Gus sneak through the halls when they see a guard coming down the stairs. They duck behind a small bush, which Willow grows into the shape of a unicorn. The guard stops, nudges its horn, and continues on. The three run off; Another guard is standing in a hallway. The three notice them and come out of a door stacked together awkwardly under one uniform. Luz, at the front, waves, high-fives the guard, and fingerguns as they retreat. The guard is very confused; Luz looks at the vent from earlier. She draws out a fire glyph and melts the vent; they reach yet another hallway, where Gus illusions up a double of Kikimora to send a guard off. Once the guard leaves, the illusion Kikimora does the worm. Gus laughs, oblivious to Luz and Willow's confused looks.]

[Finally, the three enter the Relic Room.]

Luz: Healing Hat. Mmm! You're Eda's last hope. [grabs hat, which glows] I-I can feel it! I can feel the magic flowing!

Gus: Me too! [holding Oracle Sphere] Finally, I'm about to become my best self!

[Gus holds the Sphere up, and a purple-tinted double of him appears.]

Gus Copy: You're always your best self.

Gus: [tears up, then starts crying]

[Camera pans to Willow wearing the Green Thumb Gauntlet. She grows a large wooden arm, which flexes and then sinks back into the Gauntlet.]

Willow: Whoa! I just wanted to try it out. [returns Gauntlet; chuckles]

Luz: Now we can cure Eda and get this hat back before anyone knows it's gone. [laughs]

[The scene distorts and pulses.]

Emperor Belos: I will know.

[The scene returns to normal. Everyone is looking at the ceiling. Luz and Willow back up nervously.]

Luz: We need to go. Now.

[Barricades drop in front of the doors, locking them in.]

Luz & Gus: [gasp]

[Doors to the relic room get locked, barricading Luz, Willow, and Gus inside.]

Willow: Stand back!

[Willow grabs the Green Thumb Gauntlet and grows a massive buff tree. It extends its arms at one of the barricades.]

[Cut to a hallway, where Lilith is pacing in front of the stained glass mural of Belos.]

Lilith: Lilith, think! You've given your entire life to this coven, you can't lose it. What's Eda's weakness? She has no attachment, no friends. Think!

[Lilith punches the wall at the same time a loud crash happens. She stares at her hand. Cut to the Relic Room, where the barricade now has a hole in it.]

Luz: [coughs]

[Willow's tree shrinks to nothing.]

Luz: Come on, let's go! [gasps]

[Luz stops at Lilith's pointed staff. Using her palisman, Lilith pushes down the hood of Luz's cowl.]

Lilith: Why, if it isn't Eda's human pet. How perfect.

[Luz backs up as Lilith advances on her.]

Lilith: Aren't I lucky to find you here.

Luz: Stay away! If you touch us, Eda will come after you so fast--

Lilith: [teleports in front of Luz] That's the plan.

Willow: Run, Luz!

[Willow raises the Green Thumb Gauntlet and grows a wooden arm to grab Lilith's staff. Luz runs. Lilith uses her staff to fling Willow toward the door.]

Gus: Wrong move, Lilith. It's two against one, and you don't stand a chance against--

[Lilith poofs Gus's copy, and throws him across the room with Willow.]

Lilith: Now, that doesn't belong to you. [magically grabs Healing Hat]

Luz: No!

[Luz tries to free the Hat from Lilith's magic. Lilith closes her fist, and the magic rips the hat in half. It disappears.]

Luz: No! I needed that to heal your sister!

Lilith: Huh. [grabs Luz] These decrepit relics are useless. If you wanna see your friend again, deliver this to Edalyn.

[Lilith throws her staff to Willow and Gus. The staff flies them away.]

Willow: Luz!

[Luz looks nervously at Lilith. Lilith smirks.]

[Cut to the Owl House, where Eda folds a completed witch's wool cloak.]

Hooty: [opens door] I spy with my little eye something coming this way!

Eda: Luz!

King: Wait! [pushes a cake into the living room] Wait for me! You're not the only one who knows dark magic! [holds up cake mix box] Now stop gawking and load me in!

[Eda stands and helps him in.]

King: Ow! Ow! Gentle!

[The shadow of Willow and Gus on Lilith's staff passes the window. They knock on the front door, which Eda opens. Her face falls when she sees it's not Luz.]

Willow: Eda, we have some bad news...

[Behind them, Lilith's staff is floating and glowing blue. Eda glares at it.]

[Cut to the bridge to the Emperor's Castle.]

Lilith: Come on, Edalyn. You would be late when I need you most.

[Lilith looks to the top of the castle, where Emperor Belos is watching. Yellow light flashes, and Eda appears. Lilith smirks. Eda throws Lilith's staff, which leaves a crater in the castle wall.]

Lilith: Sister! I see that you got my invitation to a Witch's Duel!

[Bolts of electricity fly at Lilith, though none hit her. Eda flies at her, taunting. Lilith blocks one hit with a summoned shield. She summons her staff and fires a bolt at Eda.]

Eda: Where is she? [flies at Lilith]

Lilith: Easy now.

[Eda stops.]

Lilith: The human is safe.

[Lilith taps her staff to the ground. A blue bubble flies out of the castle, Luz inside of it.]

Luz: Eda!

Lilith: [walks in front of Luz] You can have her back, provided you do as I say. Renounce your wild ways and join the Emperor's Coven. He can help heal your curse!

Eda: Don't believe everything that bonehead tells you. He doesn't want to heal me, he wants to control me!

Lilith: Then I will take you in by force. [spins staff]

Eda: You've always looked down on me because I'm wild, but fortunately, that just made me work harder than you.

[Eda slams her staff on the ground, summoning a towering owl made of light behind her. She rushes at Lilith, launching her in the air. Inside the castle, guards turn to watch. In the air, Eda appears behind Lilith. Lilith disappears as Eda swings her staff. Lilith reappears behind Eda right as Eda disappears. Eda appears behind Lilith and kicks her, then zaps away to chase her. From the bubble, Luz watches Eda and Lilith zip across the sky, nothing but gold and blue lights weaving and crashing. Lilith shoots a beam of light at Luz's bubble, sending it flying. Eda lands on the bridge.]

Luz: [yells]

Eda: Luz!

[Eda redirects the boards of the bridge to keep Luz from falling off. Lilith drops down, and Eda rolls out of the way to prevent being crushed. Eda summons a Hooty Hydra to wrap Lilith up. Eda spins her staff and sends a giant blast at Lilith. Lilith puts Luz between her and the bolt, which Eda redirects, missing them both.]

Eda: [panting] Stop hiding behind Luz, you coward! [groans]

Lilith: [panting] It's sad to see you slowing down sister. Tell me, is it the curse?

[Eda growls, the sound half Owl Beast. The darkness in her gem grows.]

Luz: Eda! Your gem! [bangs on the bubble]

Eda: [ignores Luz] Maybe it is the curse. But then how pathetic are you, that you can't best me at my worst?!

[Eda spins her staff and summons a dozen rings of magic, all of which send bolts at Lilith. Eda's Hooty Hydra drags Luz to safety as Lilith summons a shield to protect herself. Luz looks around and notices a pointed rock.]

Luz: [gasp]

Lilith: Maybe you are stronger than me, but that made me work smarter! I became smart, crafty!

Eda: A lapdog for a tyrant!

[Luz hits her bubble against the rock until the bubble shatters.]

Lilith: You always thought you were better than me, that I could never beat you in anything.

Eda: I am better than you!

Lilith: Then why were you so easy to curse?! [gasp]

[Lilith covers her mouth. Eda looks betrayed.]

[A flashback to Eda's bedroom door opening. Light from the hallway lights up her sleeping figure. The mysterious figure steps forward, shadows disappearing. It was Lilith all along.]

[Back to the present.]

Luz: [gasps]

Lilith: A-And I have the power to remove it, if you would just let me explain.

[Eda looks away. She shakes in anger. With a yell of fury, she rushes forward and destroys Lilith's shield, flinging Lilith in the wall hard enough to leave a crater.]

Luz: Eda, stop! Your magic!

[The black in Eda's gem is writhing furiously. Eda doesn't seem to care. Lilith smirks. Luz is surrounded by glowing blue and starts floating.]

Luz: [gasps]

Lilith: Human. That orb was for your protection.

[Lilith moves Luz over the edge of the bridge. The magic drops. So does Luz.]

Luz: [screams]

Eda: Luz!

[Eda draws a shaky spell circle with her staff. Luz stops plummeting a foot above a score of giant spikes. Eda strains to keep Luz up.]

Luz: Eda, stop! You'll run out of magic!

Eda: It's my power, kid. And before you showed up, I spent my whole life wasting it.

[Lilith grins evilly. She summons a giant hand to push Luz closer to the spikes.]

Luz: Eda, no, no, no!

[Eda's gem is almost entirely black. The whites of her eyes begin to be taken over.]

Eda: Alright, kid. Listen to me. I'm going away, and I don't know if I can bounce back this time. Watch over King. Remember to feed Hooty.

Luz: Please, no!

Eda: And Luz, thank you for being in my life.

[With a scream, Eda unleashes a powerful burst of magic. Owlbert flies off the staff. Lilith is pushed back, her spell broken. Eda's magic illuminates the Isles. Luz, several feet higher than before, falls. She stops inches away from a spike, and Owlbert picks her up by the hood and flies her back to the bridge, where Eda is laying.]

Luz: Eda.

[Eda rolls over and screams, her voice overlapping with the Owl Beast's. She slams a hand to the bridge, and the Owl Beast stands. It advances on Luz, who backs away. The Owl Beast tries to pounce, and Luz cowers, but the impact never comes, Lilith binding the Owl Beast and dragging it halfway across the bridge with her staff.]

Lilith: Come along, sister. Now we can let the healing begin.

[Lilith looks up to Belos. He turns away.]

Luz: You monster!

[Luz jumps on Lilith's back and tries to drag her down. Lilith grabs her by the cowl and throws her.]

Lilith: Leave, human! [grabs Owlbert] Edalyn is finally with her family. Her real family.

[Lilith taps her staff on the bridge. Gears turn, pulling the bridge toward the castle.]

Lilith: Go back to your world. This one is ours.

[Luz stands and tries to chase after them, but can't. The doors to the castle close.]

[Cut to Luz slowly walking back to the Owl House. The sun is rising; she's been walking all night.]

Hooty: [yawns] Oh Luz, there you are!

Luz: Hi, Hooty.

[Luz opens the door to the dark living room. She looks at the side, her eyes widening.]

Luz: [gasps]

[There are balloons and streamers hung up. Party hats are on the couches, and confetti is on the floor. Her new cape is wrapped in a bow on the table, next to King's cake, the candles of which have long burned out. King bursts out of the cake.]

King: [gasps] The cake is me! [looks around] Hey, um, where's Eda?

Luz: [gasps]

Luz: Emboldened by the dishonor Hecate had shown, Azura lifted her staff to the cotton-candy skies and shouted, "I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!" And look! I drew a flip book. [flips between two pages] Pew, pew, pew!

King: Show me the picture. [peeking over the top of the book]

Luz: What?

King: Show me the picture! [Luz does] Hah! I can draw better than that. You know, they once called me the King of Artists.

Luz: Wait. I thought you were the King of Demons. Are you just making this up now?

King: Doesn't matter. What's important is that my followers would leave me offerings in fear of me!

Luz: Well, I can offer you more of this tantalizing book.

Eda: Ugh! Please stop reading that. Its flowery language is an insult to witches and driving away all of our serious customers!

Luz: Um, Eda? [zoom out to the empty street] What customers? There aren't even any other stands around. What's going on?

Eda: This is a bad omen. There must be something horrible happening today.

Gus: Luz! [him and Willow run up to the stand] Something amazing is happening today!

Luz: Gus, Willow! Hey!

Willow: [holds up a flier] It's the annual covention! Student witches get to see all the types of covens before they're placed in one. There's even a mystery guest this year!

Luz: A job fair for witches! Eda, can we go?

Eda: Absolutely not.

Luz: [groans, drops to the ground]

Eda: I never joined a coven for a reason. Sure it's like a fun club for witches, but you're also giving up your magical independence to be part of a crooked system.

Willow: Mmm. [drops the flier]

Eda: Eh, but, you know, no judgment. In any case, I haven't been to one since we were girls.

Luz: "We"?

Eda: I-- the-- I mean--

Luz: [pops back up] Who's "we"? You have a mysterious past! Now we gotta go!

Eda: No.

Luz: Okay. Then you leave me no choice.

King: [grabs the book] "You shall not shan't doeth no more harm," Azura callethed out... [continues reading]

Eda: So flowery, so awful.

[Eda walks away, opening the Portal Door and stepping through it.]

King: "Hecate could only screech, screech as did she, for the screeching did worseneth."

[Luz tosses King through the Portal as it closes. It opens a second later, Eda coming back through with King sitting on her head.]

Eda: Stop it! Stop it! I will literally do anything to stop this!

[Cut to a long building, a sign in front of it reading "COVENTION TODAY alchemists anonymous tomorrow". Cut to the front of the building, where Luz is bouncing on her feet and Willow is clapping.]

Eda: [groans into her hand]

[THEME]

Eda: [grunting as she struggles to pull her hood on, King hanging off of it] Gotta keep a low profile.

Luz: [grunts as she tries to shove Eda's hair in the cowl] Is this cowl really necessary?

Eda: Do you think all my wanted posters are for petty theft? [numerous small objects fall out of her hair] Partly. [scoops the things back into her cowl] But the big whammy is I disobeyed the law and refused to join a coven. If I'm seen, I could go to jail. Again.

Willow: [approaching with one of Eda's wanted posters] Maybe this informative event will inspire you to join a coven.

[Eda traces a spell that pulls Willow's cowl over her face.]

Eda: Let's just get this over with.

[They enter the building.]

Luz: Whoa. Was I even alive before now?

[Several booths are set up inside, each with a sign for one coven or another. From the ceiling hangs nine large colorful banners. Two student witches fly by on broomsticks.]

Gus: Those are the main nine covens, but there are hundreds of other ones you can join.

Willow: [as they're all walking] There's Flower Coven, Artist Coven, Big Dog Coven, Small Cat Coven, Tiniest Cat Coven--

Eda: [groans]

Willow: Also the Grumpy Coven.

Eda: What was that?

[Willow yips as the kids and King all run.]

Man #1: Uh, excuse me, ma'am, but you look rather familiar. [looks between Eda's wanted posters and her]

Eda: Uh... No, I don't. Distraction spell!

[She reaches into her cowl and throws a bag on the ground. It's Hex Mix, which does nothing. Eda runs away anyway, but returns when the man bends down to grab it. She drags his hood over his face, scoops up the Hex Mix, and runs away again. Cut back to the kids as Eda rejoins them.]

Luz: [stops and points] Ooh, what's that?

Willow: That's the Construction Coven.

[Cut to a bearded witch in a hard hat and Tiny Nose standing next to a pallet of wood and a pallet of bricks. The witch grabs both pallets from the bottom and tosses them in the air. The materials fall down to perfectly construct a small house.]

Willow: One of the main nine. They use power glyphs to increase their strength.

[The witch removes his hard hat to pull of a power glyph from a stack atop his head. He peels the adhesive off the back of one and puts it on Tiny Nose's nose. Her pupils constrict.]

Tiny Nose: [screams and picks up the witch, throwing him in the air] Ha-a-a! I'm the destroyer of worlds! [grabs the Construction Coven sign and tosses it]

Man #2: Hey, that's the opposite of construction!

[Two witches run in to stop Tiny Nose as she grabs a giant hammer. Cut back to Luz.]

Luz: Yowza-wowza!

[A light blue double of Luz ducks out from behind her.]

Illusion Luz: Yowza-wowza!

Luz: Yowza-wha-a-a?

[Her illusion double walks over to two Illusion track witches. It waves at her and disappears.]

Gus: [runs over to the other witches] Ah! You've been taken in by the allure of the Illusionist Coven. We like to magic with a hint... [disappears in a cloud of smoke, reappears a few feet to the right] ...of showmanship.

[He bows as the other two appear next to him.]

Luz: Wow! Acceptance? Comradery? A sense of belonging? Covens sound incredible! Eda, why haven't you ever joined one?

Eda: Watch closely, Luz.

[Another Illusion track witch is now standing with one of the other ones.]

Eda: When you join a coven, all your other magic is sealed away.

[A seal in the shape of a mirror appears on the witch's wrist, light blue lines running from it up his arms and face. He pales slightly as the lines fade.]

Eda: From now on, that kid will only be able to make illusions. Since I never joined a coven, I can do every kind of magic. [creates a fireball in one hand and a ball of water in the other, then makes both disappear] That's why I'm the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.

[She walks away. Willow, Luz, and Gus hurry after her, amazed. King starts to follow, but is stopped with a hand on his shoulder.]

King: Weh?

Student #1: The tea leaves foretell that this [pulls out a pen] will lead you to your destiny. [puts the pen in his hands]

King: Destiny? Feh! I'm not paying for--

Student #1: [retreating into the shadows] It's free-e-e.

King: Are you bestowing gifts upon me? Yes! I accept your offering! The King of Demons is back!

[Cut to the doorway flanked with guards.]

Luz: That panel looks popular.

Gus: [gasps] It's the Emperor's Coven! Do you think they'll sign my forehead?

Willow: Only one way to find out!

[Willow and Gus run inside. Luz starts to follow them, but stops when she realizes Eda hasn't moved.]

Luz: Aren't you coming, Eda?

Eda: No way. Of all the covens, they're the worst. I'll wait out here.

Luz: I get it, Eda. Covens: bad. Individualism: good. But I'm still figuring this world out, so I'm going to go in there and make up my own mind, okay? [She walks in.]

Man #1: [to a guard] I just saw her.

Eda: Huh?

Man #1: [holding Eda's wanted poster] She's over there. I think that's her! [points at her]

Eda: Uh-oh. [runs in] Luz, wait up!

[Cut to a large stadium with a chattering audience. Eda sits down next to Luz.]

Eda: All right, let's see this mess.

[The lights dim. Principal Bump rises from the floor with spirals of green magic, a spotlight illuminating him. The audience applaudes and cheers as he summons a mic.]

Principal Bump: Hello, Bonesborough! Students ask me all the time, "Principal Bump, what's the height of magical achievement?"

Mattholomule: Is it this? [increases the size of his head greatly, crushes the student next to him]

Principal Bump: Wow. I failed you as a principal. [grabs the mic with some feedback] It's being selected to join the best of the best. And there are none better than the jewel of the coven system [three witches appear] and the enforcers of His will, the Emperor's Coven.

Luz: Whoa. [looks to the side and waves]

Willow & Gus: Luz! [pointing to Gus's forehead, which has been signed]

Principal Bump: Feast your eyes on this elite force, each member handpicked to help usher in a new age of controlled magic.

[Each Coven guard traces a white spell circle above their head. One produces a jet of flame, another water, and the third lightning. The three elements come together in a firework that turns to confetti, which Luz grabs.]

Eda: [to the demon next to her] When does that "elite force" get here? [laughs]

[The demon moves away. The Coven guards are now holding the same elements in balls between their hands.]

Principal Bump: Members of the Emperor's Coven have access to all-- yes, all forms of magic. Ooh. Aah.

Audience: Ooh. Aah.

Principal Bump: But... only the best can ascend these ranks. Some day that could be one of you!

[He points directly at Amity, who brightens and squeals.]

Eda: [laughs]

Luz: Hmm?

[The three guards grab their capes and disappear in flashes of white light.]

Principal Bump: And now, I'm pleased to introduce the esteemed leader of this coven and this year's mystery guest. You know her, you love her! Lilith!

[Audience gasps]

Eda: [stops laughing] Huh?

[A bright flash of light near the ceiling turns into a blue raven sitting on a branch. It flies off the branch to the stage, landing to reveal Lilith. It disappears with a screech as she lifts her arms and sends her mask flying. The audience applauds and cheers, while Eda is looking at her speechless. Luz notices.]

Luz: You know her?

Eda: You could say that.

Luz: [gasps] Mysterious past!

Lilith: Thank you, all. [magically sends her cape and mask back into Principal Bump] It wasn't easy for me to rise to the top. I also started from humble beginnings.

Mattholomule: Like me?

Lilith: Now I have the highest honor of enforcing the Emperor's will. So be more! The Emperor's Coven awaits you!

[She spins, creating the raven illusion again. It spreads its wings before bursting into balls of light. Lilith poses with her arms out, smirking, while Eda glares at her.]

[Cut to outside of the auditorium as Eda and Luz leave.]

Luz: Eda! Where are you going?

Eda: I'm gonna head home and wash the con funk off my skin.

Luz: But we haven't even taken the quiz to determine our coven type!

[She pulls out a thick magazine out of her pocket, flipped to a quiz named "What Coven Are You In?", and holds it above her head. Eda doesn't even look as she casts a lazer beam through it and walks away. Luz pulls the magazine down to read it, walking without looking.]

Luz: Ooh, a punky potionist.

[She runs into Amity, and they both grunt.]

Amity: Watch where you-- Oh, it's you. Willow's... abomination thing.

Luz: Uh... Hey, Amity. So, funny story. Not an abomination. Sorry for the confusion last week. I-I'm Luz. The human. Hi!

[She offers her hand, but Amity smacks it away.]

Amity: Ugh. Put that away. You're the one that got me in trouble with Principal Bump and I never get in trouble. [walks away]

Luz: [follows her] Well, to be fair, you were okay with him trying to dissect me, so--

Amity: [stops and turns around] You can't be here! This covention is for witches only.

Luz: Well, I'm learning how to be a witch. I'm receiving magic lessons from a powerful witch and a ferocious demon.

Amity: [looks over Luz's shoulder] Is that your ferocious demon there?

[Luz turns around to see King, decked out in merch, walking towards them. Two bakers are walking behind him.]

King: Cupcakes in my tummy-tum makes the King say yummy-yum!

Baker: So you'll join the Bakers Coven?

King: [eats a cupcake in one bite] Hmm... Nope! [steals a cupcake off the other baker's tray and runs] Oh, hey, Luz! Look at all those offerings-- [trips on his scarf] Wah!

[Luz goes to help him up. They both reach out for his dropped cupcake, failing to reach it before Amity steps on it. King gasps.]

Amity: Oops. That was an accident.

Luz: Why are you being so mean, Amity?

Amity: Because you and your pet are giving witches in training a bad name.

King: [while scratching his face with his hind leg] I'm not a pet!

Luz: [hugs him] He's a very good boy and the King of Demons! I'll tell you what, Amity. [stands] It's one thing to say I can't be a witch--

Amity: 'Cause you can't.

Luz: ...but it's another thing to bully my friends. Just like The Good Witch Azura said when facing down her rival Hecate at the Bog of Immediate Regret... I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!

[Everyone gasps. Amity takes several steps forward into Luz's face.]

Amity: I accept. Let's set the terms for this duel, shall we?

Luz: One, if I win, you apologize to King for squashing his cupcake.

King: [picking up the ruined cupcake] Good night, sweet child.

Luz: And two, you admit that humans can be witches too.

Amity: Fine by me. But when I win, not only do you have to tell the whole covention you're not a witch, you have to stop training forever.

King: Do it, Luz! For my honor!

Luz: Fine. Let's shake on it.

[Luz holds out her hand. Amity draws a spell circle around it before shaking.]

Amity: The everlasting oath is sealed.

[Amity pulls her hand back and the spell circle fades.]

Luz: That's probably fine.

Amity: Meet back inside the theater in one hour. [walks away] Let's see what kind of witch you are.

Luz: King, I-I can win this, right?

King: [eating his cupcake] Mmm? Oh, yeah. No.

Luz: [whimpers]

[Cut to Eda trying to sneak out of the covention.]

Lilith: Sister?

[Eda stops and turns, seeing Lilith surrounded by several Hexside students.]

Lilith: It's been so long since I've seen you last! [signs something and hands it to Mattholomule] What are you wearing? You look like some sort of trash collector. Oh, right. You are.

Eda: Oh, Lily. I just had to see the leader of the Emperor's Coven in action. [leans down to talk to the students] You know, when we were kids, Lilith was so excited to see the Emperor's Coven, she peed a little.

[The kids laugh, making Lilith blush.]

Lilith: That-- That's all for today. [ushers them off. To Eda] You shouldn't even be here. You're a wanted criminal! Unless... [gasps] I don't believe it! You are here to join the Emperor's Coven!

Eda: [chortles, laughs] In your dreams. [laughing]

Lilith: You think being covenless makes you so much smarter than everyone else. But while you run from the law like a degenerate, I'm mentoring the next generation of powerful witch students into the world.

Eda: Well, I have a student. And I bet she could wipe the floor with any of your prissy little blue bloods.

Lilith: [stepping closer] Is that a challenge?

Eda: Oh, it's a promise.

Luz: [pops up between them] Eda, I need your help! I accidentally challenged Amity to a witch's duel, and I think she's going to kill me all the way dead! [slumps to the ground]

Lilith: Mmm, it seems your student has met my strongest protégé. [kneels down] And look at those ears! [Luz covers them, blushing] Is she human? [chuckles and stands] Where did you even find one of these? Okay, Edalyn.

[Lilith traces a spell circle. Around the building, Eda's wanted posters burn.]

Lilith: For one day, you won't have to hide from the law, because I want to see how good a teacher you really are. [walks away]

Eda: Come on, kid. Time to prepare for bloodshed.

Luz: But... whose blood?

Eda: Anyone's guess! [chuckles]

[Luz smiles nervously. Cut to a hallway, where Eda puts a sweatband on.]

Eda: All right, Luz. Let's start your training. Now, I'm coming at you with a blast of fire. What do you do?

[Luz pulls her hood up and leans off of the box she was sitting on, landing on the floor in fetal position.]

Eda: Oh, that's right. I haven't taught you many spells, huh?

[Luz shakes her head.]

Eda: Boy, I hope you didn't make an everlasting oath to stop learning magic or anything. You'd be toast.

Luz: [sits up] I-Is there a glowy hand thing that happens, or, uh--

Amity: Abomination. Rise.

[Lilith and Amity are standing nearby. An abomination that comes up to Amity's shoulders rises from her spell circle on the ground with a groan. It twists its head off and throws it, hitting a bakers coven witch in the face. Tiny Nose grabs his hand and chucks him.]

Tiny Nose: [screams]

Eda: Ooh, boy.

Luz: I can't believe I'm gonna have to stop learning magic!

Eda: Listen to me, Luz. We are not gonna let those snobs win that easy! We are not gonna let them win at all. I've got an idea.

[Her sweatband rips as her hair wins its fight against it. Cut back to the theater. Lilith and Amity are standing on the dais, while Eda and Luz are standing opposite them.]

Lilith: Beloved citizens, the Emperor's Coven proudly presents an impromptu demonstration of the sort of witch we seek every year. Introducing Amity Blight.

[crowd cheers]

Fan: Woo, Amity!

Lilith: Versus...

[Eda steps out of the way and proudly presents a very nervous Luz.]

Lilith: ...some human girl.

[Applause stops]

Student #3: A human?

Student #4: Humans can't do magic!

Student #5: She's not Amity.

[Willow and Gus share a nervous look.]

Luz: Eda? [grabs Eda's arms] What am I going to do?

Eda: Calm down. [frees herself and points] You see those mounds? Get Amity to land on one of those and she'll set off my magic traps.

Luz: That's cheating!

Eda: Nobody will know. To all eyes up there it'll look like you're performing magic. Just trust me.

Luz: But I will know in my heart! Even if I win now, I lose.

Eda: That's the spirit!

[A bell rings and screams. Luz, still nervous, and Amity, confident, approach each other as the audience cheers. Amity cracks her knuckles. Luz waves.]

Amity: [tracing out a large spell circle] Abomination. Rise.

[An abomination that towers over the two girls groans as it rises out of the spell circle.]

Luz: [whimpers]

Amity: [gasps] Whoa. Show me what you got, human!

Luz: I'm not good under pressure! [runs]

[The abomination groans. It twists its head off and throws it at Luz.]

Luz: [panting] Whoa!

[Its head just misses. Luz is backed against the wall by the advancing abomination, its head regrown. She sinks to the ground in fear, whimpering, and grows nervous when she realizes she's right in front of one of Eda's mounds. She braces as the abomination steps on it. The abomination looks down as a towering jet of fire erupts from the mound.]

Amity: How did you do that?

Luz: I, uh-- [she does jazz hands] Magic?

[King scats as he enters the theater, piled high with hats, shirts, buttons, and scarfs.]]

King: ? Things that are free ? ? People are giving offerings to me! ? [reaches Willow and Gus] I love offerings! What did I miss?

Willow: Luz is in a witch's duel!

Gus: Yeah! And she can win it all! Yeah-yeah!

King: Weh?

[The steaming abomination steps onto another mound, this one producing a current of air strong enough to launch it and Amity into the air.]

Amity: [screams]

[The abomination grunts as it lands on its back. Amity lands kneeling.]

Amity: I-I saw you that time! You didn't use your hands! What are you getting at?

Luz: Not dying!

[The abomination sits up with a groan, then stomps toward Luz again.]

Luz: [screams and runs]

[Cut to the stands, where King is carefully making his way down the rows.]

King: This I gotta see!

Student #5: [waving a foam finger] Go Amity!

King: Hey! You root for Luz or nobody!

[He tries to run at the student, but gets caught on his scarf again and falls. Cut back to Luz running from the abomination, which sets off an explosion as it steps on a mound. Cut back to King falling down, his "offerings" falling off as he goes. Cut back to Amity advancing on Luz.]

Amity: How are you doing that?

Luz: [sees the mound] No, Amity, don't step any closer!

Amity: Why, Luz? What happens if I step closer?

[King screams as he falls flat on his back, directly on the mound. Spikes burst from the ground, forcing Luz and Amity back several steps.]

King: Mmm? I'm okay!

Luz: [to Eda] Spikes?

[Eda gives her two thumbs up.]

Amity: I knew it! You were cheating!

Luz: Amity-- No!

[Lilith touches the top of a shorter spike, making it crumble.]

Lilith: Oh, Eda. I do believe this means you lose!

Eda: [groans]

Luz: It wasn't my idea to cheat. And when I found out, I tried to stop it, but--

Amity: Who could believe anything you say?

[Amity starts to walk away. Camera focuses on a power glyph on the back of her neck, which Eda notices.]

Eda: Wait just a sec, Miss Protégé.

[Lilith's eyes widen as Eda goes after her. She lifts Amity's hair.]

Amity: Hey! What are you--

[Eda rips the glyph off. The abomination shrinks until it's about the height of Amity's knee, though it crumbles completely when its head crushes it. Eda holds the glyph up to the audience.]

Eda: A power glyph from the Construction Coven.

[everyone gasps]

Student #1: [gasps] I mean... I knew it.

Willow: [hushed, to Gus] She cheated!

Eda: Ah-ha! Yes, yes, yes-yes-yes! You cheated. Perfect, prissy Lilith cheated. Hot dang, I love coventions! La-la-la--

Lilith: I only did that because I knew you would cheat!

Eda: Still cheated! Welcome down to my level!

Amity: [rubbing the back of her neck] But... I didn't know!

[She sees Luz approaching and runs off.]

Luz: Amity, wait!

King: Luz! Help me!

[Luz grunts as she frees King, ripping the shirts in the process.]

King: My offerings!

Luz: [pats King's head] You'll get more offerings, King. [runs after Amity]

King: Hey, wait for me! [follows her]

[Eda is dancing. Kind of.]

Lilith: Knock it off. You're making a scene!

Eda: You cheated. Hey, where's the Rhyming Coven? What rhymes with "cheated"?

Lilith: Stop acting like a child!

Eda: You were defeated, don't get heated, get your stank face treated.

Lilith: Rhyme one more thing. I dare you!

Eda: Oh, it's okay, I'm done. [pause] Because my rhymes are depleted!

Lilith: [screaming] That's it!

[Lilith summons her staff and hits Eda with a blast of energy, throwing her through her spikes and into the wall behind the dais. The audience gasps.]

Willow & Gus: [gasp]

[The cloud of Lilith's blue magic clears out. Eda, splayed against the wall, smirks.]

Eda: There she is!

[She summons her own staff and spins it in a circle only for it to fly out of her hand and clatter on the ground. She picks it back up with a roar and sends a burst of energy at Lilith. Lilith grunts and sends one back.]

Student #5: Witch's duel!

[Lilith's blue magic and Eda's orange magic are evenly matched. They explode in a white light. Cut to the entrance to the theater, which Luz runs out of and looks around. She sees Amity sulking in a dark corner next to the bathrooms.]

Luz: [gasps] Amity... [walks over] I'm sorry.

Amity: Ugh, seriously? Just leave me alone.

Luz: I didn't mean to embarrass you.

Amity: That's all you ever do! First at school, and now this!

Luz: Yeah, but--

Amity: [stands] You made me look like a fool in front of the Emperor's Coven. My future! You think it's so easy to be a witch. I have been working my whole life to get to the top! [advancing on Luz] You lost! You cheated! Say it! Say you're not a witch!

Luz: [looks at the ground] I'm not a witch.

[She kneels down, pulling out a notepad and pencil. Amity looks confused as she kneels down with her. Luz slowly draws out the light glyph, then taps it. She gently cups the ball of light produced, smiling at it. She holds it up to Amity.]

Luz: But I'm training hard to be one.

[Amity stares at the light in awe. Cut back to Eda and Lilith's duel, where Lilith is spinning her staff. When Eda's attack stops, she pushes her hand forward, her spell circle turning into a burst of magic. Eda takes a few steps back, spinning and drawing a spell circle on the ground. She lifts her hand, creating a growing pillar of wood that splits Lilith's attack. The pillar bends, its owl face hooting lowly. Lilith stares at it, then teleports away from its approaching beak.]

[Stray magic enters the audience. They scream and flee.]

[Two new owl faces extend from the large pillar. Eda draws four more spell circles on the opposite side. Lilith easily teleports away from all of their beaks, destroying one on the ground, then three in the air with a grunt. Eda smirks and spins her staff, creating an orange shield as Lilith hits it with magic and her staff. The shield cracks, but Eda's expression doesn't change. Owlbert's eyes glow. He flies into Lilith's face, interrupting her attack. He hoots and pulls her hair.]

Lilith: Ow, ow, ow-ow-ow. Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

[Eda's shield falls.]

Eda: Say good night, sister.

[She spins her staff and smacks the butt of it into the wooden pillar. A large owl's face forms right next to Lilith, and with a hoot, it captures her in its beak. All falls silent.]

[Owlbert lands back on Eda's staff. She smiles at him, then looks concerned when she sees the flaming hole in the new owl tube's side. Lilith appears directly behind her.]

Lilith: Enough of this.

Eda: [gasps]

[Eda is thrown into the wall with a scream, leaving a crater. Lilith smirks and spins her staff.]

Eda: Lily, wait. The curse.

[Lilith stops spinning her staff, the gathering magic at her palisman disappearing.]

Eda: Look at me. Look at my face. The curse is worsening and I can't keep up with it. I don't know how much time I have left.

Lilith: [approaches Eda] I'll admit I was surprised when I first saw you today.

Eda: I just had to see my sister for... possibly the last time.

Lilith: Eda, I--

[She screams as a bag of Hex Mix is thrown in her face. She stares at it as it hits the ground.]

Lilith: [growls]

Eda: [running for the exit] It's been fun, but let's call it a draw!

Lilith: Argh!

[Cut back to Luz and Amity.]

Amity: [turns away] That's nothing. A child could do a light spell.

[Luz's expression falls. She extinguishes the ball of light and turns away, scooping up her notepad.]

Amity: But... I've never seen it cast like that.

Luz: It doesn't come naturally to me like it does for you, so I've had to improvise. [nods to the notepad]

Amity: [sighs]

[She traces out a spell circle and drags Luz's hand into it. Their hands glow briefly, and the circle disappears.

Amity: The oath is unbound. [lets Luz go and stands]

Luz: Did it work? Can I still learn magic?

Amity: Humans have no magical ability. But I doubt that'll stop you.

[Amity leaves. Luz stands, watching her.]

King: Luz! You left me!

Luz: Yeah, sorry. Your legs are just so tiny. Should we get you more offerings?

King: Nah. That stuff just weighed me down. But I have something for you, Luz. And it's the best thing, because it's free, comes from my heart, and I always have more than I need.

Luz: [gasps] Is it love?

King: Ugh! No! [reaches behind him] Tote bags! [puts it on Luz's arm and hops in it as she stands] And they have so many uses! Away, fair chariot! Away!

[Luz pats his head as Eda arrives.]

Eda: We gotta go.

Luz: How'd you get away from Lilith?

Eda: Let's just say she had a real "snack attack." Hah! [snorts and heads for the door] Wait, I got a better one.

Luz: Eda...

[Eda stops and looks back at her.]

Luz: Do you think I'll ever be a true witch?

Eda: What? I don't know. And who's a true witch? These suckers? According to them, that means being in a coven, but I never joined one and I'm better than all of them combined. You gotta be your own witch.

Luz: [brightens] My own witch.

Eda: Now, let's go before my sister realizes I tied her pointy shoes together.

[Lilith screams]

Eda: And that's our cue! [leaves]

Luz: Sister? Now that's a mysterious past payoff!

Eda: Oh, you think that's all the mystery I got? Wait until you hear about my parents.

Luz: What? You've got parents? I need to know more!

King: You very much don't!

[Cut to a dressing room. Lilith enters, tripping over her tied laces.]

Lilith: [grunts and stands] You make it so hard to want to help you, Edalyn.

[The compact mirror on the counter opens, showing off the insignia of the Emperor's Coven. Lilith gasps.]

Kikimora: [on the mirror] Lilith, I see you let The Owl Lady get the best of your temper. Just remember what Emperor Belos has promised to you.

Lilith: [nods] I will capture her, ma'am. You have my word.

Kikimora: Very good.

[Kikimora fades from the mirror, allowing Lilith's reflection to appear.]

Lilith: Your days are numbered, Edalyn.

Luz: Come on! Work this time. [replicates plant glyph, activates it, gasps when a flower successfully grows] YES! Check it out, King: my glyph skills are blossoming!

King: You think that's impressive? Check this out! Two warriors battling to the death!

[On the phone, two cats meow. One prepares to pounce on the other but falls on its back. Luz looks at the open portal door.]

Luz: Ah. I see we're getting enough Wi-Fi through the portal for cat videos.

King: Senseless violence. Yes, attack! DEATH IS YOUR GOD!

Luz: I regret teaching you about the Internet.

King: Hah! What possible regrets could come from the internet? Oh! Did you know that the Earth is actually flat?

Luz: Yep, that's not right.

[She takes her phone back as it vibrates. She got a text from her mom reading, "How's camp today, cariño? <3, Mamá.]

Luz: [gulps]

[She starts typing "I", then deletes it. "I'm" and "It" are also typed and quickly deleted. She ends up sending a thumbs-up emoji.]

Luz: Good enough.

King: Ah, a severed hand! Perfect response.

[Luz flops down on the couch and puts a pillow on her face.]

Luz: [muffled] Ugh! What am I supposed to say? [sits up; normal] "Hey mom, not at camp actually! I'm in the demon realm learning to be a witch! Also, did you know that demons and magic are real?" She. Will. End me.

King: Nah, she'd be freaked out by our world anyway. So actually, by keeping the truth from her, you're doing her a favor!

Luz: Hm. The demon on my shoulder makes a good point.

King: Always trust a shoulder demon!

[He takes the phone. Hooty opens the door.]

Hooty: Hoot hoot, Luz! Time to fill up that darling little head of yours with... [regurgitates a stack of books onto the ground] Mm-hmm. Delicious knowledge!

[Willow and Gus look in from the doorway.]

Gus: Please hurry!

Willow: The more I look at him, the more uncomfortable I get.

Hooty: HOOT HOOT!

Luz: Hehe. [finger guns her friends; kisses King's head] Don't spend all day watching MewTube, 'kay?

King: I FORGE MY OWN PATH!

[On the phone screen, a fluffy black cat chases its tail. He snickers.]

King: What a dum-dum.

[He's distracted by his own tail wagging. He tries to catch it but flops on the couch after a second.]

King: Ugh. Who has the energy?

[THEME]

[Cut to Hexside. The spider kindergarten teacher decorates the halls with streamers.]

Spider Teacher: Coming through! Watch your heads!

[The halls are decked out with balloons made of abomination goop and other decorations. Luz, Gus, and Willow enter.]

Luz: Something's different today. Did everyone get a haircut?

Willow: Oh yeah! I forgot you've never been here for the social event of the season.

Gus: Welcome to your first--

[Suddenly, two masked health workers enter, rolling a stretcher, making siren noises.]

Worker: Outta the way!

[The workers surround a beast-keeping student with dark skin, blonde hair that covers his eyes, and big, pointy ears similar to a bat. Skara looks on.]

Worker: Come with us immediately! Your disease- it's advancing!

[They help him onto the stretcher.]

Student: Is there a cure, doc?

Worker: Only one... finding the perfect date to Grom!

Student: If that's the cure... then, Skara, will you go to Grom with me?

[He holds out a beating heart, with "GROM?" written on it in red ink.]

Skara: Ahhhhh! Of course I will, or whatever!

[She hugs him, and onlooking students and teachers cheer.]

Luz: [gasps]You guys have a version of prom on the Boiling Isles? I was kicked out of my last school dance for dressing like an otter, but here, I can be your Grom queen!

Willow: That's, uh, not something people usually sign up for.

[Amity enters from behind, looking down at the stack of books and a note she is carrying, and unknowingly bumps into Luz.]

Amity: Watch it, nitwit! Oh. Hi, Luz... and co. Sorry about that.

Luz: No problem, let me help you!

[She helps Amity pick up her books and hands her a little pink note that she dropped.]

Luz: Here, your note.

[Amity snatches it away.]

Luz: Man, you got some quick grabbers.

Amity: It's just, it's... private.

[The speaker screeches on. Everyone looks at it.]

Student #2: I'm so nervous.

Student #3: Shh! This is it!

Principal Bump: [over intercom] Attention Hexside students. This is your principal speaking.

Gus: Oh, man, this is it!

Willow: He's announcing who'll be this year's Grom royalty.

[Amity looks on, concerned.]

Principal Bump: This year, I have the privilege to bestow our highest Grom honor to... Amity Blight!

Willow, Luz, & Gus: [gasp]

[The three of them turn to Amity, who looks shocked.]

Principal Bump: Our Grom queen!

Other Students: [gasp]

Student #4: It's Amity!

Student #5: Amity.

[Amity is noticeably uneasy.]

Luz: WHOOOO! Amity, get it, queen!

[Luz holds her hand up for a high-five. Amity looks around and runs off.]

Luz: Don't leave me hangin'!

Willow: You might want to give her some space. Being Grom queen is a tough job. Even for Amity.

[Cut to the gym. Students are setting up decorations while Principal Bump oversees. The Snaggleback is hanging from the ceiling by a rope and spinning.]

Principal Bump: Very good. Lower the streamers, fill the punch bowl, and- how's my disco ball?

Snaggleback: Nauseous.

Principal Bump: Great. Just keep it up for 36 more hours.

[Principal Bump leaves the gym. Luz enters.]

Luz: Ah. My first school dance experience on the Boiling Isles. I can't wait to get overdressed, take awkward photos, push all the buttons- wait, what?

[She sees a red button on a black-and-red pedestal with insect legs on the bottom.]

Luz: Well, hello. Don't mind if I do.

[She cheekily pushes the button. The ground rumbles, and the floor opens to an underground arena, connected by a ramp.]

Luz: Woah!

[Two walls of weapons come up from the floor on either side of Luz.]

Luz: [gasps] Medieval torture seems like a strange theme for Grom, but hey--

Amity: [offscreen] They're not for decoration.

[Amity is sitting at the top of the bleachers, alone. She stands up and starts to make her way down.]

Amity: This arena's where I'll make my debut as Grom queen.

Luz: Right. Why don't you seem excited?

Amity: [grabs a sword] Because this isn't just some dance party.

[In the arena, black goop rumbles and growls.]

Amity: That's Grom. Short for Grometheus, the Fear-Bringer. It's a monster that lives under the school.

[She casts a spell that shows a tapestry about Grom's backstory.]

Amity: Every year it tries to break out, and a student had to defeat it before it invades the town. Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition.

[The tapestry fades back to the gym.]

Amity: The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shape-shift into your worst fear. And mine... [looks at the blade of the sword] is very embarrassing. [returns the sword]

Luz: If it worries you so much, then why don't you tell Principal Bump you want out of this death match biz? [gasp] Unless talking to Bump is your greatest fear.

Amity: [chuckles] No, but that's a good idea. Thanks, Luz.

[Amity leaves.]

Luz: Hm.

Snaggleback: PUT DOWN A TARP, I'M GONNA PUKE!

[Luz hurries out. Cut to the Owl House, the door to Eda's room.]

Luz: [offscreen] I'm home!

[poking noise]

Eda: [offscreen] OW!

[Luz enters.]

Luz: Guys?

[We see Eda in a brown tuxedo with King, standing on a stack of books, wearing a green apron.]

Eda: Careful with those pins.

King: Why am I doing this? I don't even wear clothes!

Luz: Hey, sweet duds, owl lady! What's the haps? [sits on Eda's nest]

Eda: I'm chaperoning Grom tonight. So I have to look sharp.

King: And Gus asked me to co-emcee the fight!

[King holds up a poster of him and Gus, standing back-to-back in sunglasses, Gus holding a microphone.]

King: We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath!

Eda: Ooh! Have they announced the victim yet?

Luz: Yeah. It's Amity. She's kinda freaking out though. I wish I could, like, take her place or something.

[Eda and King laugh.]

King: A great joke, Luz!

[They continue laughing.]

Eda: Ah, listen, kid. That's a noble sentiment, but Grom is a little above your pay-grade. You're a human. You're... fragile.

[Luz, red with anger, gets up and marches towards Eda.]

Luz: Hey! I've been learning lots of new spells! I could totally handle it.

Eda: There's a horrifying spider in your hair.

Luz: Nope. I'm not as fragile as you think, Eda. And I can't be so easily fooled, either.

[Luz turns around, revealing there is in fact a horrifying spider in her hair. She slams the door as she leaves.]

King: Uh, maybe you were too hard on her. She's saved you from multiple monsters, remember?

Eda: Facing Grom means facing your worst fear, King. And I don't think Luz knows what that means yet.

[She looks at herself in the mirror, pauses.]

Eda: Do you think I could pull off red eyeshadow?

King: Girl, you can pull off anything! Up top! [they high-five] We're style geniuses!

[Cut to the forest. It is dark. Luz is holding a branch and tears through the brush, angry.]

Luz: "Fragile". Eda doesn't know me! I-I'm brave! I'm a bad boy!

[She hears footsteps and yelps.]

Luz: Ominous footsteps, creepy woods. This is no problem.

[She braces for impact and holds up her branch.]

Luz: LUZ CHOP! AAAAAAHHHHHH!

[She lunges forward and unknowingly hits Amity, knocking her down.]

Amity: Ow!

Luz: [gasp]

[Luz pulls out a light-glyph, activating it immediately and holding it up to reveal Amity in the mud.]

Luz: Oh my gosh, Amity! I'm so sorry!

[She tries to help Amity up, though the witch slips in the mud.]

Amity: [sighs] And here I thought this day... Oop!

[Luz pulls Amity to standing. They stare at each other for a second. Amity sits down on a tree stump.]

Amity: ...couldn't get any worse.

[Luz looks around before plopping herself in the mud.]

Luz: Did you talk to Bump? Was it as terrifying as you imagined?

Amity: [sigh] He said no. I'm Grom queen, unless I can find a replacement. And who'd want to switch with me?

[Amity curls in on herself. Luz looks down. Then her face brightens.]

Luz: I would.

Amity: What?

Luz: [stands] Amity Blight, I'll do it. I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena. I'll be your fearless champion!

[The spider that was in Luz's hair crawls onto her face. She screams and faceplants into the mud. Amity looks on, concerned.]

Luz: [weakly] fearless... champion..

[Cut to Luz's room in the Owl House. She rummages through a chest of clothes and pulls out a black dress.]

Luz: Hmmm....

[She pulls out an otter suit.]

Luz: Hmm!

[Her phone buzzes. She picks it up, a text from her mom: "Mira! Visiting our fav after school snack spot !" Then is a selfie of Camila holding a sandwhich outside of a store with a sign reading "Chimichurri Sandwhiches!" Another text reads, "Miss you BEBE! XO" Luz replies "??". She frowns at her phone. Hooty enters.]

Hooty: Oh, Luuuuuzzzz! You have a gueeessssstttt!!

Luz: [tries to hit him] Hooty! No touching!

[Hooty retreats out the window. The door opens.]

Luz: Amity!

[Amity enters through the door, picking feathers out of her hair.]

Amity: If that bird-tube ever talks to me again, I'm going to destroy it. You ready to train?

Luz: [picks up outfits] Which should I wear to Grom? [holds up black dress] This one says, "witch with a dark side." [holds up otter suit, puts on matching smile] But this one says, "I'm an otter... with a dark side."

Amity: Luz, you need to take this seriously. If you can't defeat Grom, everyone on the island will have to live out their worst nightmare.

[Hooty enters, right up against Amity. Amity scrunches her face.]

Hooty: YOU WANNA HEAR MY WORST NIGHTMARE??

[Camera moves outside of Luz's room. Hooty's body writhes as crashes are heard.]

Hooty: Hooty-hoot! Hoot, hoot!

Luz: Stop, stop! Amity, Amity, wai-- AMITY, STOP!"

[Cut to the front of the Owl House, Amity paces in front of Luz, Emira, and Edric. Behind her, Hooty is now wearing an eyepatch and bandages.]

Amity: Grom will transform into your darkest fears. What are you afraid of, Luz?

[Luz thinks.]

Edric: [to Emira] Wanna say our greatest fears? On three. One, two... being alone forever!

Emira: [overlapping] Being stuck with you forever.

Edric: [groans]

Luz: In preparation, I've made a list!

[She pulls a list from her pocket and holds it out to Amity. She grabs it and reads it. Edric and Emira read it, chuckle, and each draw a spell circle. A huge version of Luz's phone appears. The screen shows a guy tipping a white fedora, and a message bubble that says "M'LADY".]

Luz: [yelps] Jerks online who wanna debate!

[A cat with a human face appears.]

Luz: AH!

Cat: Luz, help me! Help!

Luz: Human souls trapped in cat bodies!

Cat: I don't want to be this.

[A carton of milk appears, floating in the air, and pours milk into a glass in Luz's hand.]

Luz: NOOOO! I'm lactose intolerant!

Amity: Not enough. [walks up to Luz as the illusions vanish] The reason I can't face Grom-- it goes deeper than things that just gross me out. [pokes Luz] What's your real fear, Luz?

[Luz looks up at the window into Eda's room.]

Luz: My real fear... is that Eda thinks I'm too fragile to do this! And if she's right, I'll never be a real witch!

[Edric and Emira look at each other and draw a conjoined spell circle. A giant illusion of Eda rises from the ground, flipping her hair. She looks at Luz.]

Eda Illusion: You're inadequate.

[The Eda Illusion draws a spell circle. Luz is put in a high chair with a bib that says "weak baby". Cut to Eda's room, where the real Eda, now wearing a yellow bowtie, looks at herself in the mirror.]

Eda: Me-ow. Still got it.

Luz: [offscreen] Nooooo!

[Cut to Eda exiting the house into the front yard, bowtie in hand. Emira and Edric look proud of their creation while Amity looks nervous. Luz is wailing like a baby.]

Eda: I get it. Ditch the yellow. [gasp] Is that supposed to be me?

[She looks at the illusion of herself, which smiles down at her.]

Eda: Dang, I look great. [chuckle] Wait a sec. You're training to be Grom queen!

Luz: So what if I am! [falls, yelps]

[The high chair and bib disappear as Eda walks up to her.]

Eda: You think training will help against Grom? Luz, you always go overboard and I end up bailing you out. Now, what's the fun in watching a kid get eaten by a monster if it's my kid?

Luz: Well, maybe you'll have fun watching me defeat Grom!

[She karate-chops the cat, and it disappears. Luz grins proudly. Eda looks worried. Amity puts a hand on Luz's shoulder.]

Amity: Luz, I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time.

Luz: I'll take it!

[They smile at each other. Cut to the Hexside gym.]

Snaggleback: Arms so tired.

[Rockabilly-style music is playing in the background. Couples awkwardly dance on the dance floor. Willow dons corsages onto some guests. Eda waits nervously to the side. She looks at her watch, which has King as the arms.]

King: Why so twitchy, witchy? Trying to remember if I've ever seen you this nervous before.

Eda: Well, of course I'm worried! I'm going to have to save Luz from a nightmare monster! Ugh, so much for Mama's fun night out.

[The lights dim.]

Gus: [offscreen] Ladies, gentlemen, and assorted demons!

[Gus is on the stage, in the spotlight, speaking into a microphone.]

Gus: It's almost time for our main Grom event. Please, please, take a seat, and be aware that the first three rows are designated splash zones.

[One guest is sitting in the first row, wearing a raincoat and opening an umbrella. The students cheer. Eda and King sit towards the back.]

King: Wow, Gus is really good at this. They're hanging on his every word!

Gus: [encouraging the crowd to applaud] I see we've got Principal Bump in the house! Now, sir, I hope you won't throw us in detention because, uh, we're going to raise the roof.

[The spotlight goes onto Principal Bump, who is sitting in the bleachers. He makes a raising-the-roof motion with his hands and smiles. The students cheer.]

King: Whoo, I, uh, hope my material's up to snuff. Whoah!

[He drops his card and falls into a sitting position. A whoopie cushion goes off.]

King: What do you think will go better with the youths, close-up magic or impressions?

[Eda grabs King by the collar and holds him up.]

Eda: Oh, King. Teenagers are brutal. They'll boo anyone, and that kind of public humiliation can stick with you for life.

King: Aaahh!

[Cut to the doorway. Amity steps out of the gym and looks around, then down at her note from this morning. She gently smooths it out with her thumb. Luz enters and she quickly pockets the note.]

Luz: I'm not sure if it's nerves or if I accidentally drank some milk, but something's making my stomach squirm.

Amity: Uh, you look nice. Strange, but... nice. [puts her hands on Luz's shoulders] And, thank you, Luz. Honestly, I'm kind of amazed with how fearless you are. You've done things I could never do.

Luz: Hah! Yeah right! You goin' soft on me, Blight?

Amity: [laughs] In your dreams.

[They stare at each other.]

Gus: Now, introducing our Grom queen. You know her, you love her... you've at least heard of her. Luz, the Human!

[The students cheer as the spotlight goes on Luz.]

Luz: [to Amity] Wish me luck!

Amity: [quietly] Luck.

[The pedestal with the red button skitters onto the stage. Gus presses it. The floor opens to reveal the Grom arena. Skara and her date, about to lean in for a kiss, rip off their formal clothing to reveal their Grom jerseys.]

Date: GROM!!!!

Skara: YES, GROM!!!!

[The weapon racks rise up on either side of Luz. She picks up a flail and places an ice-glyph on it. It glows. She ventures into the arena. Grom rises.]

Luz: There you are, Gromarama. Not too scary.

[Grom turns into the human souls trapped in cat bodies.]

Cats: [overlapping] Luz, help me. I'm a man. Make me human again

Luz: Ugh, so weird.

[She swings her flail to gain momentum and slams it to the ground. A pillar of ice rises and rockets out the cats. The students cheer.]

Gus: And there she goes, folks! Using that characteristic human magic to keep Grom at bay! And now, to hand things over to my co-emcee: King!

[The students cheer. King walks onto the stage.]

King: Hel-LO, Hexside! So...

[He drops his cards and the microphone feedback screeches. He tugs at his collar.]

King: Oh, oh gosh. Um... whoooo. Wow, these lights are warm. Observe! Luz, is um... she's down there, all right. And, uh, yes she is! There she goes! Folks, she's battling the thing, and uh...

[The crowd begins to boo.]

Guest: Bring back the funny kid!

King: You will clap for me! Please?

[He throws down the microphone and runs offstage, wailing.]

Gus: King! [goes after him]

[Back in the arena, Luz is fighting the illusion of the online jerks.]

Luz: You're not coming from a place of intellectual honesty, so debating you would be pointless!

[She slams an ice-glyph down, which creates a sharp shard of ice that pierces the illusion and makes it disappear. The students cheer.]

Principal Bump: Luz has lasted surprisingly long. But what form will Grom take next?

Luz: LET'S FINISH THIS! Human-style!

[Grom rises behind Luz, towering over her. An illusion of cursed Eda with glowing eyes creeps towards her. Back in the stands, some kids look at Eda who groans and hides in her hair. The illusion reaches out to Luz's head and makes her eyes glow. It morphs into the portal door. Luz looks at it.]

Luz: Huh?

[The door opens. Camila steps out.]

Grom-Camila: Mija?

[Luz looks on, shocked.]

Luz: Mom! What are you doing here?

[Eda peeks from behind her hair.]

Grom-Camila: Luz, what is this terrible place? Espérate un momento, this isn't camp. Have you been here, all these weeks? [gasps] And is that a weapon?

Luz: Ah! [drops the flail] I can explain!

[The illusion of Camila morphs into Grom. It towers over Luz.]

Grom-Camila: Mija, have you been lying to me?! [growls]

[Luz stares at Grom-Camila, terrified. Cut to the hallway. Gus walks over to King, who is sitting in front of the lockers, looking down. He sits next to him.]

Gus: What's going on, little dude?

King: Nothing! Leave me be! [lays down]

Gus: The thing is, you're sitting in my personal chit-chat zone, which means you gotta talk.

King: Well if that's the rule... Oh, how can this be? I get stage fright! ME! The king of demons!

Gus: Well, sometimes, you just have to--

King: I know, I know. Imagine everyone in their underwear.

Gus: [blushing] GROSS! Why would you do that?!

King: I dunno. I always do that. [chuckle] I am a little weirdo.

Gus: No, King, sometimes you just have to face your fear, like Luz is doing right now.

[Luz slides into the hallway, startled. She runs down the hallway.]

Luz: I can't do it! I can't face my fear!

Grom-Camila: [chasing after her] Why are you running, Luz?

Principal Bump: Grom has escaped.

[Principal Bump and the students move into the hallway.]

Students: He escaped! Oh no! Grom escaped. What are we gonna do?

[Gus stares at the microphone in Principal Bump's hand.]

Gus: King, now's your chance.

[King grabs the microphone as the students chatter.]

King: Gimme! [to himself] King of Demons, you got this. [to crowd] Well, folks, looks like our show literally just took off!

[They look at King, confused.]

King: Weh?

Gus: [to King] You gotta pander.

King: Uh, took off just like your local sports team would take off when they're about to make a goal?

[The students cheer.]

Students: Yeah, sports team! Sports team! Oh, yeah! I love our team!

King: Yeah, that's right, so let's follow them and see what happens next.

[Gus takes King into his arms, and they lead out the crowd. Amity and Eda run out of the gym after them. They nod to each other, determined.]

[Cut to the forest. Luz is running away as Grom follows close behind.]

Luz: I don't wanna be Grom queen anymore! I give up the throne!

[Grom pants. Luz comes up at a cliff and stops just before falling off.]

Luz: [yells]

Grom-Camila: Why can't you face me, Luz? Why can't you face your own mother?

Luz: You're not really my mom! [turns away]

Grom-Camila: How can you say that, cariño?! You're breaking my heart!

Eda: [riding in on her staff] Spicy toss! [hits Grom with a fireball, lands] Hands off my human, you misshapen excuse for a monster!

Grom: [roars]

Luz: Eda! You're right! I'm not ready!

Eda: That's okay, I got this one. [starts casting a spell]

Amity: [makes noise]

Eda: Huh?

[Amity jumps out from the trees and puts herself between Luz and Grom.]

Amity: Stay away from her!

[Grom growls and reaches out an inky arm towards Amity, lifting her high above the ground.]

Amity: I'm sorry, Luz. I should have fought my own battle.

[Grom's eyes glow blue, reading Amity's mind.]

Amity: I-- [eyes glow]

Luz: Amity! No, your fear!

[Grom grows, turning more and more blob-like. Finally, it shrinks and morphs into a humanoid body.]

Luz: Who is that?

[Amity's eyes stop glowing. Grom takes the pink note from Amity's pocket and rips it in half, letting it fall to the ground. Amity closes her eyes, embarrassed, clutching her dress. Grom slinks away. Amity picks up one half of the note from the ground and holds it to her heart. Luz picks up the other, unfurls it, and reads it. It reads, "Will you go to Grom with me? -Amity".]

Luz: [gasps] You were afraid of getting rejected. Amity, it's okay. What if I went to Grom with you instead?

[She holds out her hand for Amity to take. Amity reaches for it.]

Amity: Really?

Luz: That's what friends do.

[Amity smiles, then looks sternly to Grom. It rises and towers above them, roaring menacingly from huge jaws.]

Amity: Well, then, if that's settled, may I have this dance?

[She holds out her hand to Luz. She grins and takes it. They come close to dance, the moon shining brightly behind them. They dance. Luz spins Amity, and Amity casts a spell with her feet, forming a giant abomination below them. They rise up on it. Luz fans out her plant glyph cards. Amity dips Luz, and she slaps a glyph onto the abomination. They jump off, and the abomination goes into Grom's mouth. Green light moves within it, and then plants start to bloom through it. Luz lands, then catches Amity, spinning her around several times before putting her on her feet. As the finish, holding hands, looking at each other, Grom explodes behind them. A giant tree is in its place. The last remnants of Grom slink off. Luz and Amity look up as a tiara appears on both of their heads. They smile at each other.]

Luz: Sooooooo.... who did you wanna ask out?

Amity: [blushing] Oh, its...its not important.

[She pulls the note-piece from her pocket and tosses it aside. It lands right beside the other half, and unfurls to read, "Luz", for a completed message of "Luz, will you go to Grom with me? -Amity". King runs to the side of the girls.]

King: And there you have it, folks. A happy ending for this year's Grom. Let's give a big hand to our Grom queens, Luz and Amity!

[Luz flashes a toothy smile as Amity blushes awkwardly. The students pop out of the bushes and run toward them, cheering. They parade the girls, holding them up. Luz puts a hand on Amity's shoulder. Eda is clapping for them next to Gus and King.]

Gus: You did it, buddy!

King: Of course I did it! I'm the King of Demons and I've never had stage fright in my life!

[The students hold up King, right by Luz and Amity.]

King: THEY LOVE ME!

[Luz and Amity laugh and smile at each other warmly.]

[Cut to the Owl House. Eda, King, and Luz have just arrived home, Luz looking down.]

Eda: WHOOOO! Watch out for this human! Oh, you did good, kid.

Luz: Thanks, but... I'm gonna go to bed.

[She tosses the tiara to the ground. King picks it up and places it on his head.]

King: NOW I AM KING AND QUEEN! Best of both things!

[Luz enters her room with a sigh. She opens the window and sits on the windowsill, looking out.]

Luz: In the end, I couldn't face my mom. Maybe I am fragile.

[Her phone vibrates. She turns it on to find two texts from her mom: "How was your day? ?, Mamá!" and "Miss you mija ??".]

Luz: Hmm.

[She types a duck emoji. Looking into her room, she changes her mind and types out, "Miss you too, Mami". She sends it, then continues typing.]

Luz: [narrating] I won't lie. Today was kinda hard.

[Cut to Willow and Gus poking some remnants of Grom. For Willow, a ladybug pops out, and she jumps back.]

Luz: [narrating] And I don't always feel like I'm supposed to be here.

[When Gus pokes it, a clown pokes out. He runs away. Fade to Amity sitting in her window, looking out of it. She opens a memory box she has in her lap.]

Luz: [narrating] But when things get tough, my friends help me out.

[Amity puts her tiara in the box and closes it. She closes her eyes and leans against the window frame. Fade to the Owl House living room, where Eda is snoring on the couch. King jumps up and lays on her stomach, then falls asleep.]

Luz: [narrating] I think you'd like them.

[Eda wakes up and looks at King. She smiles, puts a hand on his back, and closes her eyes again. Fade back to Luz sitting in her windowsill.]

Luz: [narrating] Te extraño también, Mami. One day, I'll tell you all about this.

[The wind howls, blowing clouds away from the moon. Luz looks out on the sea and smiles. She receives another text from her mom. It reads: "can't wait! P.S. love receiving your letters!"]

Luz: Aw. That's a cute way of saying "text".

[She puts her phone down and looks out at the moon again.]

[The scene fades to Camila lying in bed, smiling at her phone. She turns it off and puts it on her nightstand, next to a pile of actual letters, seemingly written by Luz. Camila turns and goes to sleep. The camera focuses on the top letter, reading, "Hi, Mom! I am having a great time at camp. Today we learned what mortgages are! I can't wait to get home and see you. Let's do lots of fun mother/daughter activities forever and ever. Love, Your Daughter, LUS LUZ"]

[Cut to a photo album titled "Grom Memories". It flips through pictures of the night: A photo of two students posing awkwardly, trying not to touch. Of Skara and her date pushing them out of the way. Of the two with their Grom jerseys. Of Boscha, Bo, and Selene posing. Of them making silly faces. Of Mattholomule photobombing, with the girls looking angry. Of Luz posing in her Grom outfit. Of her looking over. Of only her boot in frame. Lastly, a photo of Luz with her arm around a blushing Amity, Willow throwing peace signs next to them, and Gus posing with his microphone behind them. The book closes.]

[The Snaggleback is still hanging from the gym ceiling. He is holding the album.]

Snaggleback: Wow. What a night. Now, can someone let me down?

[The lights shut off.]

Snaggleback: Anyone...?

Eda: Watch closely, Luz. Hexes Hold'em is the most tricky game on the Boiling Isles. Any proper witch knows how to play.

Luz: Oh boy, cards! The paper rectangles that old people think are fun!

[Eda puts a card down on the table. Lightning comes from the cards, sending Owlbert flying for cover behind the side of the table. The cards all stand and roar. Owlbert's surge forward and attack Eda's, making Owlbert smirk.]

Eda: Now when it looks like the deck is stacked against you, that's when you break out the wildcard.

[She holds up a card with a tower on it. It glows green, and Owlbert's cards disappear in a flash of fire. Fiery letter spelling out "WINNER: EDA" appear and disappear over the table. Owlbert hops back on and hoots at Eda, his wings extended.]

Eda: Woo, I win! In your adorable owl face. Ah, I love the feeling of victory; it feels...fluffy? [feathers are growing from her arms]

Luz: Uh, Eda? It's happening again!

Eda: What's happening again?

King: Your curse is returning!

Eda: [yelps]

[THEME]

[Cut to the inside of a chest as Eda opens it, Luz on one side and King on the other.]

Eda: Oh, boy.

[All of the bottles in the chest are empty.]

Eda: This is terrible. I'm out of elixir.

Luz: Uh, last time this happened, you turned into this thing. [holds up her phone, a picture of the Owl Beast on screen]

Eda: I know I should be repulsed, but that look is fierce.

Luz: Eda!

Eda: You're right, you're right. We need to head to the market.

Luz: Market! [stands and starts to leave]

King: [follows her] I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down!

Eda: Before we go, would anyone like to play one more hand of Hexes Hold'em? [pats her pocket] Hey, where are my cards?

Luz: [handing the deck to Owlbert] Take these and fly ahead. She'll have to follow us.

[He does]

Eda: [running after him] Owlbert, you sore loser, gimme back my cards!

[Cut to the Bonesborough sky line as a winged demon flies past. Cut to the market, where Eda bangs on a metal grate.]

Eda: Hey, open up, Morton!

Morton: Uh, ju--...just a minute!

[King leaves Eda's side to sit next to Luz on a bench.]

Luz: Is there anything better than people watching in the Demon Realm?

[Three witches are standing at a bus stop as a giant egg rolls up to it. The egg cracks, revealing a featherless bird that screeches. It flies away. The witches enter the egg, one of them closes it, and it rolls off as Tiny Nose runs up.]

Tiny Nose: Wait, wait! Aw, dang it.

Luz: The curse of tiny legs.

King: I know the pain.

[loud footsteps]

Tiny Nose: [screams and runs]

[A witch waves his hand, and a cart with a large demon on it follows him. Luz walks up to Eda.]

Luz: Whoa, that is one ominous parade.

Eda: That's no parade. Those are demon hunters.

[The demon growls and bucks. The two demon hunters pushing the cart pull its ropes to pin it back down. It tries to bite at the first demon hunter.]

Eda: Dangerous nomads who capture and sell the most powerful beasts.

[The first demon hunter traces a spell circle, creating lightning in his hand. He grunts as he shocks the demon unconscious. He turns and looks at Luz.]

Luz: [gasps]

Eda: ...Which I'm about to become if you don't open up, Morton! [continues knocking on the grate]

Morton: [opens the grate] Sorry, Eda! I was up all night poison tasting and for some reason I don't feel great.

Eda: I'm all outta my juice, pal.

Morton: Oh, gee. Lemme see what I can do.

[Morton ducks down and digs around, rattling bottles. The demon hunters continue on, revealing Willow and Gus, looking dejected, behind the demon.]

Luz: Willow and Gus! [runs up to them] Heya, friends! Wait, what's wrong? Who hurt my babies?

Willow: Them.

[She points to a food stand. Skara and Cat are laughing while Amity is staring at a potion and Boscha is watching them.]

Willow: Amity's having a moonlight conjuring and invited everyone but me.

Gus: And she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account.

[Gus summons his scroll, open to Amity's Penstagram post of her and her friends posing.]

Luz: "It's conjuring night! No dorks allowed"? What a jerk! [scowls for a second] What's a moonlight conjuring?

Willow: You spend the night at someone's house, telling stories, playing games...

Luz: Like a slumber party! We have those!

Willow: [pulls out a book] Then you bring something to life with moon magic!

Luz: [pauses] Like a weird slumber party!

Willow: Gus and I have never been to one. You need at least three people and--

Luz: I'm three people-- I mean, we're three people, and we're way better than them!

Boscha: [laughs as they all approach] Sorry you couldn't get an invite to the conjuring, Willow. [looks at Amity] Only real witches allowed.

Amity: [sighs] Leave her alone. It's not her fault she was born without talent.

[They all leave.]

Willow: [growls, grows several vines from the ground]

Luz: Whoa. [slaps the tallest vine, hugs Willow] Don't waste your time getting thorny over them. 'Cause we're gonna have our own moonlight conjuring.

Gus: Are you serious? This was on my bucket list. [pulls it out and checks it off] After owning a real human bucket!

Luz: That's a really weird thing to want, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'll go tell Eda.

[She runs to get Eda. Cut back to her and Morton.]

Morton: I've got bad news and good news. Bad news is I'm all out 'till next week. Good news is feathers are a good look for you.

[A feather grows out of her hair.]

Eda: Morton!

[That feather and several others flutter to the ground as she stalks forward.]

Morton: Well gee, E. Why'd you wait to re-up 'till now?

Eda: I've been very busy.

King: [from the bench] Yeah, busy playing Hexes Hold'em. She's obsessed with it.

Eda: I am not obsessed!

King: You're playing it right now!

[Several cards are now splayed out on the counter, and Eda has one in hand.]

Eda: ...Am I winning?

Morton: You know, I wouldn't suggest this to just anybody, but if you need your elixir you can try your luck later this evening.

Eda: In the night market?

Morton: There's a guy with a stand, goes by Grimm Hammer; if anyone has what you need, it's him.

Luz: Eda, Gus and Willow and I are gonna do a moonlight conjuring and stick it to Amity. So can we--

Eda: [grabs her staff and starts walking] Not tonight, I'm going out. I need you to watch the house, I have many precious objects in there.

King: Like me! Whoa!

Eda: [picks King up by his collar] You're coming with me. I need an extra pair of eyes looking out for pickpockets, and an extra pair of hands in case I want to pickpocket.

Eda & King: Pickpocket!

Luz: Then, maybe they can come to the house and--

Eda: No! Besides, conjurings are dumb; sitting in a circle holding hands. Pft. It's like magic for babies. [walks away]

Luz: But--

[Willow and Gus run up.]

Willow: Luz! What did Eda say?

Luz: So...guys...

Gus: Oh, look! [points upwards] The moon is rising into place. And the celestial powers only align once a year.

Willow: Oh, I can't believe I finally have enough friends for a moonlight conjuring! Thank you, Luz! Did Eda say it was okay?

Luz: Uhm...yes. She said yes. We can do it at the Owl House. As long as we don't make a mess or touch anything and never bring up that we did it! [nervous laugh]

Gus: Yes!

Willow: Oh, you're the best!

Willow & Gus: [singsong] We're gonna do a conjuring! We're gonna do a conjuring! Conjuring! Conjuring!

[Luz looks at the moon nervously.]

[Cut to the Owl House that night, where crickets are chirping. Luz is sitting on the couch watching Eda.]

Eda: Luz, you're in charge while I'm out. [puts cloak on] Make sure Hooty doesn't get into any trouble.

Hooty: [muffled] Hoot hoot! [opens door] I don't need a babysitter. I'm a big boy house!

Luz: You can count on me; I'd never betray your hard-earned trust. [nervous laugh]

Eda: You're acting suspicious. You're doing that thing where you hide in your hoodie.

Luz: [now has her hood up and closed] Meow I'm not. Uh... [pushes hood down] Oh, where's King?

Eda: He's right here.

[She opens her cloak to reveal King, snoring, strapped in a pink baby carrier.]

Eda: His little body just conks out when he's weightless. Look at this.

[She moves side to side, King not waking as he moves like a ragdoll.]

Luz: Aww, he's so dangly. [plays with his feet]

Eda: [walks outside] Anyway, really going now. And Luz...

[Luz grows nervous.]

Eda: [menacing tone] ...if you mess up the house, I will never trust you again. [lighter tone] No pressure! Bye!

[Owlbert hoots as Eda flies away. Luz waves after them for a few seconds.]

Luz: Ay. Should I really be doing this? No, no, Willow is counting on you. [whispering] Okay, she's gone.

Willow: Release!

[Two bushes glow and explode, revealing Willow and Gus in their casual clothes.]

Willow: I'm a sneaky sneakster!

Gus: I've got leaves in my pants...and I like it.

[Luz leads them inside.]

Hooty: Company! Hooray! Finally someone to listen to my stories! Okay, one time, a sparrow flew into my mouth, and then I--

[door shuts]

Hooty: Hey...

[He coughs out a sparrow, which flies away chirping. Cut to inside.]

Luz: Welcome to, the living room. We call it that because it's technically living! The walls are breathing, look.

[A wall is moving with heavy breaths. Willow looks at it closer.]

Willow: Enchanting.

Gus: [rummaging through a chest] And look at all these human treasures. [pulls out a skull] And actual humans!

Luz: We've got snacks, we've got weird music!

[She puts the needle down on a gramophone, which produces an evil cackle. Gus walks up to her with a bucket on his head.]

Gus: We've got a bucket!

Luz: Gus, my man.

Willow: And best of all we have actual friends to do the conjuring with! This is so exciting!

Luz: So how does this conjuring stuff work?

Willow: Well first, we find something to animate. Since it's our first time we should pick something meaningful. [walks over to some flowers] Something beautiful.

Gus: [bursts through the flowers with an action figure] Like this strangely buff little man? [taps the figure's stomach]

Beefy Bob: I'm half beef, half Bob!

Luz: Yes! He's perfect!

Willow: That's not exactly what I meant by "beautiful".

[Gus lowers the action figure, whimpering and looking hurt.]

Willow: Okay, buff boy it is.

Luz: Yes! [hugs Willow]

Gus: Tonight he shall be risen!

[Cut to the moon rising in the sky. Gus places Beefy Bob on the ground between the three of them. There are several lit candles around them.]

Willow: According to the conjuring books I've read, we say the incantation and make a connection with the doll.

[They all hold hands.]

Gus: Figurine.

Willow & Gus: Moonlight, we call, we sing. Moonlight take this chance. Moonlight come tie the string. Moonlight start the dance!

Luz: Moonlight tie... string... and I don't know the words!

[The moon continues rising. Hooty looks up at it. The moon stops moving, and a burst of blue light comes out of it. A similar burst of blue light bursts out from between Willow, Luz, and Gus, spreading around the living room and extinguishing the candles. They all open one eye and look at Beefy Bob.]

Gus: That's your cue, little man.

[The entire house rumbles. Hooty blinks, his eyes turning the same blue. ]

Hooty: [ghostly noises]

[Birds fly away from the house while cawing. The foundation cracks as the Owl House rises. The three kids scream as they loose their balance. The Owl House stops rising, now standing on giant bird legs. Cut to the living room, now in great disarray.]

Luz: Guys? [a book falls on her head] Did the entire house just hiccup?

Gus: Little buff guy, what did you do?

Beefy Bob: A real man never takes accountability!

Willow: No, I think-- I think we might've animated the house by accident!

Luz: The house?

Hooty: [ghostly noises]

[Luz runs outside and nearly falls off the ledge. Gus and Willow join her outside as the House begins to walk. They all scream. The door slams shut.]

Luz: [running up to the door] Hooty? Hooty! Hooty, you have to stop!

Hooty: By the power of moonlight, I have risen. Hoot hoot.

Gus: He's in some kind of trance!

[The House steps through two trees. The jostling makes Gus yell as he and Luz lose their balance. He nearly falls off, but Luz and Willow catch him.]

Willow & Luz: Gus!

Willow: Our magic must've spread through the house instead of the doll!

Gus: Figurine!

[Luz and Willow grunt as they try to not drop Gus. They both nearly fall and grab the other's hand for balance. The glow returns.]

Luz: Hooty, stop!

[The House stops moments before it would have walked off a cliff. Luz and Willow pull Gus back up to safety and they all let go of each other, staring at their hands.]

Gus: How'd we do that?

[They all look at the moon.]

Luz: Willow, Gus, hold hands again.

[They do, glowing once again. The Owl House takes several steps away from the cliff.]

Willow: We're controlling it with the power of friendship. Uh, and the moon. Probably the moon.

Gus: This is amazing! What do we do now?

[The glow fades.]

Luz: On the one hand, we should probably stay put.

Gus: On the other hand, we've got a giant walking house and should totally take it on a joyride!

[Luz looks at the now-descending moon.]

Luz: Okay, okay, but we gotta be back before the moon sets or Eda will kill me.

[Cut to them directing the house forward, cheering.]

Gus & Luz: Yeah! Joyride!

Demon Hunter #1: [growls]

[Cut to a sign that reads "NIGHT MARKET," behind a pair of pikes with skulls on them. Every stand at the market is bathed in red light. Eda walks through the center passage of the market before stopping.]

Eda: [sighs, covers the feathers that grew] The curse. I need that elixir. Quick. [sees a demon sitting next to a crate] Hey, you. You know where I can find a Grimm Hammer?

[The demon nods with a grunt. A smaller lizard-like creature pops out of its eye socket and points to a foreboding stand. Eda approaches it. The demon eats the lizard. Cut to the Owl House, still walking through the forest. Boscha walks past with a crow phone and a duffel bag.]

Willow: Hey, is that...

Gus: It's Boscha. That girl who made fun of us.

Boscha: [to the crow] Ugh! Yes, Mom. I'm going to a moonlight conjuring. No, Mom. You can't come. And yes, Mom, it's sad that you're asking.

[She lets go of the crow, which caws as it flies away. She turns around and sees the Owl House.]

Willow: She noticed us. What do we do?

Luz: Hmm. [to Boscha through a megaphone] Hey. H-Hey you. You should, uh, stop being so mean to people. You're kind of a jerk.

[all laugh]

Boscha: Ew. A talking house is giving me a lecture? Whatever. I'll just TP you like I did with the rest of the neighborhood.

Luz: But don't you see? I am no mere house.

[The House stands as Luz roars. Boscha screams and runs away. The other three laugh.]

Gus: I've never pranked anyone before. And now I have a taste for it.

Willow: We should follow her to Amity's house to show off our conjuring. That will show her who's got no talent.

[Luz looks at the moon, which is nearly at the treetops and still going down.]

Luz: Actually, I'm starting to think we should head back.

Gus: Amity's updating her Penstagram.

Luz: "Shout out to my fellow witches. #Humans can bite it." [gasps] Let's do it.

[The House continues walking as they all cheer. Several shadowed figures fly after them. Cut to Eda approaching the stand and peeking through its curtain.]

Eda: Hello? Uh, I seek the one they call Grimm Hammer.

Tibbles: [ominously] I'm the one they call Grimm Hammer.

[The curtains raise. A pig demon jumps onto the counter.]

Tibbles: [normal voice] Welcome, welcome, welcome. I've got weaponry from the Hinterlands, curses from the Winterlands, and jelly beans.

[He tosses the jelly beans like confetti. King reaches for them and catches one.]

King: Jelly beans!

Tibbles: They're lethally delicious.

[King opens his mouth to eat it anyway. Eda knocks it out of his hand.]

Eda: You are Grimm Hammer?

Tibbles: Tibblet-Tibblie Grimm Hammer the third. Please, call me Tibbles.

King: [laughs] He wants to be called that.

Eda: Okay, Tibbles. I need some of this elixir. [hands him an empty bottle]

Tibbles: Oh. This is one wicked brew. Lucky for you, [grabs one with his tail] I just stocked up.

Eda: Huzzam! I'll give you ten snails.

Tibbles: Add two more zeros and it's a deal.

Eda: A thousand snails? What kind of game are you playing?

Tibbles: Capitalism. Where everyone wins, [goes further into his stand] except you.

Eda: Hey! [notices a deck of cards] Say, you play Hexes Hold'em?

King: Really? Now?

Tibbles: Oh! Is that what that game is called? [chuckles and returns to the counter] I was just using these as coasters.

Eda: How about we make it interesting? I win, you give me the elixir. You win, you can take something of mine.

Tibbles: Oh, what fun. You're on.

[Eda smirks. Cut to Bonesborough, through which the Owl House walks. People on the streets scream and run for cover. Cut to a large manor with a gate reading "BLIGHT MANOR" in front of it.]

Willow: Look, Amity's house. Time to show Amity what a real conjuring looks like.

[The House starts forward, but is stopped by a giant rope over the roof.]

All: Wha--

Willow: What happened?

Luz: Is that a... giant crossbow?

[Demon Hunter #1 gives the signal for the crossbow to be shot. A second giant bolt and rope secure the house further. Demon Hunter #1 jumps up in front of the kids.]

Demon Hunter #1: Knock, knock.

[all gasp]

[Cut to the Owl House tied down a large cart being pushed through the woods by demon hunters. One stands atop a cliff and blows into a horn. Cut to the front door, Hooty making strange noises as Luz, tied to Willow and Gus inside, kicks at it.]

Luz: Hooty! Hooty! You have to wake up!

Hooty: If you want this to end as you say, three must hold hands. It's the only way.

Luz: ¡Oye, no me hable así! Willow, will you help me out with Hooty?

Willow: I'm sorry, Luz. You shouldn't ask me to help with anything.

Luz: Willow.

[All scream and grunt as the House stops moving.]

Luz: Did the house stop moving?

Gus: Uh, my insides didn't.

[The door squeaks open, making the three of them whimper.]

Demon Hunter #1: [laughing]

[Cut to the demon hunter shoving the three of them out of the Owl House.]

All: Ow! Ow! Ow! [all scream, grunt]

Demon Hunter #1: Take the house and rip out the house demon. We can sell it to restaurants as exotic meat.

Luz: No! Hooty would taste terrible.

Hooty: Hey, I'm a refined taste. Hoot! Hoot!

Demon Hunter #3: What do we do with the worms?

[Luz looks at her friends.]

Demon Hunter #1: Throw them over the cliff.

Demon Hunter #3: [chuckles as he approaches them]

Gus: [whimpers]

Demon Hunter #3: All righty, kids. Here's the end of your short little lives.

[He shoves them to the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea.]

Gus: [groans] Wait! Wait! Wait! [turns the group so he's facing the demon hunter] Is this really what you wanna be doing with your life? Tossing kids from cliffs?

Demon Hunter #3: Actually, yes. It's been my dream since I was a boy.

[The three of them look at him for a long moment.]

Demon Hunter #3: I was a strange child. Whee! [shoves them and laughs]

[all scream]

[Cut to the three of them dangling from a branch sticking out of the cliffside.]

Luz: If we're not killed now, we will be when Eda finds out about the house.

Willow: Luz, I'm so sorry. You wanted to turn back but I just had to show off to Amity. The truth is she and I used to be friends.

Luz: Whaaat?

[The branch cracks.]

Willow: We played together as kids, but when she got her magical powers and I didn't, she stopped hanging out with me.

Gus: Guys, is now the best time?

Willow: [sighs] I just wanted to prove to her that I was a powerful witch, too.

Luz: That's ridiculous. You helped bring a house to life. Amity doesn't know what she's talking about.

[Willow smiles]

Luz: Next to Eda, you're the most powerful witch I know. No offense, Gus.

Gus: No, not at all. I know what I'm about.

[The branch cracks and they all yelp.]

Gus: This tree can't hold us much longer.

Willow: [grunts as she frees a hand] There. Now, if I could just reach that root. Gotcha!

[Her hand glows green as she grabs it. Cut to the Night Market, and a flaming pile of Hexes Hold'em cards.]

King: Oof. That was painful to watch.

Eda: You card shark. You hustled me.

Tibbles: [chuckles] Looks like you forgot about my wild card.

[His wild card hops out of his hand onto the counter.]

Card: [growls and rips shirt] Yeah!

Tibbles: In any case, I'd like my prize now. And I choose... the little bone boy. [chuckles and takes King] I've always wanted a tiny servant to model my line of baby clothes.

King: No! I don't look good in clothes. I'm all-natural. Eda, do something!

[Eda twirls her finger, but no magic comes out of it. Her arm erupts in feathers.]

Eda: [grunts] I can't perform magic.

[Tibbles snaps his fingers, and magic chains burst out of the ground to wrap around Eda. She falls to the ground.]

Eda: You think this can stop me? I can still bite your ankles.

Tibbles: You don't think I know who you are? Eda, the Owl Lady.

Eda: [gasps]

Tibbles: That's right. [pulls out her wanted poster] I've seen your wanted posters around here. I wonder how much the Emperor's Coven would pay me to hand you over?

[Eda glares at him. Cut to the cliff with the Owl House.]

Demon Hunter #3: Yeah, they tried to fight back and they nearly got me. But you know, I handled it.

Demon Hunter #1: They were children, Tom.

[A shadow falls over them. Willow has made the small root grow into a huge plant, and she, Luz, and Gus are standing atop a leaf. She moves one of the thorny vines to cut the rope and free them.]

Willow: We may be children, but we're also witches. Powerful ones.

[She sets the plant to attack. It flings Tom into the distance. Demon Hunter #1 pulls a sword and slices off the tip of one of the vines. A three-eyed witch tries to hit a vine with an axe, but misses. The vine grabs their ankle and flings them into a pile of rubble. Willow, Luz, and Gus run to the House while the plant is busy with the other demon hunters. Luz holds open the door for them, then closes it behind her.]

Luz: Everyone, quick!

[They join hands. Cut to Demon Hunter #1 cutting through a vine with a shock spell. As he does, the Owl House stands.]

Demon Hunter #1: [lifting his eyepatch] Uh...

[The House steps forward, crushing him. Cut to the moon, now on the water.]

Luz: Oh, no. I don't mean to step on this victory but we gotta get home before Eda does.

[The Owl House walks away, leaving the ruins of the battle behind.]

Demon Hunter #1: [groaning]

Demon Hunter #3: "They're just children, Tom."

[Cut to the Night Market, where Eda is still chained up on the ground, and King is sulking in a sailor's outfit.]

Eda: King, I'm sorry.

King: King? Who's King? I go by Little Bone Boy now.

Eda: I know I have a problem. I get obsessed with Hexes Hold'em. But I'm done with that stupid game. Look. [eats a card]

King: You promise?

Eda: [muffled] I promise.

King: [chuckles] Okay, okay. [kicks off the ankle chain] I'll grab you the elixir and then we can bust out of here.

Tibbles: Bone boy!

King: Heh?

Tibbles: You will do no such thing. The Emperor's Coven is already on its way to send this witch here to the Conformatorium. [holds up an outfit] And I just rustled up some more clothes for you to try on. [chuckles]

King: [throws hat on counter] Just because I have a model's body doesn't mean you can use me like this.

[Loud footsteps make a candleflame waver.]

Tibbles: [climbing onto the counter] I can and I am, bone boy. I've got the cards stacked against you.

[loud footsteps]

Tibbles: And nothing can stop me. Nothing!

[One of the Owl House's feet steps directly through Tibbles's stand. A bottle of Eda's elixir falls on the ground, intact.]

Luz: [waving out the window] Sorry, mister.

[The House continues down the street. Eda sits up and laughs. King backs away from Tibbles.

Eda: Wait, what-- Was that my house?

King: Eda, quick!

[He tosses her the elixir. She catches it in her mouth and downs it, then spits the bottle out. She traces a spell circle that makes the chains explode, and her feathers poof off her arms.]

Tibbles: No, no, no! My scam stand.

Eda: Sorry, Tibbles, old boy. It looks like you forgot about the wild card.

[She grabs her staff and throws cards at Tibbles. Her and King leave]

Tibbles: Curse you, witch. Curse you, bone boy. I'll have my revenge. Tibblet-Tibblie Grimm Hammer the third will have his revenge.

[Tibbles's stand falls apart. Cut to the usual location of the Owl House as it sits down in the crater it left. Cut to the living room, where Luz opens one eye.]

Luz: Did we do it?

Hooty: [opens door] Is the room spinning or is it just me? [chuckles] Ah. Just a little house humor. Ooh.

Luz: Sorry about all that, Hooty.

Hooty: It's okay. I'm just glad I was included.

[The door is slammed closed, revealing Eda and King on the other side.]

Luz: Oh, boy.

Eda: You are so busted.

Luz: Oh, man.

Eda: You held a moonlight conjuring.

Luz: I did.

Eda: And you animated my house. My house!

Luz: Yes.

Willow: [stepping in front of Luz] No. Don't punish Luz. We're the ones who pushed her to do the conjuring.

Gus: [stepping in front of Willow] If you're gonna eat me just do it now. Do it now!

[Eda looks disgusted at the idea.]

Luz: [to Willow] Hey, you didn't have to do that.

Willow: Yes, Luz. I did.

Eda: Well, you're all guilty, so you'll all be punished by cleaning my house top to bottom.

[She summons various cleaning supplies that land in the kids' arms.]

Eda: And another thing...

[all gulp]

Eda: That was totally amazing. And I'm so joining you for next year's conjuring. Now get to work.

[The three of them run off. Eda flops onto the couch]

King: I can't believe they animated a whole house.

Eda: Yeah. You're right. That takes some powerful magic.

Luz: [to Willow] You know, I still kinda wish we got to show up Amity.

Willow: Yeah. Too bad no one will know of our daring adventures.

[Cut to Amity's bedroom, where a stuffed rabbit is sitting on the floor. Boscha, Cat, Skara, and Amelia are all glaring at it.]

Boscha: Ugh. So what if we couldn't move a doll. Now we have time for what really matters. Penstagram.

[She summons her scroll. The other three summon theirs a few seconds after. Cut to Amity brooding, looking out of her window. Boscha gasps, getting her attention. She walks over and looks at Boscha's scroll. Her Penstagram feed has several people's posts showing off Willow, Luz, Gus, and the animated Owl House. Amity and Boscha share a look.]

Amity & Boscha: WHAT??

[crows cawing]

Eda: Well, Luz! [elbows her] Did you ever in your life think you'd see something as breathtaking as this?

[She gestures to the corpse of a trash slug that towers over them. It's surrounded by trash and muck. Flies audibly buzz around the corpse.]

Luz: [shaking her head] I don't like this. [She plugs her nose.]

Eda: [walks to the trash slug] Yes, it doesn't get much more inspiring than the trash slug. It makes a home, a life from what others have thrown by the wayside. [pulls a rubber chicken from the trash slug's mouth] Until, blam, it gets blasted by a wave one day and croaks from all the salt. And then we get to sell the stuff it ate. [She pulls out a pickaxe.]

Luz: Please don't make me.

King: [walking away] Aw, come on, Luz. [unfurls a towel] It's not every day you get to go to the dump and pick apart a garbage carcass.

Eda: Ah, nuts to you both.

[Eda swings the pick at the trash slug.]

Luz: So, Eda...

[Glass shatters]

Luz: What if we tried some new lessons for my apprenticeship? Like...

[Something crashes.]

Luz: Read ancient scrolls or mix together potions, or-

Eda: [while tossing things from the trash slug's mouth] Ugh. That sounds like a bunch of magic school stuff.

Luz: Wait. Is there a magic school here? Like, winding towers, cute uniforms, dark plots that threaten your life kind of magic school?

Eda: Mm-hmm. What's worse, they force you to learn magic the "proper" way. But magic isn't proper. It's wild and unpredictable. And that's why it's so beautiful. I didn't finish school, and look at me! Who wouldn't envy where I am right now?

[Flies are flying around the pile of trash Eda is currently standing in. Luz's expression falls.]

Eda: Uh... Hey, here's a lesson. [drops her pick] A great witch is resourceful, [sticks Luz's hand in a puddle of trash slug bile] like this.

[Eda drags Luz's hand back and forth before letting go. Luz continues digging until she pulls something out.]

Luz: Oh, hey. Greasy slime ball.

Eda: [closes Luz's hands around the slime ball] Use your slime ball wisely, young witch. [stands and heads back for the trash slug] Back at it! We'll hit the stink nodes first.

Luz: Actually, if it's okay, [starts backing away] I think I'll head home and look at pictures of animals that are still... alive. Love you, King. [pets his belly]

King: [giggles]

Luz: You little beach peach. [continues walking into the woods]

King: [sighs]

Eda: [shrugs] More for me, then.

[She climbs into the trash slug, sending several things clattering.]

Eda: There we go. Okay.

[She tosses out a cheese grater, an electric fan, and a tuba, the last of which lands on King's head.]

King: Ow! [struggles to free himself]

Eda: This is awesome!

[THEME]

[A monster that looks very distantly related to a butterfly flies across the woods, panting. Luz walks down the path, glaring at the slime ball.]

Luz: Ugh! If magic's all about digging for slime balls, maybe I don't have the stomach for it. [pockets the slime ball]

Girl's voice: You can do it! You can!

Luz: [looks around] Mysterious voice of encouragement? [looks through bushes and gasps] No! Little witch girl.

Girl: [stands to pace around] You can do it. Even if you get a bad grade, it's not a reflection of you as a witch. And my parents are right. [stops pacing] There are better opportunities on this track. Now, get to school! [steps forward and points confidently, but gets sad when she realizes she stepped on a flower] Oh, no! Oh, little friend! I'm sorry!

[She kneels down and repeatedly traces a spell circle. The flower perks back up and fully blooms.]

Luz: [gasps]

[The girl's ear wiggles as something rumbles off screen. She turns as a wagon, being moved by magic, rolls to a stop in front of her, carrying a pot and a girl reading a book.]

Amity: [looks away from her book] Willow! Wow. [hops off the pot] You're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into ya. [chuckles]

[The flower that Willow just healed wilts.]

Willow: Hi, Amity. [stands up]

Amity: Uh, shouldn't you get to class early to prep your...

[Rattling cuts her off. They turn to Willow's pot as it spills, pouring out a purple substance and an eyeball that blinks and groans.]

Amity: Oh, Willow. You don't have anything to show, do you?

Luz: Witch drama!

[Willow pulls up her hood as she blushes.]

Amity: [sighs] This is why people call you "Half-a-Witch Willow."

[rattling]

Amity: Oh, looks like someone wants to say something to you. [takes the cover off her pot] Abomination, [snaps] rise.

[Her abomination rises, becoming more solid until it's humanoid in shape. It bends out of the pot to poke Willow's forehead, leaving behind mud in a star-shape.]

Abomination: You're a... star.

Amity: Aw. It's like mine. [readjusts a star shaped badge that reads "Top Student"] But much smaller and meaningless. As top student, it's my duty to tell you to keep at it. [puts an arm around Willow] Even you could get a passing grade someday. Abomination, cower.

[It groans as it melts back into the pot. Amity replaces the pot lid and takes hold of the cart.]

Amity: See you in class, superstar.

[Amity walks away. Willow removes her hood. As Amity leaves, Luz sticks her tongue out at her.]

Willow: "Oh, see you in class, superstar!" [wipes the star from her forehead] I hate when she does that.

[Luz flinches as she watches. Wind blows leaves around Willow as she rants.]

Willow: I hate making abominations. I hate getting bad grades. Ugh! I can't stand this anymore. [shouts, her eyes glowing green]

Luz: [gasps]

[The flower from earlier gets lost among giant thorny roots that burst out around it. They surround Willow, glowing and writhing angrily. One snakes out and grabs Luz by the ankle.]

Luz: [screams]

[The root drops Luz on the ground a bit behind Willow, who turns and glares at her, her eyes still glowing. Cut back to the beach, where Eda is tying a sack to her staff as King watches.]

Eda: Not a bad haul. That oviduct was loaded.

King: Ah. Lose apprentice, gain garbage eggs. Fair trade.

Eda: [scoffs] I didn't lose anything.

King: If you don't teach Luz right, you will. And that's when I come in, make her my apprentice.

Eda: Ha! And what would you teach? How to get stuck in the arm of a sweater?

King: Hey, that only happened once! I'd teach her about demons. How to identify them, talk to 'em, raise an army with them and tear apart the world!

Eda: After they tear you out of the sweater arm, right?

King: You think you're so smart! Well, [hops off the trash he's sitting on toward Eda] why don't we make a little bet where I can prove that I'd make a better teacher.

Eda: Okay. [reaches into her hair] I'm obligated to remind you that I only use our bets to utterly humiliate you. [pulls out a book called "Eda + King One Sided Wagers"] And... [opens it] that you've never won.

King: I like those odds.

Eda: So how's this? [grabs an egg] Teach this trash slug to be your loyal soldier in one day. Prove that you can be a better teacher than me, and Luz is all yours. But if you don't, I change your name from King to... Mr. Wiggles.

King: Well, when you lose, you'll have to... wear a shame hat and sleep in a shack and never come into the Owl House again! Ha!

Eda: Deal.

King: [squeaks as he stamps his paw to a page]

[Eda tosses the egg at King's head, breaking it and leaving a baby trash slug between his horns. It slips down his skull, but King catches it. It coos at him.]

Eda: [walking away] Ha ha!

[Cut back to the forest, where Luz is watching in awe as the roots are still writing around Willow. She finally seems to snap out of it, leaning forward worriedly and letting the roots fall.]

Willow: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I'm so sorry! [makes the roots still wrapped around Luz's legs retreat]

Luz: [rubs her leg] It's okay. The thorns only went through a few layers of skin.

[Willow gets very close to Luz, forcing her to lean back a bit.]

Willow: So... circly.

Luz: [squeals and covers her ears]

Willow: [gasps] You're human! This is astounding! [gasps and grabs Luz's face, then helps her stand and walks around her] A human on the Boiling Isles! How'd you get here? What are you doing here?

[bells pealing]

Willow: [flinches and puts Luz's arm down] Uh, I'm sorry. I can't stay. I have to go disappoint my teacher. It was nice to meet you, human. [walks away, half-waving]

Luz: [half-waves back, then rushes after her] Wait! I'm Luz. And you're Willow, right? What you did with that flower and those plants, it was... wow.

Willow: Thanks, but... I'm not even supposed to be doing plant magic. My parents put me in the abomination track at school.

Luz: [squeals, grabbing Willow] Like, magic school?

[Willow nods.]

Luz: That's so cool! [lets Willow go] I'm so jealous. I have a teacher, but her lessons are a bit... untraditional. I bet she wouldn't even let me enroll. But I wish I could spend one day there.

Willow: I wish I could get a passing grade for once. Then people would stop calling me "Half-a-Witch Willow."

[She kicks her spilled abomination, which groans.]

Luz: Hey, wait. I know how we can both get what we want. [picks up abomination goo in both hands and splashes it on her hoodie] Make me your abomination. I'll get you a good grade, and you can get me into magic school. It's fiendishly clever.

Willow: What?

Luz: I saw that girl's thing. It's just chunks of stuff that talks weird. I'm chunks of stuff, and I talk weird!

Willow: That's true. [giggles] Okay. It's a deal. Luz.

[They shake hands.]

Luz: This is a great plan.

[They try to pull their hands apart, but the abomination goo on Luz's leaves them stuck together.]

Willow: Oops. Abomination goo.

[Luz uses her foot to free them, but the force sends her splashing in the goo on the ground.]

Luz: Great plan.

[Willow perks up. Cut to the exterior of a school.]

Willow: Welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics. Remember to stay hidden, okay?

[Luz, of inside Willow's abomination pot, squeals and giggles. Cut to the interior of Hexside. Willow stops at a locker, tickling it to make it open its mouth and give her her books. A shorter witch reading a magazine bumps into her.]

Willow: Hmm?

Gus: Willow, you would not believe humans.

Willow: Humans? Psh. I haven't seen any. What?

Gus: [showing her the magazine] Did you know that humans nail barbed wire to their kids' teeth? But why? Maybe to make them magnetic.

Luz: Actually, it's for storing treats.

[Gus looks confused.]

Willow: Okay, Augustus. I'm gonna tell you something. But you have to be cool.

Gus: I can be spool. [stammers] I mean, cool.

Willow: Okay. Abomination, rise.

Luz: [stands out of the pot] Ta-da! I'm an abomination.

Willow: Luz, that's not how abominations act.

Gus: [drops his magazine] No. No, it, [plays with his ears while staring at Luz's] it couldn't be.

Willow: He's the president of the Human Appreciation Society. Most witches wouldn't be able to recognize a human right away. But Augustus is an expert.

Gus: Where are your gills?

Luz: I knew an Augustus back in the human world. We called him Gus.

Gus: Gus? Nickname? Human nickname? Gus? Call me it. Wow. Gus. This is the best day of my life.

[A bell screams.]

Gus: I've gotta get to spelling class. [grabs his magazine and a wand before running off] See you guys at lunch!

Willow: [waves at Gus] All right. Into the darkness you go.

Luz: [hisses as she sinks down]

[Cut to the outside of the Owl House, where King is giving the baby trash slug a dog treat.]

King: Aw. Who's a good Prince, Jr.? Who's a good guy?

Eda: [in a lounge chair drinking out of a coffee mug] Hey, Mr. Wiggles. You're not gonna teach it anything doing that.

King: It's called positive reinforcement, Eda. And it works wonders.

[Prince Jr. eats the treat King was dangling in front of it and doubles in size.]

King: Ha ha! See? Now watch this. Prince, Jr.! Attack Eda! Knock over her drink! Mess up her hair!

Eda: [deadpan] Oh, no. Please stop.

King: Well, I haven't seen your student in forever. For all we know, she's not even loyal to you anymore.

Eda: Ha-ha-ha, you wish. But yeah. Where is she?

[Cut to Abomination 101.]

Male student: Hope I pass.

Female student: I'm confident about this.

[Female student with ram horns stands at the front of the room with an abomination with eight feet sticking out of it in various places.]

Abomination Teacher: Hmm. Too many toenails in unexpected places. Fail. Pathetic!

[The abomination and the student deflate. She wheels her abomination off the platform at the front of the room.]

Abomination Teacher: The biggest abominations are all of you! If the next abomination is a failure, everyone gets extra homework for a month!

[all grumbling]

Male student: Extra homework? Not again!

Abomination Teacher: [clears throat] And the next one to come up is...

Amity: Excuse me, sir, but I am ready to present my abomination. Rise!

[It rises from the pot, groaning, and poses.]

Abomination Teacher: [chuckles] I've always saved the best for last, Amity. You'll have to wait your turn. How about... Willow.

Male student: Not Half-a-Witch.

Female student: Great. Homework for a month.

Luz: [peeks out of the pot] Don't listen to them, Willow. We can do this.

[Willow gives her a small smile and nods. She wheels her pot to the front of the room and sets it down nervously.]

Willow: Uh... Abomination, rise.

Luz: [punches the lid off and jumps out] Ta-da!

[all gasp]

Willow: Abomination, bow.

Luz: [grunts] Blah!

Abomination Teacher: Very impressive. But does it speak?

Luz: Uh, I may be your abomination, but you're my a-mom-ination.

Students: Aw!

Abomination Teacher: [laughs] "A-mom-ination!" Splendid wordplay. A plus!

[students cheer]

[The bell screams, coughs. Students leave the room.]

Abomination Teacher: Wonderful work today, Willow. Looks like we have a new top student.

[Amity, who was leaving the room, gasps and drops her books as she stops. The Abomination Teacher takes her top student badge.]

Amity: [growls and reaches for her badge] But...

[The Abomination Teacher pins the badge to Willow's cowl.]

Willow: Uh-- Thank you, sir.

[He nods and his abomination carries him away. Willow turns to leave, but Amity is standing in front of her.]

Amity: Hey.

Willow: [gasps]

Amity: Last time I saw you, your abomination was mush. What did you do?

Willow: I, uh, took your pep talk to heart, Amity.

Amity: I bet you did. I've got my eyes on you, Half-a-Witch. That badge is mine. [She walks backwards, not breaking eye contact with Willow even as she bumps into another student.]

Student: Hey!

Willow: [after Amity rounds a corner] Uh-oh. I think Amity is onto us.

[Cut to the front door of the Owl House, which is slammed open by Eda.]

Hooty: OW!

Eda: Have you seen Luz?

Hooty: I heard her tiny mouse feet walking close by. Or that might've been some mice. Anyway, someone started moving in that direction. [slightly gesturing with his head] Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo.

Eda: Are you trying to point, or--?

Hooty: Look at the weather vane!

[She does.]

Eda: But the only thing that way is the... [gasps] No. [runs off] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[She reaches Hexside and looks into various windows. The first is a kindergarten classroom.]

Teacher #1: Okay, everyone. Recite your runes.

Kids: Krom, Zix, Elgrim, Zenomide--

Eda: No. Blind obedience.

[The next classroom has several older students writing at desks while a snake-like teacher speaks.]

Teacher #2: Heximal system time! Let's get memorizin'!

Eda: No! Pointless busywork!

[Luz, still covered in abomination goo, is in the last classroom, writing along with the rest of the class.]

Eda: No! Why! School!

[Cut to the cafeteria, where Luz, back in the pot, is sitting at the end of a table with Willow and Gus.]

Gus: Hey. Do humans eat PB&J's?

Luz: Oh my gosh I haven't eaten real food in so long please give me some.

[Gus breaks the PB&J in half and gives Luz one. She takes the whole thing in her mouth and sinks back into the pot.]

Willow: I don't know, Gus. [grumbles] If Amity saw that...

Amity: [jumps onto the table] I saw that! Abominations don't eat! I know you're in there! You can't hide from me. What are you? Who are you? I want answers! [grabs Luz by her shirtfront and shakes her violently]

Abomination Teacher: Amity Blight.

Amity: [stops shaking Luz] Huh?

Abomination Teacher: I suspected a twinge of jealousy, but this, this is just sad.

Amity: But I-- No! Look at it.

Luz: [groans as her head falls back]

Abomination Teacher: Report to Principal Bump's office.

Amity: But--

Abomination Teacher: Now!

[Amity drops Luz and runs off. As the Abomination Teacher leaves, Luz pops back out, sharing a concerned look with Willow.]

[Cut to the outside of the Owl House, where King is tossing handfuls of dog treats to Prince Jr.]

King: Roll over! Yes! Heel!

[Prince Jr. did neither command, focused only on the treats. He now towers over King.]

King: Yes, yes!

[Prince Jr. roars. Eda returns.]

King: So, did you find your runaway student? By your expression, I can tell Luz has gone and found herself someplace else to learn. Which means I have won!

[Prince Jr. roars as he catches more treats.]

Eda: Yes, great, you won.

[King throws a handful of treats to the side. Prince Jr. chases them.]

Eda: You have a giant soldier thing and I have nothing. Congrats!

King: Oh, Eda. Don't say that. At least you have this! [He pulls out a shame cone and cackles.]

Eda: Ugh. [snatches it up and stalks off]

King: [laughing as Eda enters the shack attached to the Owl House] I am so funny! Ah, well, Prince, Jr. training complete. Go forth! Make the world tremble at your feet-- or worm stubs.

[Prince Jr. doesn't move.]

King: Go forth?

[He still doesn't move.]

King: Oh. [chuckles] Right.

[He picks up the dog treat box and shakes it, but it's empty. Prince Jr. moves closer, growling.]

King: Ah!

[Cut to a classroom, where Luz is standing out of the pot.]

Luz: Whoo! I'm a sweaty little abomination. But now we don't have to worry about Amity. High five!

[Willow and Gus stare at her hand, then share a confused look. Gus shrugs.]

Luz: [demonstrating] Slap my hand. It's a human thing.

[Gus hesitantly gives her a high five. Then he does it several more times with growing confidence.]

Gus: Oh. Oh, my. Oh, man, what a rush!

[The classroom door opens, revealing Amity. She smirks and steps aside, allowing Principal Bump to enter the room.]

Principal Bump: Good afternoon, students.

Willow: Principal Bump.

[Luz drops, pretending to be an abomination. Principal Bump steps closer to her. Willow and Gus back off as he kneels down, turning her head.]

Principal Bump: Hmm. Abomination, rise.

[She does, looking nervous.]

Principal Bump: Abomination, lie.

Luz: Uh, viral fame is a worthy pursuit. Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance. Chemtrails are real--

Principal Bump: Oh, no, abomination. How strange for it to get the command wrong. I mean lie down. [points to a desk]

Luz: [whimpers as she goes to lie down on it]

Principal Bump: So very lifelike. [approaches the table with Willow] When Miss Blight told me about your abomination, I had to come by, see what she's made of.

Willow: Oh, I have her list of ingredients right here.

Principal Bump: No. We were hoping... [pulls a dagger out of his sleeve] for a closer look. Willow, I'll allow you the first cut.

[Willow takes the offered dagger and smiles at him nervously. She steps closer to Luz.]

Willow: [quietly] Uh, you can't just cut open a human, can you?

Luz: [shakes her head]

Principal Bump: Willow, go ahead and make the first incision.

Gus: Wait, Principal Bump! Uh, high five!

[Gus knocks over three abomination pots. The goo spills together, and the formed abominations stand.]

Gus: Run!

[Willow and Luz run.]

Amity: They're getting away!

Principal Bump: No, the intruder won't get far.

[He approaches a wall and traces a large spell circle, then slams the wall in the center of it. Red light forms patterns on the walls and floor, spreading from the spell circle. Cut to Willow and Luz running through the halls, both panting as they stop at a corner.]

Luz: This is all my fault, Willow. I just wanted to see what a real magic school was like.

Willow: Well, how do you like it?

Luz: It's lovely, actually.

[Both giggle.]

Willow: Okay, we should get out of here before--

[The red light patterns converge on the walls. When they reach a doorway, a red shield blocks it off. Several more doorways are blocked off, the patterns taking over the school.]

Willow: ...Bump seals us in.

[Cut to the inside of the Owl House's shack, where Eda is sulking in the shame hat. She looks up at King's voice.]

King: Help me, help me, help me!

[He runs in and slams the door, then dives into Eda's arms, whimpering. The door shudders under Prince Jr.'s attacks.]

Eda: [smirking] Trouble with your student?

King: Yes, yes!

[Banging on the door continues.]

Eda: Are you sure you need my help? Maybe he only wants more of your brilliant lessons.

[The door shatters as Prince Jr. bursts through and roars. He grabs King by the tail and drags him out of Eda's arms.]

King: [squeals] Please help me! You can call me Mr. Wiggles!

[Eda stands, removing the shame hat and grabbing her staff. She smacks Prince Jr. in the face with the butt of her staff, making it release King. Prince Jr. retreats as King clings to Eda's leg.]

King: [whimpers]

Eda: Okay, Mr. Wiggles. Here's what we're gonna do.

[Cut to Hexside. Willow and Luz reach the central atrium, but doorways are still being sealed off. Shadows fall over them. They turn and gasp. Bump is there, directing abominations toward them. They run a bit and hide behind a pillar.]

Willow: Oh, this is awful. [sinks to the ground] I don't know what to do. Amity's right. I'm just Half-a-Witch Willow.

Luz: You're Full-Witch Willow. And you're great. And someone once told me great witches are resourceful. [pulls out the contents of her pockets.]

Willow: That's it! [takes the slime ball]

Luz: You mean that greasy slime ball?

Willow: Luz, it's a seed! Thank goodness you had it on you.

Luz: Yeah. Thank goodness someone told me to hold on to it.

Willow: [puts the seed in her lap and traces a spell circle over it] Please grow!

[Thorny vines grow from the seed, reaching to the ceiling. They stab through abominations and eventually target Principal Bump, sending him to the ceiling and pinning him there.]

Principal Bump: [gasps]

[Vines now cover the entire atrium, curled around pillars and reaching from the bottom most floor to the absolute ceiling. Pink petals fall from above, and several of the vines have flowers on them.]

Principal Bump: Remarkable.

[The lights sealing off the hallways fades.]

Luz: There's the exit!

[Willow puts the seed on the floor and follows Luz to the exit.]

Amity: [blocking the way] Not so fast!

[both gasp]

Amity: I'm not letting you get away so easily. I want my badge! Abominations, seize!

[An abomination comes from behind them. Luz punches it through the chest, then takes Willow's wrist and runs. Amity reforms the abomination and sends it after them again. Luz and Willow now seem to have a clear path to freedom, but another abomination forms in front of them.]

Willow: [screams]

Luz: Whoa!

[The abomination staggers forward. Willow traces out a large spell circle, causing vines to trap the abomination.]

Willow: Get outta here!

Luz: No! I'm not leaving you.

Willow: I may get detention, but you'll get dissected.

[The abominations from before melt through the vines, reforming and staggering toward the girls]

Willow: So go!

[She waves a hand, summoning two vines to carry Luz over the abomination and out the door. The door slams after the vines retreat.]

Luz: Willow! [sighs] I can't save you right now. But I know someone who can! [runs off]

[Cut to Eda fighting Prince Jr. It spits lava at her, which she easily dodges. She smacks it in the face with her staff, twice. It backs her toward the front door. Meanwhile, King is pushing a barrel on the roof.]

Eda: Pour the salt, now!

King: Baby boy!

[Prince Jr. looks up at King, whimpering. Then it roars.]

King: I have no son. Eat salt!

[He shoves the entire barrel full of salt into Prince Jr.'s mouth. It shivers and makes noises of protest, before shrinking back to its original size. It whimpers as it runs off.]

King: [dances] Yes, I did it! I'm amazing! Ahh!

[Eda catches him.]

King: [chuckles] You helped too. You are a good teacher.

Eda: I wish Luz thought that too.

Luz: [running toward them] Eda!

Eda: Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is this? [Luz hugs her and King] Ugh! I never understand when you do this.

Luz: Your lesson worked! Keeping junk in my pocket saved my life! [gasps] But wait. My new friends. They're in danger.

Willow: Luz!

[Willow and Gus hug Luz, who happily returns it.]

Eda: Seriously, what is that?

Willow: You won't believe it, Luz. Everything is perfect now!

Luz: It's true. I don't believe it.

Willow: Principal Bump was so impressed by my plant work he's switching me to the plant magic track! Look!

[She backs away and snaps her fingers. With a glow of green magic and a twirl, her sleeves and leggings go from magenta to green.]

Luz: [hugs Willow again] Yes!

Willow: [giggles]

Luz: Whoo! Oh. What about Amity?

Gus: Last we saw, she was asking Bump if today could count as extra credit.

Luz: Well, I can't wait to see you in action next time I sneak in. [Behind her, Willow winces.]

Gus: Uh, about that. You're kinda, sorta... banned.

[He pulls out and unfurls a poster reading "BANNED" with a picture of Luz covered in abomination goo under it.]

Eda: That's my girl!

Willow: But we could come here and teach you what we learned.

Luz: Aw. That would be nice. But... I have a pretty great teacher already.

Eda: Yeah, that's right. Luz is my student. [steals the poster] Back off, academy twerps.

[all laughing]

Eda: Ah, baby's first wanted poster. Good job, kid. [pats the top of Luz's head] Looks like I taught you something after all.

Gus: Uh, you high five with your hands, not your head.


Luz: " 'Azura,' Hecate began. 'Our paths have crossed only in battle. But today I stand before you seeking an ally.' " [sighs]

King: Luz, you're getting all swoony again.

Luz: I can't help it. Azura is able to befriend everyone. Even her biggest rival. I wish I had that kind of power.

King: Rivals are meant to be annihilated not befriended. Now keep reading. I've been sucked into your awful fandom.

Luz: Okay. "Suddenly the door swung open."

Hooty: [swings the door open] Ding-dong. Ding. Hoot! Hoot!

King: The book has come to life! Burn it!

[Luz goes to the door and finds a basket.]

Luz: Hmm?

[Cut to the kitchen.]

Luz: Eda, you got a package. It looks like a gift basket.

Eda: Probably an offering. Ah! Being the most powerful witch in the Boiling Isles has its perks.

[King, a bib now tied on, grunts as he pulls a blanket off the top of the basket, revealing a snoring baby bat.]

King: [rubbing his paws together] Mm. Fresh meat.

Luz: No, not eating that.

Eda: Witches eating babies is so 1693. What is this?

King: There's a note. [grabs it] "Take care of my child till morning. Yi Yi."

Eda: Nope. Babies are awful. Not happening.

King: "You will be handsomely rewarded. X-O-X-O-X-O-X. Bat Queen."

Eda: Bat Queen?

[King pulls a few snails out of the basket. Eda's eyes widen.]

Eda: Reward?

Luz: Who's the Bat Queen?

[King sniffs the snails.]

Eda: She's the wealthiest demon on the Boiling Isles. Get in with her and you're set for life. [takes one of the snails] So, we keep this thing alive for a few hours and we get paid. Pfft. Easy.

Luz: Our greatest adventure yet! Learning about love and life through a child's eyes.

Eda: Not you. You have to return the books I checked out from the library.

[Eda summons a pile of books, which Luz catches.]

Eda: [to King] I don't want her getting a cut of the loot.

King: Good thinking.

Eda: Now, let's take a look at this little darling. [fully takes the blanket off.]

Baby bat: [screeching]

Eda: Argh!

King: Oh, boy.

Eda: On second thought maybe we could use your help!

Luz: [halfway out the door] Well, I better get to the library! Got to go! Bye!

Baby bat: [screeching continues]

Eda: We got this, right?

[The baby bat flies out of the basket and into Eda's face.]

Eda: Whoa! [audibly falls]

[THEME]

[Cut to the streets of Bonesborough, where Luz is struggling to walk with her load. She passes Tiny Nose, carrying a book as big as Luz.

Luz: Huh? Whoa.

[Watches Tiny Nose pass, nearly drops her books. She catches them and continues on for a few steps until she sees the library across the street.]

Luz: Whoa!

[Cut to the inside of the library as she enters. The book pile glows green and begins floating forward.]

Luz: Huh?

[Each book flies through a red spell circle.]

Librarian #1: Late.

[beeps]

Librarian #1: Late.

[beeps]

Librarian #1: [grabs the last book] Coffee, grass and bloodstains? These are Eda's, aren't they?

Luz: Huh. That was a crazy night.

Librarian #1: [sighs] I'll put them on her tab. [summons a scroll and writes on it] By the way, we're closing early for the Wailing Star meteor shower. [Gestures to a framed picture of the Wailing Star.]

Luz: Ooh. What's that?

Librarian #1: You're in a library. Read a book.

[His scroll rolls up and disappears.]

Luz: I am in a library. I will read a book. [runs off]

Librarian #1: Shh!

[Cut to a banner reading "Demon Decimal System DO NOT FEED." Luz rounds the corner and walks up to the growling card catalogues, feeding one a gumball.]

Luz: Bloop.

[It gladly chews it for a few seconds before barfing up notecards. Cut to a study area, where several Hexisde students are reading. Luz, standing on the balcony above them, grabs onto one of the dozens of books flying around.]

Luz: Wow! [screaming]

People: Shh!

Luz: [screams] Sorry!

[Cut to the reference section, where witches are watching things on crystal balls. One is watching a "HOW TO FLY" video, another is watching a piano cat parody, and a third is stuck on a loading screen, dial-up internet noises emitting from it. The last witch slaps the crystal ball a few times. Luz is watching them from around a bookshelf.]

Luz: This place is amazing.

Amity: [offscreen] " 'What do you think you're doing?' "

Luz: [gasps] I've been caught. Pretend to be a book. [poses]

[kids giggling]

Luz: Wait. [walks forward]

[Amity is reading to a group of baby-class students.]

Amity: " 'We're your friends and we wanna help,' said the Tin Boy with a yelp. Otabin smiled and paced the floor. 'I've never had real friends before.' "

Luz: Amity reading to kids?

[Luz sneaks into the kid's corner as Amity reads.]

Amity: " 'Then we'll be your first,' the Chicken Witch clucked. Otabin couldn't believe his luck. So, Bookmaker Otabin surrounded by friends, bound a book of friendship and that's the end."

[She closes the book to applause from the kids.]

Luz: Amity seems so... nice and smiley. [gasps] Maybe I can befriend her like Azura befriended her rival. [grunts and ducks down as the kids leave]

Kid #1: Thank you so much.

[laughing]

Kid #2: Good-bye.

Braxas: [hugging Amity's leg] Good-bye, Miss Amity. Thank you.

Amity: [pats his head] Thank you, Braxas. See you next time.

Braxas: [runs off] Yay!

[Amity watches him go. She quickly looks to the side, then does a double take at Luz hiding under a book. Amity's normal attitude returns.]

Amity: Ugh! You.

Luz: Amity... [stands and leans on a book, making it fall] Whoop. Reading to kids. Wow. Looks like this sour lemon drop has a hidden sweet center.

Amity: It's for extra credit. [picks up the book Luz dropped] Don't get your leggings in a bunch. [walks to the back of the room]

Luz: [follows her] Hey, I could help with the kids. We could take turns reading. And do voices. I do the best [robotic tone] monster voice.

Amity: [slams her pile of books on a table] Human! [faces Luz] Do you see me going to the Owl Shack and bugging you while you... fry up owls? [scoffs] Okay, I don't really know what you do there, but every time you come near me, I get in trouble. Just leave me alone.

Luz: [backs up] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[Luz walks away. Amity starts to raise her hand to stop her, but doesn't. ]

Luz: [groans and bumps her fist against her forehead] So much for befriending rivals.

Edric: You gonna let her get to you like that?

[Luz looks over and sees Edric and Emira. They walk up to her, Edric holding a rabbit lunch bag.]

Luz: Who are you?

Edric: Well-wishers on a mission.

Emira: A noble quest.

Edric: Watch this. Hey, Mittens.

Amity: [grunts as her face turns bright red]

Edric: [holds up the lunch bag] Mom says stop forgetting your lunch. And stop being a jerk to your friend.

Amity: [stalks over and grabs the bag] She is not my friend.

[Luz looks down at the floor, but looks back up when Emira puts an arm around her.]

Emira: Yeah, makes sense. She seems too cool for you.

Luz: I am?

Amity: You can leave now. All of you. [walks back into the kid's corner]

Emira: [chuckles]

[Edric winks at Luz]

Luz: [chuckles and blushes]

[Cut to the three of them walking around.]

Edric: So, you're the human we've heard so much about.

Emira: I'm Emira. And this is Edric. We're Amity's older siblings. We heard how you embarrassed her at the school and at the witch covention last week. No wonder she hates you.

Luz: I know. But I didn't mean any of it. I thought we were as cool as cucumbers. But we're as sour as pickles.

Emira: Don't waste your time with Mittens. Me and Ed, we're way more fun. Follow us.

[The three of them walk off, Luz looking down at where Emira is holding her wrist. Cut to a sign reading "<- FICTION NON-FICTION->". Edric wipes away the "NON" and hides as a second librarian walks up, leading patrons.]

Librarian #2: And here we go towards our nonfiction section. [gasps when he sees the sign] Fiction. Fiction. Is our world but fiction? Then what in my life is real anymore? [sobbing]

[Cut to where Librarian #1 is reading while shelving books. As he puts one on the shelf, it glows blue and flies back onto the reshelving cart. This happens several times before Emira is revealed to be doing it, her, Edric, and Luz all laughing. Edric switches the places of the two librarians.]

Librarian #2: Huh? No! Not again! [sobbing]

[The first librarian falls off a ladder. Cut to Edric holding up a dusty book. He blows the dust at the demon decimal system, which all sneeze, showering the area with notecards.]

Luz: Whoo!

[They all laugh as Luz dances and the twins high five.]

Amity: Hey!

[Amity is standing next to the first librarian, both of them with their arms crossed. He looks around.]

Librarian #1: [growls] Wait. Where's Gary?

Librarian #2: [runs in] Coming. Nooo! [sobbing]

[Cut to the front entrance, where Luz and the twins are shoved out.]

All: Whoa!

Librarian #1: You've made reading far too fun. Now, stay out.

[The door slams shut. The three of them look at it for a second before laughing. Emira punches Luz's shoulder.]

Luz: Amity's even madder at me now. I didn't think that was possible.

Edric: No, when Mittens gets mad, she looks like this. [inhales sharply, grunting as his face turns red; exhales] Whoa, I almost passed out.

Emira: You're pretty fun, human.

[She and Edric nod at each other.]

Emira: So, hey, we're coming back tonight. There's a certain book we forgot to... check out.

Edric: And bonus, rumor has it the Wailing Star's supposed to unlock some rare magical event. You in, friend?

Luz: Sure.

Edric: Great. Meet back here at midnight. See you, Luz.

[The twins leave. Luz waves at them.]

Luz: Bye. This is great. First I befriend the siblings then I befriend the Amity. [squeals and runs off]

[Amity is standing around the corner, likely having seen the whole thing. She holds her breath until her face turns red.]

Amity: [grunts] Phew! Almost passed out.

[Cut to the Owl House living room, where the baby bat is crying. King has pillows tied to his head and Eda has both her hands detached and plugging her ears while her arms are crossed.]

King: It's been hours. How can it keep screaming?

Eda: Ugh. I hate it too, pip-squeak. [reattaches her hands] But think about the money.

[The crying continues. Three glass bottles shatter. The glass covering Eda's wanted poster cracks.]

King: No amount of snails is worth this torture. [falls to the floor] Make it stop.

Eda: [sighs] I can't believe I'm about to do this.

[She picks the bat up. It immediately stops crying. King and Eda both look at it in disbelief.]

Eda: Rock, rock. Maternal gesture.

[Luz enters the house.]

Luz: I just had the best day. Cool teens like me. Call me a library book 'cause they were checking me out.

[She looks over at the couch.]

Luz: Aw, Eda, you look so motherly.

Eda: Say that again and I steal your tongue.

Luz: [walks over] Aw. How can you say that around this cute little baby?

[Luz repeatedly pokes the baby bat. It wakes up and barfs out a smaller version of itself, as does that version. They all chirp and flap their wings.]

Luz: [recoils] Whoa!

[The bats fly upwards, still chirping. One of them breathes fire. Eda, King, and Luz all scream and run away from the couch, which is the unfortunate target. Luz runs for the door.]

Luz: [putting her messenger bag on] Parenting sure looks rewarding. E-Enjoy your life lessons. Bye.

[She closes the door as she leaves. The bats fly around, knocking things off shelves and causing mayhem. Eda is holding King.]

King: Uh, for, for the money?

Eda: For the money. [yelps]

[She ducks out of the way of a green liquid that splashes the wall. Cut to the library that night, crickets chirping. Luz is pacing next to a pillar.]

Luz: Gotta be cool. [rests her arm on the pillar] Cool? [shakes her head and facepalms] No. [leans against the pillar] Cool. [grunts as she kneels down while throwing a peace sign; groans and drops her head]

Emira: Keep going.

Luz: Huh? [falls]

Emira: [leaning against the opposite pillar] This is fun to watch.

Edric: You ready to bring this whole, uh, whatever you're doing, inside?

Luz: [nods] Mm-hmm-mm-hmm.

[They all approach the door.]

Edric: It says no trespassing but I'm allergic to the rules. [pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Emira]

Emira: And dairy.

Edric: Wow, okay. Just expose me.

[The paper glows. Emira puts it against the lock on the door. The paper crumbles.]

Luz: Wow!

[The lock grows until it's large enough for them to walk through.]

Edric: Come on.

[The lock shrinks back down once they all enter. Cut to inside.]

Luz: Standing in a dimly lit lobby. You guys know how to party.

Edric: There. The Wailing Star!

[The Wailing Star sobs as it passes the stained glass window.]

Luz: Whoa.

[The three of them look around for several seconds as the books slowly begin glowing green.]

Edric: Hmm. Nothing happened.

Luz: Wait. [grabs a book titled "Extinct Birds of the Boiling Isles"] The books are all glowy.

[She opens the book. Almost immediately, something screeches as the birds in the book come to life. They fly around the lobby.]

Emira: Wow!

Edric: Wow. The Wailing Star magicked the books to life.

[Luz, still watching the birds, closes the book. The birds disappear. The three of them share a look, and then grins.]

[Cut to a magazine stand. Edric opens "Regal Couture," which dresses him and Emira in fancy clothing. A peacock flies out of it. Luz grabs "Witch Wares Weekly" and gets a giant sword, among other things. Luz yelps as she falls over.]

[Cut to the three of them standing next to the graphic novel section. Luz opens one.]

Luz: Nothing happened.

[Her words appear in a dialogue bubble. They all gasp when it appears, the twins taking steps back.]

Edric & Emira: Wow!

[That too comes out in a word bubble. Both pop when Luz closes the book, a "THUMP" sound bubble appearing as she does.]

[Cut to Luz holding "Snowballs, a History." She looks around a corner and sees Edric, holding the same book.]

Luz: Ha!

[She opens the book, pelting Edric with snowballs.]

Edric: [grunts, falls; opens book and returns fire] Ah!

Luz: Ah! [runs]

[She's safe for a second before Emira appears, opening yet another copy of "Snowballs, a History" directly in Luz's face.]

Luz: [yelps]

Emira: [giggles]

[Edric and Emira laugh as they run past the kid's corner. Luz stands from where she was hiding behind a shelf and notices "Otabin the Bookmaker," the book Amity had read to the kids, glowing on the table. She picks it up and opens it, and Otabin rises out of the pages. She smiles at him.]

[Cut to the Owl House, where a baby bat is holding a mace in its claws as it flies. Another pours a green potion out on the floor. A third is jumping on the turned-over couch, under which Eda and King are hiding. The first bat is now wearing another pair of Eda's shoes.]

King: What silences children? What if we invent a TV network for ages six to 11--

Eda: That's insane. Aah, there's only one way out of this. [reaches into her hair and pulls out a knife.]

King: [gasps]

Eda: [cuts an apple] Apple slices and story time. [pulls out a copy of "Otabin"; sits on the couch] All right, brats. Let's do this. Ugh. Being parental is making me sick.

[The baby bats all sit on the floor. King joins them, holding the plate of apple slices. His pupils dilate as Eda opens the book and begins reading.]

Eda: "Otabin spend his days alone amongst the many books he'd sewn. With needle and thread..."

[Fade to Luz reading in the library.]

Luz: "...the pages he mend. But all the while he longed for a friend."

Otabin: [threading a needle] Friend?

Edric: Luz, check this out.

Emira: Look what we discovered.

[Emira opens a book called "Quacks Eats Snacks." A duck swims out of the pages and around the floor, quacking happily.]

Luz: Aw. Cute little quackster.

[Emira holds the book out to Edric, who has a pencil. He draws legs on the duck in the book. In the real world, the duck now has matching giant human legs. It quacks hysterically.]

Emira: Now he's extra cute. [closes the book]

Edric & Emira: [laughing]

Emira: Your turn, Luz.

Luz: [backing away from them] I don't know.

Edric: [offering his pencil] Come on. Don't stop the fun.

[Luz takes the pencil hesitantly and opens "Otabin." She looks at the drawing of him on the page.]

Luz: [sighs] I can't do it.

Edric: Let me help.

Luz: [grunts]

[Edric grabs Luz's hand and draws angry eyebrows and claws on Otabin. Something starts to rise out of the pages, but Luz slams it closed.]

Luz: [grunts] I don't wanna see it.

Emira: Whatever. We didn't come here just to doodle. Come on.

[Emira takes Luz's hand and leads the way. Luz drops the book face down. A clawed hand grows out of the book, and whatever it is growls.]

[Cut to the romance section.]

Luz: Oh, wow. Boiling Isles romance. That's totally lame. I mean, unless you guys are into it?

Edric: I think I'm into this one.

[Pulls a book titled "The Lone Witch & Secret Room." Something clicks. The bookshelf sinks back and slides away, revealing a secret room.]

Luz: Wow! That's a good book.

[Luz enters the room as the twins lean against the entrance.]

Luz: Your clubhouse is like my ultimate secret hideaway.

Edric: We don't hang out in a library. "Uh, teacher, I'm in love with a dictionary."

Emira: "I'm studying the dork arts." This is Amity's secret hideaway.

[Luz looks worried.]

Edric: Mittens has gotten too... full of herself. She keeps tattling on us when we cut class.

Emira: She needs to learn not to mess with people like that. So, we're going to find her diary.

Edric: And then post the pages all around school for everyone to see.

Edric & Emira: [laugh]

Luz: What? Isn't that taking it a bit too far?

Emira: No. See, we're her family. It's tough love. She needs to learn to lighten up.

[The twins start to look around.]

Luz: Hmm. Well, I-- I don't see any diaries in here. [half-heartedly looks around] Nope, nothin'. Let's just leave. Wait, are those... [squeals] Good Witch Azura books one through four! You get these on the Boiling Isles? So majestic. [grabs a book] Is this cover hand-drawn?

[The cover is of Amity dressed as Azura. Luz opens it, and a small version of Amity rises from the pages.]

Amity's Diary: I saw that... human girl again.

Luz: The diary.

Amity's Diary: I may have overreacted. I don't wanna come off as cruel. I just can't show weakness.

Luz: No. [closes it]

Edric: What've you got there, Luz?

Luz: [hides the diary behind her back] Oh. N-Nothing. Just a Good Witch Azura 5 where she goes through her Goth phase.

[The diary glows blue and flies out of her hands.]

Luz: Huh? No, wait.

[Emira catches the diary and hands it to Edric, who opens it.]

Amity's Diary: It's not fair. I'm the only one who knows Ed and Em aren't perfect. Why do they keep getting away with things?

Edric: This is it.

Emira: Luz, were you hiding this from us?

Edric: You see how she treats people. How she treats you.

Luz: I know Amity can be kind of cold but no one deserves this. These are private thoughts. Let's put it back.

[Luz grabs the diary and pulls, but Edric doesn't let go. They both pull at it, Emira tugging Edric's waist.]

Edric: She needs this.

Luz: [grunts]

Emira: It's for her own good.

Luz: [grunts]

[Pages spill onto the floor, and Luz looks at them in concern.]

Amity's Diary: "I wish I had somewhere to go." "Why won't the human leave me alone?" "Called my teacher mom again." "Sorry I haven't written for a while. Wait, why am I apologizing?"

[The pages repeat themselves as Luz hurries to pick them all back up. Amity approaches the doorway as she is collecting them.]

Amity: Really?

Luz: Argh. It's not what it looks like.

Edric & Emira: [both giggling]

Amity: [mad] You two are the worst. [takes her diary from Luz, sounding hurt] But you... I've been trying to figure out what your deal is. Are, are you a poser? A nerd? I know. You're a bully, Luz. [runs off]

Luz: Amity! [starts going after her but stops]

Edric & Emira: [both laughing]

Emira: Mittens killed the fun.

Edric: Again. Oh, well. We're headed out to go goblin-tipping. Wanna come?

Luz: You're just gonna leave?

Emira: Yeah, with you.

[Emira grabs Luz's wrist again. This time, she tugs her hand back.]

Luz Look, you guys are cool.

Edric & Emira: [nod] Mm-hmm.

Luz: But I need to go talk to Mittens. I mean, Amity.

Emira: All right. [winks] See you around, cutie.

[Her and Edric leave. Luz blushes, then runs off after Amity. Cut to a random aisle of books, where Amity is walking.]

Luz: [rounding the corner] Amity, wait.

Amity: First you embarrass me. Then you wanna be my friend? I don't get you. Pick a side.

Luz: Please, just listen to me.

Amity: Just go away before things somehow get worse.

[loud footsteps]

Luz: Huh?

[The monstrous form of Otabin created by Edric's drawing snarls as it steps into the aisle. His heart beats loudly, his book pulsing with it.]

Amity: Otabin?

Otabin: With claws and fangs and breaking bones, I found a friend to make my own. [grabs Amity]

Amity: [grunts] Luz! [screams]

Luz: Amity!

Amity: Luz!

Luz: Amity. Huh?

[Looks down at Amity's diary. Cut to Amity getting slammed against a giant book.]

Amity: [grunts, gasps]

[Otabin is holding a large needle, threaded with a giant ball of thread. He raises the needle and lowers it in Amity's direction.]

Amity: [yelps]

[He sews her arm into the book.]

Amity: Huh? [gasps] Why are you doing this? I've been reading you since I was a kid. I know you're not like this. Someone changed you.

Otabin: But friends are what I've always sought. And now a friend my claws have caught.

[A rumbling attracts both their attentions. A purple cloud rolls in, a figure in white robes and hat landing with it. The cloud blinds Otabin for a moment.]

Amity: [gasps] Azura?

Luz: [holding Amity's diary] Close. [pulls at the robes] Is a drawn okay? I kind of interpreted the descriptions.

Amity: Luz!

Luz: Ah, right. [writing in the diary] The good witch, Luzura, grabs her trusty staff. [a staff rises from the pages and she grabs it] All right, beloved work of children's fiction. Let go of her.

[She runs at Otabin, yelling and grunting while swinging the staff around theatrically. Otabin catches the staff before she even gets close enough to hit him and throws it behind him. He grabs the diary and gently closes it. Luz's Azura costume disappears.]

Luz: [chuckles nervously] Not an Azura fan, are you?

[Luz grunts as she's slammed into the page opposite of Amity's. Otabin sews one of her arms in.]

Otabin: Making friends, taking friends, never be without my friends.

Luz: You fiend. You can't rhyme friends with friends.

Amity: Great work, Luzura.

Luz: Hey! I was trying to save you.

Amity: Well, it doesn't matter. We're gonna be stuck together forever.

[Luz looks at her sewn in arm, numb. She moves it, the page going with it, and brightens back up.]

Luz: No, we aren't. Follow my lead. [slams her feet against the book] One.

Amity: What are you doing?

Luz: Two. Three.

[Amity and Luz both yell as the book goes down, hitting Otabin in the head. When he recovers, the book is gone.]

Otabin: [running after them] Come back!

[Cut to Luz and Amity running through the library, still sewn to the book. They duck behind a small shelf.]

Amity: [grunts] Now what?

Luz: I don't know. I didn't even think that would work. I was all like "roaaar."

Amity: [stares at her and chuckles]

[Luz grins. The moment is ruined when Otabin's needle pierces the page next to Luz's head and she yells.]

Otabin: Friends. [growls]

[He uses the needle and thread like a fishing line, pulling the book towards him. Amity and Luz both yell as the book is tugged over the shelf and onto the floor. Luz tries to tear at the string keeping her arm down. Amity grabs onto a ladder, then hooks her legs around it, pulling her arm free and launching her into a return cart.]

Amity: Luz!

Luz: Me!

[Otabin grabs the book and pulls it completely toward him. Luz tries to kick at his chest. Otabin grabs the needle and pulls it through.]

Otabin: You squirm and fight, and scream and shout. But friendship always will win out.

Luz: [whimpers as the rest of her limbs are tied down]

[The thread wraps around Luz's head. Otabin slowly pulls it tight, and Luz braces for it. Amity rides in on the book return cart.]

Otabin: [looking up] Huh?

Amity: [screams]

[Otabin is launched into a bookshelf, which falls on him. He struggles under it. Amity pulls the string keeping Luz down off the book.]

Luz: Oh. Third dimension how I've missed you.

Otabin: [shoves the bookshelf off of him] We must stay friends until the end. There is no tear I cannot mend.

Luz: Gulp.

[She yells as Otabin grabs her again. He wraps the thread around her.]

Amity: [gasps, pulls a pencil out of her pocket and writes in the giant book] "Luz has to right a wrong."

[A giant magic eraser rises out of the book. Amity catches it.]

Amity: Luz, quick. [tosses the eraser]

[Luz catches it and erases Edric's drawings on the page of the book. Otabin returns to normal, and everything falls to the floor. Luz catches Otabin and places him on his feet. Amity walks over and picks him up.]

Otabin: I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.

Amity: Hey, it's okay. We're still friends.

[Amity nods to Luz, who closes the book. Otabin disappears, making Amity look sad. Luz walks over to her and grins.]

[Cut to morning as Luz and Amity leave the library.]

Luz: What an adventure. Thanks for helping clean up.

Amity: This never happened.

Luz: Wait. It doesn't make up for reading your diary but would you wanna borrow this? [holds out Azura 5] I noticed you only had up to four.

Amity: [takes it] Thank you. [starts to walk away, stops; sighs and turns around] Maybe you aren't a bully. I haven't exactly been the friendliest witch either. I'll think on that. [walks away]

[Luz grabs onto her messenger bag strap as she watches Amity leave. Cut to Luz entering the Owl House.]

Luz: Hi, guys. I'm...

[Everyone is asleep, snoring, on the green couch, Eda holding the baby bats and King on her lap.]

Luz: home. [smiles at them]

[The door bangs open.]

Hooty: Ding dong!

Luz: Hooty.

[A giant woman's head with bat wings crawls into the living room.]

Luz: Whoa. You must be Mama.

Bat Queen: Yi Yi. Mama is I. And I is the Bat Queen. [whistles]

[The baby bats fly away from Eda, settling into Bat Queen's hair.]

Bat Queen: Aah! Snuggle dumplings.

[She throws up a treasure chest, which opens to show several hundred snails. Bat Queen spits an Aztec death whistle on top of the snails.]

Bat Queen: For troubles. Eda is owed one.

[She squeezes back out of the doorway and flies away. Luz closes the door.]

Eda: [sleeptalking] Ah. Sweet babies. [wakes up] Babies? Where are the babies?

[Luz mimes flying away.]

Eda: Oh. And I just taught Junior how to pick locks too.

Luz: Your night looks very successful. Look at all that money you made. And look at this cool whistle that scary woman gave you. [spit drops off the whistle] I'd wash it before you use it.

Eda: Yeah. We did it all for the money.

King: I miss my babies. [hugs Eda]

Luz: I actually got you something from the library.

[She hands Eda a book titled "Coping with Empty Nest Syndrome."]

Eda: [chuckles] Thanks, kid. So, how was your night?

Luz: Good. Then bad. Then maybe good?

[door squeaks]

Hooty: Hey, you wanna hear about my night?

Luz: Ugh. No!

Eda: No!

King: That's not a thing anyone ever wants.
King: Weh! [falls off the table] Stupid flag!

[Luz walks in carrying a ladder and a wooden sign.]

Luz: It's been a little slow around here, but I've got just the thing to attract customers.

[She puts the wooden sign on top of the "HUMAN COLLECTABLES" sign and taps it, activating the light glyphs carved into it.]

Luz: And who doesn't like their name in lights?

[Fully illuminated, a winking face of Eda appears.]

Luz: Is it too subtle?

Boscha: Does subtle mean ugly?

[Boscha, Skara, and an Oracle track student are standing at the stand.]

Luz: Hi, Boscha! Hexsidians! See anything you like?

Boscha: Ew! No. I'm just here to take an ironic Penstagram next to your weird flashing trash sign.

[She summons her scroll and takes several pictures.]

Luz: It's not funny, Boscha.

Boscha: What are you going to do? Spit your human venom on me?

King: You have venom? Quick, Luz, start melting faces!

Luz: [kneels down] Even if I could, it's not worth it. You wouldn't understand how to handle teens like her.

King: [grabs her hood] No, I'll show you what to do. [grunts, jumps onto the table] You will tremble before me!

[The three teens stare at him.]

Boscha: Oh, he's so cute!

[She hugs King and summons her scroll, taking a picture with a filter.]

King: Weh! [shoves her face]

Boscha: How much? I have to own him.

King: [frees himself] You couldn't afford me, sister!

All: Aw!

King: That's the incorrect reaction!

Eda: [sniffs] I smell an easy mark. [jumps out of the tent] Hey, kid! Can I offer you the latest fashions from... [magically dresses herself in horribly clashing clothes] the human realm?

Boscha: Yeah, no.

[Skara and the Oracle track student laugh as the three of them leave.]

Eda: Well, [returns to her normal outfit] I hate her.

Luz: Yeah, teens can be sour, but I'm a little sweetie. Look what I made you!

[She points to her sign.]

Eda: Luz! [takes the sign down]

Luz: Did I spell something wrong? Or did I spell something right?

Eda: Stop that. [wipes away the lights] You may be forgetting something, Luz. I'm kinda... [holds up her wanted poster] on the run! Remember? Every guard in town would be at my doorstep if I had my name in lights.

Luz: Well, I don't see anyone right now. Maybe you're just being paranoid. You're a powerful witch. Why hide when you can "poof" all your problems away with magic?

King: What does Luz know about problems anyway? All she has is dumb teen drama! She doesn't understand how hard some of us have it.

Eda: You're pampered all day like a dang baby. How hard is that life?

King: Well, I don't know if you realized, but I'm not a baby!

Luz: Then why are you screaming like one?

King: My life is a living nightmare!

Eda: Well, there's only one thing to do when friends can't see eye to eye.

Luz: Hug each other till we pass out? [hugs King]

King: Fight to the death!

Eda: Pfft, no. Body swap!

King: [to Luz] Are you sure you don't shoot venom?

[THEME]

Eda: I love a good body swap. It's like demonic possession with the ones you love.

Luz: We're doing that? That's possible? [grabs a VHS box] This is just like my favorite early 2000s movie! Freaky Fraturday. But maybe we should think about this for a second.

Eda: Body swap!

Luz: Ooh!

[Eda spins her staff above their heads, a curtain of yellow light and smoke falling over them.]

Luz: [in Eda's body] Did it work? I need a mirror. [runs into the mirror with a grunt, slides down] Found one. Oh, my gosh. It worked! I'm so old... [grabs her ears] and pointy!

[King in Luz's body walks up to the mirror.]

Luz: Hot dog! It's me!

King: [in Luz's body] Yeah, it is. I'm the human now. Bow before my massive, meaty hands!

Luz: Wait, so that means...

[Eda clears her throat. Luz and King look back at the table, where the last of the smoke dissipates.]

Eda: [in King's body] How do I look?

King: I've got some... very confusing emotions right now.

Eda: All right, here's the deal. Whoever can prove their new body has the easiest life gets out of house cleaning duty. And you know what that means.

[Cut to Hooty giggling maniacally as he plays in the mud. Cut back to the three of them shuddering.]

King: Won't be me. Life as a teen is a tyrant's dream! [to Luz] By the end of the day, I'll be ruling over your feeble demographic.

Luz: Well, I've got magic. Eda, don't be too mad when your inventory's gone and the guards are none the wiser.

[She accidentally casts a beam of light that knocks her on the ground.]

Eda: Ha! That's cute. [hops off the table] If you need me, I'll be getting pampered on a vacation fit for a king.

King: My life's not a joke! [to Luz] But yours is. [pokes Luz's nose] Bap. [laughs and runs away]

[Cut to Eda walking through town. She grabs a pair of sunglasses, puts them on and poses. Freeze frame with the words "Eda's Catastrophe" above her. She continues walking.]

Woman: Look at that little baby!

Eda: Oh, hello.

Man: So adorable!

Eda: Yes, hello to you too, handsome.

Guard: Stop right there!

[A guard with a four-headed dog is staring at her.]

Eda: An emperor's guard.

Dog: [sniffs, growls]

Guard: Thought you could get away with it, didn't you?

Eda: Wait, you know who I am?

Guard: Of course, I do. You're... the cutest little angel I've ever seen! Who wants a lolly? [holds out a lollipop]

Eda: [tosses the sunglasses and takes the lollipop] Ha! That's more like it.

Dog: [sniffs, whines]

Eda: [taunts] You got nothing! [laughs and walks away]

[The dog licks its nose where Eda hit it with the lollipop]

Eda: [sighs] Being King is a walk in the park. I'm gonna win this bet for sure. [stops walking] Wha--

Roselle: Oh, Dottie! Look at this lost little dumpling!

Eda: What's that? [is picked up] Whoa! Hey, I'm not lost, you creeps!

Roselle: Poor baby! Do you need us to make you a delicious meal?

Eda: No, I don't need you--

[Roselle scratches Eda's belly.]

Eda: Tummy scratches? Ooh. You know what? Maybe I am lost. Take me away, ladies.

[They walk down an alley, their shadows looming on the wall. Cut to a kitty café, where two creatures meow in the window and a demon with several giant eyes is painting words on the window. Roselle and Dottie carry Eda inside.]

Roselle: Welcome to our kitty café. This is our little safe haven for cherubs like you.

[Various witches and demons are playing with smaller creatures, only one of which actually looks like a cat.]

Eda: Ugh... What hot mess is going down here?

Roselle: You see, precious cargo like you should be taken care of. Boop! All you should have to worry about is how many belly rubs you want or how much tasty num-nums you're gonna eat. [puts Eda into a crib]

Eda: Well, my creep alarm is ringing, but I can't argue with num-nums. [takes the cupcake Dottie hands her]

Roselle: This place is a safe place. A place clean from the outside world. And those teenagers who filthen it. [points to a sign behind her reading "NO TEENS A-MEOW-ED"] You have a good nap, my dearest. And welcome... to your new home.

[Her and Dottie walk through the employees only door. Eda tosses the cupcake aside.]

Eda: Ha! Oh, being adorable is the life. [yawns] Time for a nap.

[She pulls out a pillow, pats it, and lays down. A shadow passes over as something meows. Eda opens her eyes with a gasp. She peeks over the edge of the crib, and Bowtie jumps up.]

Bowtie: Leave this place!

Eda: [gasps]

Bowtie: [jumps into the crib and grabs Eda by the collar] Danger is near.

Roselle: [through the door] Baby demon! We have a surprise for you!

Eda: You hear that, Bowtie? [shoves him out of the crib]

Bowtie: [grunts] Ow!

Eda: There's a new star in town.

[The door opens.]

Bowtie: [yowls and runs]

Roselle: A gift for our new, cutest demon. [holds out a bee costume]

Eda: Okay, I'm out. [crawls out of the crib and goes to the door] Novelty costumes are where I draw the line.

Roselle: Dottie, please help our little angel get changed.

[Dottie shrieks and growls, hopping on various pieces of furniture in order to stop Eda.]

Roselle: Oh, no, sweetie. You can't survive out there without us.

Eda: Ladies, stand back. I am not above disrespecting my elders. [twirls her finger; sighs] Oh, dang. I'm not a witch right now.

Roselle: No, baby. You're a cutie patootie. [reaches for Eda]

Eda: [runs] Not today, sister!

Roselle: No!

Dottie: [shrieks]

[Eda runs through the employees only door. She closes it behind her and moves a chair below the handle.]

Roselle: Let us in this instant! It is not time for you to be there.

Eda: Stop babying me!

[She turns around, then visibly gets uncomfortable. Inside the room are various demons in rocking chairs, stacked in shelves, all of them grinning ominously and most of them drooling.]

Eda: This vacation just took an alarming, back-alley turn. [waves her hand in front of one of them]

Baby: Tasty num-nums.

Eda: Ew.

Bowtie: Don't bother.

Eda: [shouts]

Bowtie: Their minds are tragically gone. They've been coddled so long, they forgot how to live on their own. Their brains turned to mush.

Eda: Geez, I thought I liked being babied. But I feel so small and helpless, like some sort of... baby. But that won't happen to us, right?

Bowtie: [purrs while playing with a ball of yarn; gurgles]

Eda: I failed you, Bowtie. My closest ally.

Bowtie: Meow. Meow. [rolls face first onto the floor]

[pounding]

Eda: [gasps]

Dottie: [growling]

Eda: I'll avenge you, Bowtie! [throws him]

Bowtie: [meows]

[Bowtie lands on Roselle's face. Dottie goes to help her. Eda sees sunlight.]

Eda: Ooh!

[She runs for the light, diving through a hole. She runs into a window.]

Eda: Huh?

Monster: [grunts and floats away]

Dottie: [snarling]

Roselle: Oh, wonderful! Now everyone can see our bestest baby... [holds up the bee costume] forever.

Eda: No!

[Cut to King successfully jumping and grabbing a flag.]

King: Weh! Not so high and mighty anymore. [throws it on the ground] I feel so alive! [yelps]

[He falls into a trashcan. Freeze frame with "KING'S BRUSH WITH DEATH" above the trash can. Action resumes as the trash can falls. A water balloon hits the ground next to the trash can. Tentacles grow out of the water.]

King: [backing away] Oh, no! [shouts and ducks] The flag, it seeks revenge.

[Distant laughing is heard. King looks to a cliff, where Skara and a Potions student are standing. The latter throws a water balloon on the ground.]

Man #1: [caught in tentacles] Help me! I'm a delicate man.

King: Teenagers.

[Cut to King pulling himself onto the cliff.]

Potions Student: [grabbing another water balloon from a bag] Hey, take this, society! [breaks the balloon over himself] Oh, no. [shouts]

[A tentacle grabs him. King crawls over to a building with signs reading "TREASURE SHACK." King sniffs under the curtain, then looks under it. Amelia and Boscha are on their scrolls while the Oracle student is flying upside down with winged boots, attempting to do a sit-up.]

Oracle Student: [groaning]

Boscha: [scoffs] Just give up.

Oracle Student: I swear, I can do a sit-up. I'm just having a bad day. [groans]

Boscha: Sure, you can.

[Amelia stands and throws a peace sign as Boscha goes over to take a picture of him struggling.]

King: I'll show Luz how to rule over these doofuses. [enters] Greetings! Er... [stands up] Greetings! Bow before your king of humans.

Oracle Student: [falls and grunts] Hey, nobody tells me what to do.

Boscha: [scoffs] Shut it.

Oracle Student: Sorry, Boscha.

Boscha: [typing on her scroll] New post: Loser human thinks she can hang out in our sacred Treasure Shack. Spoiler alert: She can't.

Oracle Student: [flying over] Yeah, get out of here, Goody Two-Shoes.

King: Goody Two-Shoes, huh?

[King steals his flying boots, making him fall on the ground. King flies out of the Treasure Shack, grabbing the bag of water balloons from Skara.]

King: Hey, impressionable youths!

[Amelia and the Oracle student walk out, them and Skara staring up at King.]

King: Under my command, you could learn how to do some real damage. Nyeh!

[He swings the bag around and throws the whole thing. Tentacles taller than the library spring forth. King spins around to face them slowly.]

King: All hail, your new teen king.

Oracle Student: I didn't like her telling me what to do before, but now, I love it.

Boscha: [huffs]

King: Who wants to revolt with me today?

Skara: Yay! You're the coolest.

Oracle Student: We love you now.

Amelia: I love it!

[Skara and Amelia fly off with King. The Oracle student looks down at his socked feet.]

Oracle Student: Uh, I'll catch up. [runs after them]

Boscha: Hold up. I did not give you permission to leave.

[Amelia flies down and picks up the Oracle student.]

King: All right, you acne-encrusted hormone buckets. Let's go let out some teen angst!

Music: ? You're hanging with the cool kids ? ? Breaking all the rules kids ? ? We're gonna have to fool the kids ? ? Into thinking that you're cool too ? ? They pierce their noses ? ? They dye their hair... ?

[As the music plays, the teens wreck havoc through town. The Oracle student shuffles the facial features of two witches waiting for the bus, making them both scream. A third lowers a newspaper to show that their face is already shuffled. King shrugs. The Oracle student shuffles their face to normal orientation. They scream. Cut to a sign that reads "SELF STORAGE." Amelia takes off the "S" and the "STO." She and the others hide behind a booth as an elf approaches the sign now reading "ELF RAGE"]

Elf: Yeah, this sign gets it!

[He grunts and rips his shirt off, then punches the sign and runs off. The teens laugh, then gasp and run off when the elf returns. Cut to them all laughing as King, holding a crow, shushes them.]

King: Guys, be quiet.

[He dials a number on the crow, which caws. Cut to the Owl House, where a crow caws repeatedly. Hooty picks it up.

Hooty: Hoot House. Hooty Hooting.

[Cut back to town, where the teens are still laughing. King tosses the crow into a megaphone.]

Hooty: Oh, wow. I've been waiting for someone to call all day, and now, it's finally happened! We can talk for hours, and hours, and hours, and hours...

Man #2: [screams]

[Cut to the teens walking through town, the Oracle student and Amelia holding bags of onion rings. The backing music stops.]

King: [laughs] I don't know what Luz is talking about. This life is a breeze. [gasps]

Boscha: Enough! I don't know why they can't remember what a weirdo loser you are, but I'm gonna help them remember.

King: Ooh, I'm so scared. [chuckles] She still thinks she has power over you guys.

[The other three are all staring at Boscha in fear.]

King: Guys?

Boscha: Luz, I challenge you to a race... around Dead Man's Curve.

[She points to a winding road held up with bones. Lightning strikes the road, knocking a chunk of it off.]

All: [gasps]

Boscha: And we'll be racing on those. [points] Giant rat worms.

King: Meh.

Skara: You don't have to do this, you know. We know humans are, like, super fragile.

King: Don't baby me! [walks up to Boscha] Boscha, I accept your strange teenaged, coming-of-age challenge thing.

[Cut to Dead Man's Curve as one of the bones supporting it crumbles. King shoves one of the rat worms to the starting line where Boscha is already sitting. Amelia pulls out an onion ring.]

Amelia: On your mark...

[King climbs onto his rat worm as Boscha smirks at him.]

Amelia: Get set...

King: [gulps]

[Amelia bites into the onion ring. Boscha's rat worm immediately takes off. King's does not.]

King: Let's go!

[Rat worm growls]

King: Worm minion, I said go!

[He smacks the worm's tail. It screams and takes off.]

King: Stop! I said stop! [screaming]

[King's rat worm rolls down Dead Man's Curve as King rides it backwards. Boscha takes the turns expertly while King bounces off of them. Despite that, he catches up.]

Boscha: [gasps]

King: This is how the cool kids ride. Super backwards. On purpose.

[Boscha growls. She faces forward and gasps, pulls her rat worm to a stop. King speeds past.]

King: Yes! Say bye-bye to your popularity, Boscha.

Boscha: [waves mockingly] Bye-bye.

[King turns around and sees a caution sign with blinking worms. He yelps and tries to stop his rat worm, but it's too late. He plows into the caution sign and plummets, destroying the Treasure Shack.]

King: [falls off the rat worm] Ow.

Skara: Not the Treasure Shack!

Oracle Student: I don't know how to process this. Someone tell me what to do!

Boscha: [smirks] Get her!

[They all take off after King.]

King: Weh!

[King runs. They follow. He slides down a hill and takes off on all fours.]

Boscha: Get back here, human!

King: Luz was right. I can't handle the complexities of teenage life. I just want my body back.

[He runs into the paint can left outside the kitty café.]

Boscha: I think I saw her go this way.

[King runs inside. The teens fly past it. King catches his breath, then sighs in relief. The lights flick on.]

King: Huh?

[Roselle stomps in.]

Roselle: Dottie! A teen has come to steal our little babies. [wields a broom]

King: No, wait! I am a little baby! [runs]

Roselle: No, you're not. You're a rotten teen! But when we finish with you, you'll be calling for your mother. [grabs knitting needles and drags them over her teeth]

King: Lady, I just want my body back.

Eda: You can have it. Your life is pretty terrible. But, hey, it'll probably be over soon.

Dottie: [snarls, tosses a bag over King]

[Cut to the market, where Luz stands up.]

Luz: Whew! Okay, let's try this again. And strut, strut, strut. [grunts]

[She falls against a box and knocks over a lamp. Freeze frame with Luz looking at the words, "LUZ'S DEALS IN HEELS." Action resumes as Luz lifts up her foot.]

Luz: How does Eda wear these all day? [sees the broken lamp] Oh, no. What have my heels done? Wait a second. I'm a ding dang witch!

[She draws a spell circle at the lamp, blasting herself into the air. She lands behind the table with a yelp.]

Luz: Boy, Eda is powerful. [yells as magic comes out of her hand] Not again!

[Cut to Luz putting oven mitts on, her pointer finger sticking out of each.]

Luz: Okay, let's try this one more time.

[She draws a spell circle over the lamp, fixing it and giving it human legs.]

Luz: [coughs, gasps] I made magic with my hands! [jumps]

Man #2: [looking at the lamp] Ooh, so unnecessarily extravagant. I'll take it.

Luz: Zippo swappo. Sold to the savvy shopper.

[She draws a spell circle and the lamp walks off. The man follows it, tossing Luz a snail.]

Luz: Okay, magic hands, let's see what else we can magically magic.

[With a snap of her fingers, a giant neon sign and spotlights appear at the stand. She is now wearing a top hat reading "EDA."]

Luz: Step right up and feast your eyes on the marvels of the human realm!

Customer #1: Oh, what is this?

Customer #2: Where did the other stand go?

Customer #3: Your lights are too bright, and I forgot what I came here for.

Luz: Was it for laughter? [magics a feather duster to tickle him]

Customer #3: [laughing] Joy! So painful. [hands her fistfuls of snails] I'll take two for my enemies.

[A centaur walks up and points to his blank human face. Luz uses a marker to draw him a face. The centaur cries with joy and piles the table high with snails. A baby wails in a carriage. A giant pacifier appears in its mouth. The baby's parent dumps an entire coin purse onto the table. Various customers leave the stand.]

Luz: Thank you! Come again! There's a little something for everyone. Take it from me, Eda, the Boiling Isles' gift to magic.

Guard #1: Is that right? You're the famous Eda the Owl Lady?

Luz: That depends. Are you a fan... [reaches into the top hat and pulls out flowers] of magic?

[The flowers make a sound effect as their eyes shine.]

Guard #1: No, but I am a fan of... [takes cloak off] the law.

Flowers: Oh, no! [wilt and die]

[The guard cuffs Luz.]

Guard #2: [approaches the stand] We were finally able to catch you in the act. All thanks to this little light show of yours.

Luz: [looks between them] Gentlemen, whaddya say we forget this whole thing ever happened? Amnesia spell!

[She summons a pacifier into the second guard's mask. He narrows his eyes.]

Luz: Haven't quite got the hang of this yet.

[Cut to a police precinct. A camera shutters, and Luz is standing in front of a height chart holding a prisoner number card.]

Camera Monster: [coughs] This is some of my best work. Really captures the shame.

[Owlbert is taken by a guard. He chirps in protest as the guard puts a ring around his wings.]

Guard #3: [laughs, slams door] Yeah, you're going away for a long time, you filthy criminal. e Owlbert: [hoots nervously]

Luz: Owlbert! This is all a big mistake. [led into an interrogation room] You're gonna laugh when I explain.

[Cut to a hallway, where Emperor's Coven guards are drinking water. A shadow passes over them.]

Guard #3: [gasps] Is it really her?

Guard #4: Oh, no. This is not good.

Guard #1: Hey, you gotta take that thing out before someone sees you.

Guard #2: I like it. Calms the nerves.

[Lilith's reflection appears in the one-way mirror.]

Guard #2: Hmm? [spits out the pacifier] Uh...

Guard #1: Madame Lilith, to what do we owe this honor?

Lilith: Word reached me that you captured my sister. I'll take it from here.

Guard #1: But Madame, she's going straight to the Conformatorium. I have the order right here.

[He pulls out a piece of paper, which burns in a blue fire.]

Lilith: The orders have changed.

Luz: Look, guys, you got the wrong Eda.

Lilith: Hello, Edalyn.

Luz: Oh, thank goodness! A familiar face. You're Eda's sister, right? Is it Libby? No. Limby...

Lilith: Your show of affection is touching. Do you know why you're here?

Luz: Well, as I was telling the guard, this is just a classic Freaky Fraturday mix-up.

Lilith: Sister, [unfurls a lengthy scroll] the charges against you are long and many. Operating a stand without a permit, owning a hocus without a pocus...

Luz: Yeah, I think that list goes on for a while.

Lilith: These charges are serious. There's no more running away, Edalyn.

Luz: I know. I can't just "poof" my problems away.

Lilith: [in a lighter tone, holding Luz's shoulders] But we can. You getting caught was clearly a cry for help. Join the Emperor's Coven, like we dreamed about when we were girls.

Luz: Eda wanted to be in the Emperor's Coven?

Lilith: Don't be afraid, sister. Soon, you won't be a danger to those around you. Bring out the branding glove.

[She summons rings of light that secure Luz to the chair.]

Luz: The what now?

[A guard puts on a glove with the logo of the Emperor's Coven on the palm. The logo glows red. He tosses the table aside and cracks his knuckles.]

Luz: Wait, you're making a mistake! [draws a large spell circle] I'm not a danger to anyone! [realizes what she did] Uh-oh.

[A wall of the precinct explodes.]

Luz: [coughs] Owlbert, come to me!

Owlbert: [hoots, flies through the gate]

Luz: Huh? Ah! [grunts as Owlbert hits her face; stands] Sorry, buddy. [frees Owlbert] Eda's life is more complicated than I thought.

[Luz runs through the hole in the wall. Lilith stands, her hair mussed.]

Lilith: [growls]

Luz: [running] Okay, if I were Eda and Eda is King, where would I be? Ah! This thing's so confusing.

Lilith: After her!

[Luz walks backwards, looking at Lilith and the guards. Knocking at a window makes her face forward. She's at the kitty café.]

Eda: Luz! Bring my dang body over here.

Luz: Eda!

Roselle: Oh, look, Dottie. It's not kidnapping if they entered our store. Just think of it as good customer service.

[Outside, Luz draws a spell circle. The lamp next to the women grows legs and several other lamp heads. Luz enters.]

Roselle: Why did our lamp get unnecessarily extravagant?

[The women turn and see Eda helping King through the hole. Everyone makes eye contact.]

Luz & King: [gasp]

Eda: Hi.

Luz: Go, go, go!

[They all run.]

Roselle: [gasps] After them!

Dottie: [shrieks and holds up a net]

[Luz, King, and Eda arrive on main street.]

Luz: What weird stuff did you get my body into?

Lilith: There she is.

Dog: [barking]

Eda: I got the same question.

[Boscha, Skara, Amelia, and the Oracle student fly in on their boots.]

King: Dang! I forgot about them.

Eda: All right. Did everybody learn a valuable lesson about experiencing each other's hardships?

King & Luz: Yep.

Eda: Good, let's end this nightmare. [takes her staff] Body swap!

[Everyone returns to their own bodies. Eda is still wearing the bee costume, though it immediately rips off. King is still in the volunteer shirt and Luz takes off the oven mitts.]

King: My body! My glorious little body!

Lilith: Sister. Time and again I've offered you my help, yet you foolishly run back to your worthless life. I'm tired of trying, Edalyn. Your days of running are over!

Eda: Thanks, Luz.

Luz: Sorry.

Eda: Don't worry, I got this. Body swap!

[She spins her staff and directs the beam at everyone while Luz and King duck.]

Lilith: [as the dog, barking] Eda, you rotten sister! Switch me back! Ah! [barks]

Guard #1: [in Roselle's body] What's happening? Who the heck are you?

Guard #2: [in Dottie's body] I'm a Coven guard, wise mouth.

Guard #1: No, you're not. I am!

Roselle: [in the Oracle student's body] You get outta my body, you galoot!

Guard #2: Fight! Ow. My knees.

Someone in Boscha's body: Hey! Ow!

Someone in the body of a guard: This is your fault. Let go! My arm! Ow!

Guard #1: [screaming]

[General mayhem ensues.]

King: Are they gonna be okay?

Eda: Eh?

Luz: Eda, I just wanna say that things can be more complicated than you think. But with you guys, it all feels a little less mixed up.

Eda: Aw, that's sweet, kid. Now, let's never speak of this again.

[Owlbert hoots as he unfurls his wings. Everyone who was body swapped clamors as Eda, Luz, and King fly off.]

Dog: [in Lilith's body] [howls]

[Cut to Eda, Luz, and King flying in front of the moon.]

Luz: So, wait. Who is going to clean Hooty? It's getting... dire.

[Cut to the Owl House, where Hooty is even dirtier than before.]

Hooty: Guys? Today's my monthly cleaning. Hoot, hoot. I'm 20% mucus, but don't let that stop you. C'mon, I have so many hard-to-reach spots that need swabbing!

[Cut back to the three flying.]

Luz: Maybe if we all work together we could--

Eda & King: Not it.

Luz: Aw, man.

Luz: So they said I couldn't remove my thumb, but look at that! [pretends to remove her thumb] Whoop!

Gus: You sliced it off! [panicked] You sliced off your own thumb!

Willow: [chuckles] You make doing homework actually fun.

Luz: And they say humans can't do magic.

King: Luz... [climbs onto table] Nyeh! You've been talking to them all morning. Don't forget about the Luz and King comedy hour!

Eda: Please, no. Not the comedy hour...

King: This week I've been working with props! [turns around to show a cardboard tube on his nose] Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose! Will I ever eat again? [slams a piece of bread on his face] Looks like I'm toast!

Luz & King: [laugh]

Eda: It just goes on like this for an hour!

Luz: Heyo, dough boy, quit loafing around!

King: Why don't you bake me?

Luz & King: [laugh]

[The crystal ball buzzes with an alarm and flashes red. The time, 8:00, flashes below Willow and Gus.]

Luz: School time! See you guys in class!

Willow: Bye!

Gus: But what about the thumb?!

[Luz ends the call.]

King: [sigh]

Luz: Hey, don't worry. We'll finish our comedy hour when we get home. [kisses King's skull]

King: Hee hee, oh you!

Luz: [singsong] Try not to miss me while I'm gone! [closes door]

King: [scrambles over to the door] You... you really think she's coming back this time?

Eda: Yes, she'll be back; she always comes back. It's cute you miss her, though.

King: The King of Demons-- [tosses bread and tube off] The King of Demons misses nobody! I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now! Wha!

[Luz comes through the door.]

Eda: Hey, you're-

King: You're back! [climbs up on Luz's head] I didn't miss you at all.

Luz: Apparently there's an infestation of pixies at Hexside, so school's been canceled.

King: That sounds like a crumby situation.

Luz & King: [laugh]

Hooty: Hey! Guess what's been in my mouth that I'm about to throw up!

[Hooty gags for several long moments. Everyone stares at him in disgust. He finally throws up letters and a box.]

Hooty: The mail!

Eda: [going through the letters] Junk, junk, death hex.

[She tosses the death hex letter into a trashcan, which condenses into a dark purple ball before disappearing entirely.]

Eda: Oh, a carnival's in town today!

Luz: A carnival? [takes King off her head] You know, I've been so busy with school lately, what do you say we take this comedy hour on tour? It'll be a Luz and King day!

King: That's my kinda day!

Luz: [puts an arm around Eda] Let's all three of us go!

Hooty: An adventure with friends! I'll go pack my stuff!

Eda: Carnivals bring crowds and crowds bring suckers. This could be the perfect chance to try out my new get-witch-quick scheme. [takes staff out of pot, knocks goop off of Owlbert] I'm in! To the carnival!

Luz & King: To the carnival!

[They all leave.]

Hooty: Good news, I'm bringing my knapsack full of games! Hello?

[A fly buzzes near him.]

Hooty: Oh, a fly! Talk to me, talk to me!

[THEME]

[Cut to the Bonesborough Carnival.]

Eda: Well, here we are, kids. Look at all that fresh meat.

[Flies buzz around a fried chicken on a stick.]

Luz: [now in her usual attire] And smell all the fresh meat! [sniffs as a fly goes up her nose; coughs it out her mouth] Fun!

Owlbert: [hoots, starts to twist off the staff]

Eda: No games for you, Owlbert, we've got scams to run.

Owlbert: [sad hooting]

Tibbles: Friends! [lands in front of them] Welcome!

[Everyone jumps into defensive poses.]

Tibbles: I see you got my postcard.

Eda: Tibbles? You sent this?

[Eda looks on the back of the flier. It reads: "To my Owl House Pals, From Tibbles," and has a picture of Tibbles dancing when Eda tilts it. She lowers it and Tibbles is doing the same dance.]

Tibbles: Mm-hmm.

Luz: Aren't you mad at us for destroying your stand?

King: Ooh, and destroying his life! That was the best part!

Tibbles: No, no, no. I should thank you. After my stand was destroyed, I reevaluated my life and found my true calling! I'm now ringmaster of... [snaps whip] Tibbles's Tent of Tiny Terrors!

[Luz approaches the terrarium containing tiny unicorns, a tiny manticore, and a tiny griffin.]

Luz: Aww. It's like a regular circus but adorably small!

Griffin: [hisses]

Luz: [presses her face to the glass] You're my friends now.

Eda: I don't buy it. [sends away her staff] What kind of con are you running?

Tibbles: No cons here, Owl Lady, only pros. In fact, why don't we toast our newfound friendship with this totally innocent bottle of water. [pulls out potion]

Eda: [takes potion; sarcastically] Oh yeah, sure! Why don't I just--

[Eda throws the bottle. It lands on an Oracle Teacher's head and knocks them on their back.]

Oracle Teacher: I'm okay!

Eda: I know poison when I see it; you can't scam a scammer! Now speaking of scams... [walks up to a stand] Beat it loser! [knocks the vendor's stuff to the ground] Step right up to... [transforms the stand] Eda's Human Horror House! Humans shed their skin and I've got proof. [pulls out fishnet stockings]

King: You should really put a lock on your closet.

Luz: You know what, Eda can pick through my socks all she wants. Because today is all about having a great time with my partner in crime.

King: That's me! I love crime!

Luz & King: [laugh, walk off]

Tibbles: Have a good time, friends. [whisper] While it lasts.

[Cut to a dunk tank.]

Abomination Student: Dunk the skeleton! Win a prize!

[A ball hits the target, dumping the skeleton into a cauldron labelled SKIN. The skeleton pops out now covered in skin.]

Skeleton: Ah! Aah! I'm covered in pores!

Luz: Now this is my kind of weird! So what do you wanna do first? We could brave the molar coaster, or eat a mysterious blob...

King: Ooh, what's that? [runs up to prize booth] Ah! Some kind of deadly string weapon.

Luz: No, silly. That's a friendship bracelet.

King: Is that a type of deadly weapon?

Luz: A weapon of love. [grabs them and puts them together, forming a heart] It's basically a declaration to the whole world that you're the best of friends.

King: Ooh! That's a safer way than becoming blood brothers! Luz, we must have those bracelets!

Prize Vendor: And yoink. [takes bracelets back] Sorry, ma'am. If your bone son wants these bracelets you'll have to play the games and win the tickets. You know, carnival rules.

King: [tugging cuff on Luz's shorts] Beat up the man and steal his things for me.

Luz: Or let's just play the games.

King: Oh, okay.

Luz & King: [laugh] Games! Games! Games! Games!

Luz: [gasps] Friends!

Willow: Luz!

Gus: Hey, Luz!

[They all hug.]

Luz: Oh my gosh, I didn't think I'd see carniv-y'all here.

Gus: Boo.

Willow: I got an invitation from Tibbles.

Gus: We figured it's a trap since we squashed his stand with a walking house.

Willow: But who cares? This place has a Scarris wheel.

Gus: It's like a human Ferris wheel but it gives you long-lasting nightmares.

Luz: Yes! This mama is ready for trauma.

King: Ahem.

Luz: Oh, yeah. We're on a very important quest to win a special prize for King.

Willow: Oh! We can help with that.

Gus: Aw. Does the little guy wanna win a prize? Uh, does he? Uh, does he? [cooing, waves his finger at King]

King: Nyeh! [knocks Gus's finger away]

Luz: What do you think, King? The more the merrier, huh?

King: Um, sure. Whatever you want, Luz.

Luz: All right. Approval!

Willow, Luz, & Gus: [cheering]

[The three of them jog away. King tries to keep up and trips. Montage: Willow rolls a skee-ball into the machine's mouth. Luz and Gus cheer her on and the three of them run off. King arrives and gets hit with the ball when the machine spits it at him; the four of them are walking when they notice a picture board. They all stick their heads through the holes, but King is stuck with being the trashcan; Luz takes a bite out of a fried orb and hands it to Willow. She takes a small bite out of it and hands it to Gus. He eats the rest of it, leaving none for King, who had been between Willow and Gus; Luz, Willow, and Gus are leaning against a stand.]

Willow: So the pixie infestation was actually caused when Boscha's pet pixie escaped its cage...

Luz: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[King jumps and grunts, trying to actually play the booth. He finally latches onto the edge of the booth but falls back.]

King: [screams, grunts] Curse these stubby legs!

Gus, Willow, & Luz: [laugh]

[King walks away. Fade to King sitting on the stoop of a narrow booth next to a poster that reads "CARNIVAL best with friends," with a drawing of three witches on it.]

King: [looks at poster, sighs]

Tibbles: [in disguise] Oh, my, my, my. You seem troubled.

King: Weh? Who said that?

Tibbles: It is I. Obvioso, the all-seeing psychic.

King: Haven't I seen you somewhere? It's almost so...

Tibbles: Obvious?

King: That's what I was gonna say. Wow! You really are psychic.

Tibbles: You're right. And Obvioso can see that something is bothering you, little friend.

King: [sighs] You got my number, Obvioso. Today was supposed to be about me and Luz, see? But now she's distracted by her cool new school friends.

Tibbles: What if I were to tell you that there was a way to make all those problems... disappear?

King: I'd say that sounds illegal. I would also say go on.

Tibbles: [ducks into booth and laughs; grabs potion bottle with spray nozzle] Behold!

[Tibbles sprays a nearby creature on a perch with the potion. It disappears in a flash of pink light.]

King: Holy bones! You poofed it. Call the cops! This guy's crazy!

Tibbles: [chuckles] Hey. The spray is only temporary. I just give my cheeks a tap and then...

[Tibbles taps his cheeks twice. The creature reappears, visibly terrified.]

Tibbles: ...it returns safe and sound.

[The creature squawks and lays an egg. The egg cracks and a baby creature chirps.]

Tibbles: Take this. [hands King the bottle] Enjoy the carnival without the problems. Luz, Willow, and Gus will be none the wiser.

King: Whoa! You even know their names. Guess there's no use arguing with a fortune-teller. Thanks, Obvioso. [walks away]

Tibbles: [laughs, takes off fake mustache]

King: Hey.

[King returns. Tibbles holds the mustache back up.]

King: Sidenote: in the future, do I ever find love?

Tibbles: Uh... yes?

King: [laughs, leaves again]

Tibbles: [sighs]

[Cut to King walking, looking at the bottle in his hands.]

King: Hmm, maybe I should think about this first.

Luz: King!

[King shoves the bottle in his fanny pack.]

Luz: Sorry we lost you back there, little dude.

King: Hey, it's okay. [grabs Luz's hand] Let's go back to the games and win those bracelets.

Gus: [grabs Luz's other hand] But we haven't gone on any rides and there's no line for the bumper carcasses.

King: Games!

Gus: Carcasses!

King: Games!

Gus: Carcasses!

[Luz's stomach growls loudly. They all look at it.]

Luz: Food! I'm gonna crab some rotten candy while you guys figure this out. [runs] Bye!

Willow: [to Gus] When Luz comes back let's go on the three-man cauldron spinner.

Gus: Or the triple swing.

Willow: Oh, and that's close to those photo booths that can fit exactly three people.

King: But today was me and Luz's day.

Gus: Aw. Does the little baby boo miss his buddy Luz? [picks King up]

Willow: [chuckles]

Gus: Uh, does he? Uh, does he?

King: [grunts] The King of Demons misses nobody.

Gus: [laughs]

King: I demand you put me down!

[The potion falls out of King's pouch. It lands on the ground and sprays Willow and Gus.]

Willow & Gus: What?

[Willow and Gus disappear.]

King: Oh, no! What have I done?

Luz: Wow. I guess they really wanted to ride those bumper carcasses.

King: Actually, Luz. There's something I gotta tell you.

Luz: No. There's something I gotta tell you, King. [pauses] I said I'd help you win those friendship bracelets. So win them we shall, okay?

King: Uh... [whisper] Willow and Gus will be okay for a little while, right?

Luz: What was that?

King: Nothing. Now let's go! [chuckles]

Luz: Ready or not, here we crumb.

King: Yes! Ha ha!

[Camera pans down to Willow and Gus, who have actually shrunk and not disappeared.]

Gus: First, I'm growing out of my clothes. Now I'm shrinking? Dang, puberty. You're the craziest coaster of 'em all.

Willow: Ugh.

Gus: [screams] What happened to us? Did I black out on the molar coaster again?

Willow: Sketchy carnival rides are not to blame this time. King had something in his pouch that made us small.

Gus: And I just got tall enough for the rides! [sobs]

[A shadow falls over them.]

Willow: Gus...

[The creature that Tibbles sprayed before is now standing in front of them.]

Creature: [roars]

Gus: Ah!

[Willow grabs Gus' hand and runs to a styrofoam cup. Willow moves it so they're standing under it.]

Gus: I think we're safe now.

[A tongue pierces the cup three times.]

Willow & Gus: [scream]

Gus: Ew! [hugs Willow]

Willow: Enough of this!

[Willow's eyes glow green. Vines sprout from the ground and grab onto the creature's tongue, trapping it on the cup. Willow and Gus run to a dropped rotten candy.]

Willow: Quick! We have to find Luz and get her attention before any more carnival animals hunt us down.

[Willow grabs some rotten candy and whistles. A fly lands and eats the rotten candy.]

Willow: Eat up, my stead. Lead us to safety. [climbs onto the fly]

Gus: It's so hairy. Why is it so hairy?

Willow: Because up close, everything is hairy. [grabs Gus and flies away]

Gus: [yelps]

[Cut to Eda's stand.]

Eda: Round as the moon, her ears are, with mood swings as terrifying as night itself. Now, [holds up a fidget spinner] who wants to touch an outdated human reference? [spins it]

[The people at her stand pull out snails.]

Citizen #1: I do.

Citizen #2: Me.

Clown Guard: Okay, show's over. This witch doesn't have a license.

Citizen #2: I can't do time again!

Citizen #1: Run!

Eda: Ah, what are you? The fun police?

Clown Guard: Yes! [squeaks badge that reads "Fun Police" And you're coming with me. [hits squeaky night stick against palm]

Eda: Uh, excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with your staff. [points empty staff at the guard; looks at the interlock] Owlbert! Owlbert! Where are you?

[Cut to Owlbert hooting happily and playing Whack-A-Giraffe.]

Eda: Owlbert, you're lucky I can't be mad at your adorable antics.

[Eda climbs over her stand and runs. Something clatters loudly. She has fallen into a rotten candy machine.]

Candy Vendor: Hey, I caught her.

[The clown guard walks over, shoes squeaking, and magically ties Eda up and pulls her out of the machine. Her hair is now covered in rotten candy.]

Eda: I hate carnivals.

[Cut to King leading Luz through the carnival. They stop at the prize booth. The friendship bracelets are still there. King drags Luz onward. Willow and Gus, on the fly, fly up from behind the friendship bracelet frame and follow them. Cut to Luz and King failing at skee-ball. Luz tickles the machines, which lets King successfully throw the ball in. Tickets spew out of the machine/monster as the two cheer. Cut to Gus poking the hairy back of the fly and recoiling in disgust. Willow directs the fly to Luz and King, but they move. The fly lands in the rotten candy machine. Cut to Luz and King at ring toss. One of the bottles hops out of the way of Luz's ring. The attendant shrugs. King shoves a ring over the attendant's body. The attendant reluctantly hands them tickets. Cut to Willow and Gus climbing onto a stand, covered in rotten candy.]

Willow: [panting]

Gus: We can't keep doing this.

Willow: [gasps]

[Camera pans to show a house of mirrors.]

Willow: We won't have to for much longer.

[Cut to Eda tied up sitting under a banner that reads "THE FUN POLICE because crime is no laughing matter."]

Eda: Just when I thought I couldn't respect the law any less...

[Shoes squeak as they're put on the desk.]

Eda: ...it surprises me.

Carnival Boss: So, I hear you're running scams at my carnival? That's my job. And I take my job very seriously. [his bow tie spins]

Eda: Spare me the yuks. What do you want?

Carnival Boss: Since I'm a forgiving demon, I'll give you two options. [gestures to Eda's wanted poster] I can pass you along to the Emperor's Coven, who'll throw you in the Conformatorium, or you can scam for me.

[He points to a dress on a mannequin and a cart of caramel crab apples.]

[Cut to the prize booth, where the vendor is counting Luz and King's tickets.]

Prize Vendor: 1230... 1231...

King: [squeals]

Luz: Now, King, before you spend your tickets are you sure you want those friendship bracelets and not this bad boy?

[Luz points to a cursed skull, whose eye glows.]

Cursed Skull: [roars] I am the King of Night. And every breath you take brings you closer to darkness.

[pause]

Luz: This guy's a riot.

King: Yes, Luz. I want the bracelets. It's kind of important to me, okay?

Cursed Skull: I can be important to you. I, who have seen the birth and death of countless nations--

Prize Vendor: [smacks the skull with a broom] Hey, stop it.

Cursed Skull: [whinnies]

Prize Vendor: No, no. Stop it. Yes, where was I, uh... Well, lost count. Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six...

[The fly drops rotten candy in Luz's hair. She feels it.]

Luz: Ugh, gross. I'm gonna need a mirror. I'll be right back, King. [leaves]

Prize Vendor: 12, 13, 14...

King: Count faster.

[Cut to outside the house of mirrors, which is being pointed to by several arrows on the ground made of rotten candy.]

Luz: Oh. There we go.

[Luz follows the arrows and enters. There are more arrows inside, leading past a wall of mirrors that alter Luz's character design in every one. She reaches the end of the arrows.]

Luz: "You made it". Aw. What a supportive sign. Wait a sec.

[Willow and Gus are reflected in a mirror.]

Luz: Supportive friends!

Willow: Wait, Luz, don't do it!

[Luz runs into the mirror and slides to the ground.]

Luz: Huh?

[Willow's reflection points down. Willow and Gus step forward.]

Luz: Oh, my gosh.

[Cut to the prize stand.]

Prize Vendor: One million. Yep, I just counted to one million. The bracelets are yours. [hands them to King]

King: Yes. Yes! Now Luz and I will share a bond as mighty as these trinkets! [laughs]

[Cut to the house of mirrors as King rounds a corner.]

King: Heya, Luz. Good news. I got the bracelets.

Luz: King...

King: Huh?

[Luz holds out her hand, on which are Willow and Gus.]

King: [yelps]

Willow: You splashed us with something to make us small.

Gus: And now I can't go on the big boy rides! You monster.

King: Y-you weren't supposed to shrink. You, you were supposed to disappear. Ooh, no. Wait.

Luz: What?

King: No, no, no. Luz, I can explain. I wanted to win the bracelets and there was this psychic, see? [holds out bottle]

Luz: [puts Willow and Gus down] That must've been what did it. Give me the spray bottle, King.

King: No, wait I-I-I gotta explain.

Luz: There's nothing to explain. [tries to take the bottle]

King: I was just trying to...

Luz: Shrink my friends?

King: I was just trying to solve my problems.

[The bottle slips out of their hands. The spray nozzles loosens, resulting in both Luz and King getting splashed with the potion.]

Luz & King: Uh-oh.

[Luz and King shrink. Willow and Gus walk up to them.]

Willow & Gus: Hi.

King: Wait, I can fix it. Obvioso showed me how. Behold. [taps cheeks several times] Why isn't this working?

Tibbles: I'd say it's working quite well.

[Cut to Tibbles approaching his Tent of Tiny Terrors while holding Luz, Willow, Gus, and King. King is still tapping his cheeks.]

Gus: Um, Luz, I think King is broken.

King: Tapping my cheeks is supposed to turn us normal. The psychic told me.

Tibbles: Oh, did he? But, what if he... lied to you from the start? [summons puff of smoke, is now wearing mustache and patting out "Obvioso's" hat] Hold on. [puts hat on] Lied to you from the start? It's different.

King: You fiend. When Obvioso finds out you stole his mustache... Oh...

Gus: [facepalms]

Tibbles: The potion was designed by me. Guess whose cheeks control it?

Luz: Why are you doing this?

Tibbles: [rips off mustache] When you destroyed my stand, you destroyed generations of Grimm Hammer history. Now it's time to pay.

[Cut to the inside of the tiny terrors' cage. which they are dropped into.]

All: [scream] Oof!

Tibbles: Welcome to the greatest show on the Boiling Isles!

Crowd: [cheers]

All: [gasp]

Tibbles: Will these witches and demon survive feeding time? Let's find out!

[Tibbles rings a bell. The tiny terrors growl as they exit their tent. One unicorn still looks friendly.]

Luz: Aw. At least he's still my friend.

[angry neighing]

Luz: That's how friends react.

Tiny Terrors: [growling, advancing]

Tibbles: You ruined my livelihood. So now, you'll feed my livelihood.

[With a twirl of his finger, a spotlight turns on. Curtains open to show the inside of the cage is magnified for the crowd's viewing pleasure. Luz, Willow, Gus, and King are backed into a corner by the manticore and a unicorn.]

Tibbles: Place your bets and enjoy the show!

Gus: Well, if I have to go, at least I'm with my best friends. And King.

[The unicorn whinnies and pounces at them. They all run. The unicorn growls.]

Eda: Caramel Crab Apples. Get 'em hot and pinchy.

Man: Hey, over here!

Eda: Yeah, yeah. [winces] Hold your spider-horses.

[Gus creates an illusion of a vacuum, causing the animals to cower. Willow summons vines to tip over a water holder. The manticore steps through the illusion vacuum. The four take cover behind the water holder seconds before the manticore runs into it.]

Luz: We've gotta--

[bang]

Luz: --find a way out of here!

[Another bang. King looks around. Unicorns bite at both ends of the water holder, making Willow and Gus flinch. Luz ducks under the manticore's claws.]

King: Ah, King, you idiot. This is all your fault. [pulls out friendship bracelets] But I think I know how to fix it.

[King runs out from cover. A unicorn watches him and chases him.]

Luz: King?

King: Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you. And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends.

[A unicorn and the manticore advance on King, growling.]

King: I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school. I just... wanna be around you!

[Luz looks surprised as King jumps and dodges all the animals and climbs to the rim of the cage.]

Student #1: No!

Student #2: Boo! Boo!

[crowd booing]

Tibbles: [from atop his pile of snails] No refunds.

Tiny Terrors: [whimpering]

King: Alright. I only have one shot. [throws friendship bracelets] Nyah!

[The bracelets land on Tibbles's cheek.]

Tibbles: Darn flies. [taps cheek] Oh, no.

[King, Luz, Willow, and Gus all begin to glow. Cut to Eda.]

Crowd: [booing]

Eda: Hey, hey. No discounts, buddy.

Man: You guys owe me. There's nothing happening in this show.

Man #2: Not a single one of those dumb kids have gotten hurt yet.

Eda: Dumb kids? [turns and sees the screen] Wait. Those are my dumb kids!

[Luz, Gus, Willow, and King grow back to normal size.]

All: [share look, sigh]

[Behind them, the animals also grow to full size.]

Luz: You shrunk the animals too?

Tibbles: It's the Tent of Tiny Terrors. Something needed to be tiny.

Crowd: [booing]

Man: Finish the job! Get them kids.

Student #3: Feast!

[The student throws a crab apple at the buff unicorn, which catches and eats it. The unicorn looks happy. All animals turn to the crowd, growling. Two audience members share a look. The buff unicorn whinnies and raises a hoof. The animals charge forward. The crowd screams and flees.]

Tibbles: They foiled my plans. You will pay for this! [pulls out another bottle] This time I'm gonna personally squash you!

Eda: [takes bottle] Oh, no, Tibbles. That's not how entertainment works. [tosses bottle] The bad guy always gets his just desserts. [dumps the crab apples on him]

Tibbles: Oh, no! Not desserts!

Eda: [to the animals] Hey, girls. This one's on the house.

[The unicorns chase Tibbles out.]

Willow: Looks like we ruined his life for a second time.

Gus: We're on a roll.

King: Gus, Willow, you're okay!

Luz: All thanks to you, King. [kneels down] Here. [hands him four cracked pieces of the bracelets] It was all that was left.

King: [takes them] It's... it's okay. Because now there's a piece for everybody. [holds two out to Willow and Gus] If you'll accept it, that is?

Willow: Thank you, King.

Gus: Yeah. I've always wanted to own a jagged piece of cheap metal.

Luz: That's very sweet.

King: I'm sorry, Luz. Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody.

Luz: [whisper] And can I tell you a secret? I've been missing you too. [kisses]

King: [giggles] Hey, we still have a few hours of carnival left. Wanna hit those bumper carcasses?

Luz: You bread my mind.

King: [laughs] Yes! Bread puns. Bread puns forever.

Luz: You coming, Eda?

Eda: [laying on Tibbles's pile of snails] Nah. I think I got everything I wanted.

[The stands collapse behind Eda.]

Eda: Yep. Another great year at the carnival.

[Cut to the Owl House, where Hooty is talking to the fly.]

Hooty: Boy, fly, we sure get into some wacky hijinks, don't we?

[The door opens, King, Eda, and Luz peek in.]

Hooty: Sure feel sorry for anyone that missed seeing us two rabble-rousers getting into scrapes.

[Luz, Eda, and King all duck back out, closing the door.]

Hooty: Good thing I brought a camera. Yep. Hooty and fly. Together forever. You and me. Every single day-- [coughs as the fly enters his mouth] Now I know what friendship taste like. Yum. Taste like a bug.

Gus: Behold. The wonders of the human realm. [picks up the paper clip] This little fella's one of their most valued objects. It aids in the compiling of printed wisdom, the scratching of gunk from under your nails, and my favorite... It even mimics the sounds of the human ocean.

[He proceeds to twang it.]

Gus: Aah! The human realm. So beautiful. [walks over to the chalkboard] It's safe to say that the pay-per-clorp is a stunning testament to human ingenuity. Any questions?

[He turns around to face the rest of the club. Eileen, Bo, and the unicorn Bard track student are all falling asleep, and Mattholomule looks thoroughly bored. He raises his hand.]

Gus: Ah! Our newest member: Mattholomule.

Mattholomule: A-Augustus, is this what the president of the Human Appreciation Society thinks passes as "Human Artifacts"?

[Gus looks confused.]

Mattholomule: Because at my old school, [pushes aside Gus's stuff] we had real treasures.

[Mattholomule empties his bag onto the desk, dumping out a rock painted to look like a cell phone, an egg with a skull painted on it, and a shoe made out of mud, leaves, and twigs. They're labelled "cellular phone," "human skull," and "sports footwear" respectively. The other members of the club gasp and lean closer to them.]

Bo: So real.

Boy: Wow!

Bo: I-- I wanna touch them.

Mattholomule: Go ahead. In my club, we didn't have any dumb rules.

Gus: [gasps and turns to his list of rules] Shh. He didn't mean that.

[Gus glares at everyone touching Mattholomule's objects, then takes them away.]

Boy: Hey!

Bo: What?

Eileen: [grunts]

Gus: Well, this isn't your club. Thankfully.

Mattholomule: Exactly, who thinks I should be president?

Eileen: I do!

Bo: Mattholomule for prez.

Boy: I'm an undecided voter. I wanna touch all the objects first.

[Eileen and Bo talk over each other as Gus picks up the "phone."]

Gus: These are fakes.

Bo: [gasps] What?

Mattholomule: [stammers] You can't prove that! [inhales] You're just trying to distract these human appreciators. You're afraid of getting kicked out of office. It's your word versus mine.

Eileen: [mumbling]

Bo: I don't know what to believe in anymore.

Boy: My faith in Gus has been broken.

[Gus walks backwards into the chalkboard. He looks at a newspaper clip with a picture of Luz on it.]

Gus: What if I brought in an expert?

Mattholomule: Yeah, right. Who can you find that's a bigger human expert than any of us?

Gus: How about a real human?

Eileen: [mumbling]

Bo: Why the secrets?

Boy: Show don't tell, man.

Mattholomule: Yeah. Uh-huh. A-And you've never brought your friend here. Why?

Gus: Well, she's busy. She's got a job. But I'll bring her in tomorrow. She'll prove I'm right.

Mattholomule: [scoffs] Ah, sure you will, Augustus. Sure you will.

[Gus grows visibly nervous.]

[THEME]

[Cut to the Owl House living room, where Luz and Eda are rummaging through boxes. King is laying on the couch and Gus is standing in front of Luz.]

Luz: Gus, I'd love to go to school with you, but I don't know how I can. [points to her banned poster] Principal Bump banned me from Hexside.

Eda: But nothing. Bump did you a favor. There ain't nothing for you at that dweebus factory. [to Gus] No offense, dweebus.

Gus: It's okay. I come from a long line of dweebuses.

[Luz slams the box she's holding down, making it clatter. She stands and looks at Eda.]

Luz: Well, I would love to go some day. Better than unpacking boxes in the Eda Coven.

Eda: Oh, you think you're clever, huh? [stands]

King: Ooh! Fight, fight, fight!

Eda: Can it, King! First off, it's the "Bad Girl Coven" and second off, I guess you don't want in on the T-shirt order, huh?

[She pulls out a piece of paper with a t-shirt drawn on it as rock music plays.]

Luz: I don't care about T-shirts, Eda! I want to learn magic, [gestures to Gus] and they teach that at Hexside!

Eda: I mean, yeah, well, [grunts, leaves]-- I don't wanna hear another word about Hexside, unless it's "Hexside is on fire" and "let's grab front row seats"!

[door slams]

King: Aw, look what you did. I'm gonna go rub it in. Nyeh! [laughs, leaves]

[door opens] [door slams]

Luz: [sighs and sits on the couch]

Gus: L-Luz, a-about the ban, I, uh, used my H. A. S. presidential authority to pull some strings. You've been given a full pardon!

Luz: You mean...

Gus: I got the ban lifted!

Luz: Oh my gosh. [shakes Gus] Yes, yes, yes!

Gus: [grunting]

Luz: Of course I'll be there tomorrow! Gus, this will be great! [jumps on the couch] I get to see the school and save the president.

Gus: Great! I'll see you tomorrow!

[Gus leaves.]

Gus: Yes! You did it, Gus! [dances] ? You did it, Gus ? ? You're the smartest You're the best ?

Hooty: Sweet moves, little dude.

Gus: [yelps] I always forget you're there.

Hooty: I forget I'm here too. Boop.

Gus: [stares at Hooty] This is gonna work out after all.

[Cut to Willow and Gus standing outside of Hexside the next day.]

Willow: This isn't gonna work out at all.

Gus: Well, I feel like I took care of any potential problems.

Willow: You lied to our best friend and told her you got the ban lifted. That seems like a potential problem to me.

Gus: You don't understand. The members were going mad. They were bloodthirsty. They were touching objects. I had no choice!

Willow: Really? What about all the wanted posters around school?

Gus: [pulls the wanted posters out of his bag] What wanted posters? I also got this. [pulls out a cowl] To keep her undercover.

Luz: Undercover from what?

[Gus slams the cowl backwards over her head as she squeaks.]

Gus: Behold your new cowl.

Luz: Whoa. I love it.

[Gus turns the cowl around and pulls the hood down.]

Luz: [sniffs] On the Boiling Isles, new things smell old.

Gus: Yep. Put it on. Hide your ears. [chuckles] Wanna keep you under wraps 'till the big reveal.

[Willow frowns.]

Luz: Oh, a showman. I totally get it. You bring the razzle, [pulls the hood back up] I'll bring the dazzle.

[Luz throws handfuls of confetti. Willow and Gus stare at her.]

Willow: Do you always have confetti on you or...

[Gus's watch demon screams and bites his arm. He pokes it in the eye to make it stop.]

Gus: That's my alarm. Uh, we better get going. [drags Luz away] See you after school, Willow.

Luz: Bye, friend. Be safe. Make good choices.

Willow: Oh, Gus. I hope you know what you're doing.

[Cut to the Owl House, where Eda is moping outside.]

Eda: I'm trying to protect her. Hexside chews up anything unique and spits out bland mush. [rips apart a flower]

[insects buzzing]

Hooty: I chew insects. I turn them into mush.

Eda: But that's my beef. Does she need to draw her own conclusions?

Hooty: My beef is insects. They're what I eat.

Eda: You're just gonna be unhelpful, huh?

Hooty: All I know is, you taught me and I turned out just fine.

[He sticks out his tongue in an attempt to get the fly walking next to his head, making a gagging sound. Eda watches in concern.]

Eda: I gotta get that girl into school.

[Cut to the hallways of Hexside. A Beast Keeping witch's backpack flies off of him.]

Student #1: Whoa! [grunting] Hey! Give that back!

Student #2 & Student #3: [laughing, floating the backpack between them]

Student #2: Huh? Whoa! [straining]

[He's dragged away by a hook to the school guards.]

School Guard: [sniffing] Trouble.

[The first student's backpack falls to the ground as the third backs away nervously. He is also caught by a hook.]

Student #3: Huh? [grunts] No! Detention!

Student #2: [being dragged away] The only thing I'm guilty of is being too real!

Luz: That's new.

Gus: Well, they kinda showed up after your last visit. They smell trouble. Literally.

School Guard: Trouble.

Gus: [chuckles] Okay, time to run for no particular reason.

[Gus runs into Mattholomule. All of Luz's wanted posters and his president crown fall out of his bag.]

Gus: [gasps, grunts as he collects the posters]

Mattholomule: Augustus, you should really watch where you going. Don't want the president of the H. A. S. getting hurt on his last day in office. [picks up and dusts off the crown; looks at Luz] This must be your human. Hmm. Looks like another witchling to me.

Gus: Psst. Psst! [pulls his ears] Dazzle.

Luz: Oh. [trumpets, pulls the hood down] Ta-da!

Mattholomule: [gasps] A human!

Gus: Not just any human. An expert human.

Luz: Yeah. I've been doing this for years.

Gus: She's here to authenticate your treasures. [takes his crown back, walks past Mattholomule] See you at the meeting.

Mattholomule: Oh, no, no, no, no! [sinks to the floor] They can't know I lied. Then they'll never make me president. Huh? [picks up one of the wanted posters Gus didn't; laughs] Ooh, Gus, I have you now.

[Cut to outside of Hexside, where Eda is staring up at the building as wind howls.]

Eda: Ugh. I had this nightmare before.

[She walks inside. Cut to a hallway.]

Gus: As president of the H. A. S., I should feel bad about dunking on one of our own members. But as a Gus I feel like doing this: [dances] ? Oh, oh, yeah ? ? Oh, yeah, what, oh ?

[Luz walks over to a trophy case.]

Luz: Wow! Who got the trophy for the most bones?

School Guard: [sniffs]

[Gus runs in and drags Luz away.]

Luz: Whoa!

Gus: We don't have time for this right now. We gotta get to the clubroom.

Luz: Okay. But next time you have to give me a full tour.

Gus: Yeah, next time. [laughs]

[They stop when they see the abomination professor.]

Luz: Ooh. It's the abomination professor. I should introduce myself. Apologize for the incident. Hey, Mr. Abomination Professor. The "abominominator." Remember me? [roars]

[He raises an eyebrow at her.]

Gus: Oh, wouldn't you know? We suddenly have time for a full tour of Hexside.

[Gus pushes Luz away. Cut to Principal Bump's office, where Eda takes a pencil out of a mug.]

Eda: Been quite a while since I've sat here, huh?

[She puts the pencil on her top lip and reclines in the chair, crossing her feet next to Principal Bump's name plate. He stares at her shoes.]

Eda: I gotta admit it's extra weird without you yelling at me for picking fights or stealing.

Principal Bump: I can easily change that. [magically shoves Eda over]

Eda: [grunts] Ow!

Principal Bump: [moves his name plate back] What are you doing here, Edalyn?

Eda: [sits up; inhales as she fixes her hair] I want to-- Prft! I want to enroll my human, Luz, at Hexside. And before you get all judgy--

Principal Bump: That's not a bad idea.

Eda: You no-good-- Wait, really?

Principal Bump: [walks over to a file cabinet] I think the student body could learn a lot from having such an exchange student.

[Eda grins.]

Principal Bump: But before I even consider that, there's a lot to be answered for.

[Eda reclines on the desk again. Principal Bump magically turns her upside down without looking. He pulls a stack of files out of the cabinet.]

Eda: Oh right. Yeah. [rights herself] I heard all about that abomination incident.

Principal Bump: Oh, I'm not talking about Luz. I'm talking about the necrotic experiments, the graffiti, the scams, the cheating, Miss Jenkinmeyer's teeth.

[Eda sinks down in the chair.]

Principal Bump: The trouble you caused when you were here, Eda.

[He drops the pile of paper and books onto the desk. Eda looks at the page on top, which reads, "PERMANENT RECORD --~-- EDALYN CLAWTHORNE".]

Eda: Huh. I thought there'd be more.

[Cut to the Grudgby pitch, which has basketball hoops on either side. Skara is on the pitch while Gus and Luz are in the stands.]

Gus: This is where we play the sport.

[Skara runs at the ball, but is picked up by a griffin.]

Skara: [screaming]

Griffin: [screeching]

Skara: I hate this game! [screams]

[The griffin drops her into one of the basketball hoops. A horn blares. Gus and Luz applaud.]

School Guard: [sniffing]

[Gus sees the guard and drags Luz away. Cut to the two of them walking past a door, Luz doubling back to look through the window.]

Luz: Ooh. What's in here?

Gus: The Plant Homeroom.

[Various students in Plant uniforms are tending to the greenery. A carnivorous plant eats Amelia, who had been standing next to it with a clipboard. Willow runs over and tickles the plant's stem. It laughs and spits Amelia back up. She gives Willow a thumbs-up.]

Luz: Willow, hey.

[Willow turns around and waves at Luz. Gus looks through the window.]

Gus: Hi.

[Willow's face falls. She shakes her head.]

Gus: Bye.

[Gus drags Luz away again. Cut to a room full of mirrors.]

Gus: And this is where I spend my time. The Illusion Track Homeroom.

[The professor evaluates three students' illusions. Emira doubles the length of her legs. Edric changes his face, outfit, and hair style. The third student is shaking as they draw their spell circle and accidentally remove their facial features.]

Illusion Student: [mumbling]

[The professor draws a spell circle and their face returns.]

Illusion Student: [inhales deeply]

Luz: Wait, if you're here, who is that?

[She points across the hall, where another Gus is sitting in a class.]

Gus: That's one of my illusions. Takes notes for me when I'm not around.

[His illusion gasps and holds up a paper reading "I'm not paying attention." He laughs as he points to it.]

Gus: He doesn't always do what he's told.

Luz: Wow, Gus. You're good.

Gus: Yeah. I moved up a couple grades.

[Gus's watch screams again.]

Gus: Oh! Time for the H. A. S. meeting.

[Luz and Gus run off. Gus's illusion watches them, growing nervous when Gus returns. He mimes decapitation and casually walks away. The illision starts paying attention to class.]

[Cut to the H.A.S. room.]

All: [banging on the table] Human, human! Human, human!

Gus: Human Appreciation Society... [twangs the paper clip] ...it is my distinct pleasure to introduce to you...

[Luz moonwalks into the doorway, spinning around and almost falling.]

Luz: Oh! [recovers, takes the hood off]

Gus: Luz, the human.

Eileen: [squeals]

Bo: Such showmanship.

Boy: She's horrifying.

[Luz and Gus approach the desk. Mattholomule grows nervous.]

Gus: Luz, will you inspect the items?

Luz: Of course, Mr. President. Allow me to determine if they're truly of my realm's origin. [reaches for the "shoe"]

Mattholomule: Stop!

[He knocks his fakes off the table with a grunt. Everyone else gasps.]

Mattholomule: Don't make another move, human! [jumps onto the table; calms down] I... have something to say. I'm new here at Hexside. M-Making friends has been hard so I lied. They're all fakes.

Bo: [gasps]

Mattholomule: I thought if I was important enough people would like me. But I've caused enough drama.

[Luz and Gus share a look.]

Mattholomule: So, I'll go. I'm sorry.

Luz: Hey, man. It's okay. You're only human. Well, you know what I mean.

Gus: Mattholomule, you aren't alone. You have a place here in the H. A. S.

Boy: You're not alone.

Bo: We admire your honesty.

Boy: You're one of us.

Mattholomule: Thanks, guys. I knew you'd understand.

[Cut to a hallway.]

Eda: [grunts] I don't wanna do this!

Principal Bump: There's the whiny rebel teen I remember. You'll need this [hands her a mop] to clean up all the hexed graffiti you left us. Good luck. [leaves]

Eda: [sticks her tounge out at him] Meh!

[Eda puts the mop in the bucket and attempts to wipe away graffiti on lockers that reads "EDA RULES BUMP EATS STINK." The graffiti avoids the mop. She tries again, it moves again. She tries slower, it moves slower. She tries to wipe the entire row of lockers, only succeeding in making all the graffiti combine and now read, "MOTHER NOOOO!!!" She slams at that, and it moves again]

Eda: [groans]

[Cut to the H.A.S. room as half of them leave, waving to Luz, who waves back.]

Bo: Thanks for coming.

Boy: Come back soon.

Eileen: [muffled] Thank you. [unintelligible muttering]

Mattholomule: Hey, Augustus, Luz, thank you for being so forgiving.

Luz: We've all been the new kid before. Right, Gus?

Gus: Yeah.

Mattholomule: Well, I just have one thing to say...

[Door bangs open, school guards step in.]

Mattholomule: [points at Luz] There she is! [pulls out Luz's wanted poster] She's the intruder!

School Guard: [sniffing] Trouble.

Luz: No, it's fine. The ban's been lifted. Tell 'em, Gus. [screams as she's dragged away] Gus! Tell them!

Mattholomule: Oh, who's the liar now, Augustus?

[Cut to the Plant homeroom, where Willow is watering the carnivorous plant.]

Willow: Maybe I've been too hard on Gus. I mean, what trouble could they get into?

Luz: Help!

Carnivorous Plant: Huh?

[The plant and Willow turn to the door. Through the window, they can see Luz being dragged off.]

Luz: [screams] I don't even learn here!

Willow: Luz!

[Cut to the hallway.]

Luz: Where are you taking me?

School Guard: Detention.

Luz: Oh. That won't be so bad, right?

[They stop in front of a giant door with three closed eyes. The eyes open, red and yellow, and the bottom of the door lifts up to reveal a mouth filled with sharp teeth.]

Luz: [screams]

[Cut to the H.A.S. room, where Gus is shaking with anger.]

Mattholomule: I can't believe you two fell for that. Like I'd actually apologize.

Gus: What. Did you. Do?

Mattholomule: [mockingly] Ah, boo-hoo. I'm sorry. "I am the new kid." "I want friends." [normal] Ha! No. I want power. And I want drama. And I got one of those right now. So, what are you gonna do, Mr. President?

Gus: [prepares to punch him] Executive action. [grabs the bell's tongue]

Bell: Ow! [screams, rings]

[Water is launched from the bell and soaks Gus and Mattholomule. Cut to the two of them being dragged away by a school guard.]

Mattholomule: But I didn't pull the alarm! It was Augustus! Are you even listening to me? I demand justice!

[Willow peeks around a corner as they pass. Cut to the door to detention growling and opening its mouth again as Gus and Mattholomule are thrown inside.]

Gus & Mattholomule: [grunt]

Mattholomule: Wait!

[Door growls and closes.]

Mattholomule: [bangs on the door] Get me outta here! Open up!

Gus: Luz!

Luz: [hiding behind a rock] Gus! You said the ban was lifted!

Gus: Well, I--

[He tries to stand, but the ground cracks open at his feet. The crack widens until nearly the whole room is a hole, revealing teeth, eyes, and blue tendrils and pods, inside of which are students.]

Luz: [screams]

[Cut to the cafeteria as the doors open and a cloud of fog rolls in. Eda enters, ghosts falling onto the floor behind her. She dumps a writing bag at Principal Bump's feet.]

Eda: [strains] There. The girls' changing room is ghost-free.

Principal Bump: Are you ready to give up? [takes a ghost out of Eda's hair] You've barely scratched the surface.

Eda: [growls]

[She turns and sees Bo helping Skara with a spell.]

Bo: No, like this.

[Bo summons a ball of fire, which turns into a snowball that splats onto the table.]

Skara: [gasps] Oh. [does the same] Wow.

[They hug.]

Skara: Friendship is the real magic.

Eda: They're just as bad as Luz. She'd love it here. [turns back to Principal Bump] All right. What's next, Bumpikins?

Principal Bump: [grins and holds up a plunger]

Eda: [groans]

[Cut to detention.]

Luz: How is this detention? This is a death sentence!

Gus: I don't know! I've never been in detention before!

Mattholomule: Welcome to my world. Believe it or not, at my old school I was in detention plenty of times.

Luz: That isn't hard to believe. You're kind of a jerk.

Mattholomule: Well, down in detention, this jerk is king. So, if you wanna get out, you better do exactly what I say. [walks forward] But first, before anything else, we gotta-- [yelps]

[A snake rises out of the hole. It wraps a blue tendril around Mattholomule's ankle.]

Mattholomule: [grunts] Already? [screams as he's dragged down]

Luz: Mattholomule! [to Gus] You lied to me. You lied about the ban! Why?

Gus: I was afraid. I acted stupid.

Luz: Yes, you did!

Gus: Being younger than everyone is hard. [makes his way over to Luz] You're overlooked. Ignored. But at the H. A. S. I mattered. I could make sure no one would ever get left behind. I didn't wanna lose that. I'm sorry.

Luz: [puts a hand on his shoulder] I get it. I just wish you told me the truth.

[Gus smiles at her. Snakes hiss, several of them slithering up the hole.]

Gus: Let me make it up to you, Luz. I've got a plan.

[A snake hisses as it rises out of the hole.]

Luz: [yelps] Ya! [kicks it] I'm in. Where do we start?

Gus: [grabs her hand] By leaving no one behind. [grunts and jumps in the hole]

Luz: [screams]

[They land on an eye and bounce, both grunting when they hit the ground. They stand and pull down the pod Mattholomule's in.]

Voice: You will be a good student.

Mattholomule: I will be a good student.

Luz: [tries to bite the pod] You know, it didn't taste as bad as I thought it would. Oh, you're a witch. Do magic.

Gus: Oh, I'll use magic. [pulls out the paper clip and bends it] Human magic. [grunts]

[He cuts the pod and pulls it to the ground, freeing Mattholomule.]

Mattholomule: Am I a good student?

Luz: [strains, tosses Mattholomule over her shoulder] Oh, gosh. He's so little.

[Several snakes hiss as they surround the three of them.]

Luz: This is part of the plan, right?

Gus: Or the illusion of a plan.

[He draws a spell circle, then puts his hand in it and drags it through the air. Several other spell circles appear, and from them several clones of Luz and Gus. A snake flicks its tongue at one illusion of Gus, making it disappear. It hisses.]

Luz: A genius and a wordsmith.

[Gus picks up a giant bone and the two climb out of the hole. Snakes hiss as the follow. Gus reaches the top first, taking Mattholomule from Luz. Luz kicks a snake in the face when she pulls herself up, then spins and kicks another. Gus hits a third with the bone, then runs.]

Gus: We're gonna have to bust down the door.

Luz: Right behind you. [picks up Mattholomule and follows him]

[Three snakes follow them out of the hole, hissing. Luz takes hold of the bone, and they both run for the door.]

Luz & Gus: [screaming]

Snakes: [hissing]

Luz & Gus: [screaming]

[Cut to outside of detention, where Willow is sneaking to the door. She strains to lift the crossbar off the door, managing to get it half off before freezing when she hears Eda.]

Eda: I washed off all the graffiti. Apologized to Jenkinmeyer for stealing her teeth. Caught all the wild cerebi. Ah, we should be good.

Principal Bump: [shakes Eda's hand] It will be very exciting to have a real human exchange student.

Eda: And you won't tell the Emperor's Coven about this, will you?

Principal Bump: No. Hexside School is safe for you both. I'm the principal, not a stooge. Consider your pupil our pupil.

[Banging interrupts them. Willow backs away from the door as it's hit again from the inside. A third hit shatters the door, and Gus and Luz burst through.]

Luz & Gus: [panting]

Luz: Eda?

Eda: Guess who got you into Hexside!

Luz: What?

Snakes: [hissing]

Luz: [screams]

Principal Bump: [snaps]

Snake: [freezes] Uh, sorry, Principal Bump. Sir. [retreats]

Prinicpal Bump: [to Luz] What did you do?

Eda: [facepalms] Ugh, kid.

Principal Bump: [to Eda] To think that any student of yours would be capable of doing anything but create chaos... Eda, take your student and leave! You are both banned from this campus!

Eda: [grunts] Come on, kid. Let's go.

[Eda and Luz start to leave.]

Gus: Wait, Principal Bump. Don't blame Luz. I told her the ban was lifted. We were fighting over the Human Appreciation Society. I brought Luz in because I wanted to win. This is all my fault.

Principal Bump: If that's so, Augustus, would you be willing to accept her punishment as your own?

Gus: Yes, Principal Bump. I would.

Eda: Huh. Dang, dweebus.

Principal Bump: Very well. [to Luz] In light of that, barring any more trouble, you shall officially be enrolled in Hexside School next semester.

Luz: [gasps]

Eda: Uh, hold on. Hold on.

[She puts her hands on Luz's shoulders, then glares at Principal Bump and gestures for him to step back. He takes exactly two steps back. Eda kneels down in front of Luz.]

Eda: I'm only doing this because I have faith in you. And I know you're too smart to fall for that One-Witch, One-Coven nonsense. You can learn a lot from the witches here. [looks over her shoulder and smirks] And maybe teach them some of that Bad Girl Coven magic too.

Principal Bump: I didn't hear that. [to Gus] As for you, I would be saying detention right now but that seems to be out of order. So, as of now, I'm removing you from the Human Appreciation Society. [takes Gus's crown]

Mattholomule: Does that make me president?

Principal Bump: Impressive. Still alive. Yes, I suppose you are. [throws the crown on Mattholomule's head]

Mattholomule: [weakly] Yes!

Principal Bump: Now, with that accomplished, Eda, we have some paperwork to fill out.

Eda: Wait! I gotta do more stuff? Ugh! [to Luz] You better enjoy this place, kid.

[Luz grins and looks at her friends.]

Gus: Wanna finish off that tour?

Willow: I can show you guys what plants not to touch in the greenhouse. And then I can let you touch them.

Luz: Yeah! Let's go.

[The three join hands and laugh as they run off.]

Mattholomule: Hey! Wait. Take me. I'm your president. Oh. Come on.

[Cut to Eda's permanent record. Pages are flipped through as a song plays.]

Song: ? Why can't you remember ? ? Why can't you remember me? ? ? Oh, no, no, no ? ? Yeah ? ? Why can't you remember ? ? Why can't you remember me? ? ? Oh, no ? ? Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh Ooh, yeah ?

[Eda's permanent record includes letting loose a pack of feral ghosts in the girls' locker room, starting an abomination food fight at lunch, hexing the school bells to play pop songs, letting in "two giant bug-things" that destroyed classrooms, and feeding the school griffin spicy snacks until it threw up over the Grudgby field.]

[Cut to the Owl House living room, where Luz and Eda are going through Eda's record.]

Luz: [to Eda] Wow! Bump was not exaggerating. You were a terrible student. [Eda gives off a look of surprise, implying she didn't even know Luz was there.]

Luz: I-I'm not ready for this Eda. Maybe we should go back.

Eda: Nah kid, you got this, just do what we practiced!

Luz: But what if... What if I mess something up? Or what if I do something wrong? [gasps] What if I die?

Eda: Hey. Calm down, calm down. I had to do the same thing when I was a witchling. It's like a rite of passage. Granted, I was a little more skilled.

Luz: Eda!

Eda: Right, right. Sorry, sorry. Now, get pumped.

Luz: Pumped!

Eda: Get ready.

Luz: [pulls hood up] Ready!

Eda: Now, go! [shoves her]

[Cut to the stage, a spotlight aimed at the closed curtains and a banner reading "Hexside School: Entrance Exams." The curtains open. Luz jumps on stage in a dark cloak.]

Luz: [movie trailer narrator voice] From the humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise. [normal voice] I have traveled from another realm and trained with a powerful witch to master dark and forbidden magic. I am... [takes cloak off with a twirl] Luz Noceda!

[Reveal the audience, which is empty except for Principal Bump sitting in the front row with a clipboard.]

Luz: [chuckles awkwardly, tosses confetti out of a fanny pack] Confetti!

Principal Bump: Right. The human that wants to be a witch. Against my better judgement, I've allowed you to take this exam into Hexside. But can you even do magic with all your... human parts?

Luz: I sure can. [zips open fanny pack] It's said that humans can't do magic, [pulls out papers and shows them to both sides of the auditorium] but I discovered a lost technique that changes everything.

Principal Bump: Hmm?

[Eda gives two thumbs-up from backstage. Luz activates the light glyph and lets the ball rise. She moves the ice glyph under the light and activates it. Luz beams and does jazz hands.]

Principal Bump: Spells cast with paper? I've never heard of such a thing. [to himself] But is it enough to pass the exam?

Luz: Uhh...

Eda: Improvise.

Luz: Um, I can do other things, what about... this? [stands, flips eyelids inside out] Bleep, bloop, bleep!

[Principal Bump is not impressed.]

Luz: Ow ow! Eyelash! Eyelash!

[Luz slips on the melted ice pillar and falls into her abandoned cloak. She stands and tries to free herself, falling off the stage and onto Principal Bump. She rolls off him.]

Luz: Sorry, sorry, sorry! [places hand on an ice glyph] Whoops! AH!

[The ice pillar lifts her up by one foot until she's eye level with Principal Bump.]

Luz: I failed, didn't I?

Principal Bump: Believe it or not, I've seen worse.

Luz: [falls on her face]

Principal Bump: Welcome, Luz, to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics! [drops pamphlet on her head]

Luz: [weakly] Hurray.

[THEME]

[Cut to Eda and Luz flying on Eda's staff. Luz is wearing a Hexside uniform, though the normal uniform part is lighter than most and her sleeves and leggings are very light gray.]

Luz: Mmm, we gotta go back. This was a mistake! I'm gonna mess things up again and everyone will see, and-

Eda: Right, you gotta calm down. What are you nervous about? You've been to school before.

Luz: That's why I'm nervous! At my human school, I didn't make a good first impression. This is a chance to be seen as something other than a screw-up.

Eda: Hey, don't worry about what those dorks think. If you want my advice, walk into class and punch the first kid you see. To establish dominance.

Luz: Aw, I won't be doing that. But thanks.

[They land at Hexside. Luz dismounts.]

Eda: Last chance to back out, and earn a new Bad Girl Coven patch. [holds up a patch that reads "Quitter Badge"] Quitting: It's like trying, but easier.

Luz: Nah, I'll just earn it when I quit showering. Bye! [runs off]

Eda: Hold up! [throws hand at Luz's head to turn her around] Just try not to be too much of a goody Luz shoes. [screws hand back on] You got this.

Luz: Thanks, Eda. In fact, [pulls sock puppets of her and Eda out of her pockets] I have written a heartfelt sonnet to commemorate this occasion.

Eda: [flying away] Whoops! A gust of wind just got me. See you after school! Byeeee!

Luz holding Puppet Eda: You're gonna do great, kid.

Luz: Thanks, Puppet Eda.

[Cut to a banner reading "WELCOME TO THE NEW SEMESTER". Various students are arriving at Hexside. Luz looks around with a smile on her face. Amity and an abomination come up to her.]

Amity: [her abomination mirroring her movements] Hey, Luz! Congrats on getting in. And not being in the baby class.

Luz: Thanks, Amity! Up top!

[Amity high-fives Luz. Amity's abomination slaps Luz's face, leaving abomination mud behind. Amity and her abomination walk off.]

Luz: [wipes mud off her face] Blegh! Wow, my first day at Hexside. A chance to discover my true magical potential. And maybe meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman.

King: Dream on!

Luz: King?

King: [pops out of Luz's backpack] Boop! [jumps to the ground]

Luz: Why are you in my bag?

King: You're a free ride to the best buffet in town! Nyah! [hops into trash can, comes out with a half-eaten donut] The trash cans here are filled with half-eaten gold!

Luz: Okay, but if anyone asks, you don't know me. [walks away]

King: Have a wonderful school day, person-I-don't-know!

Abomination Student: I really needed to hear that.

[Cut to the main staircase.]

Willow & Gus: Luz!

Luz: Hello, fellow Hexoleos!

Willow: Hello, classmate! [winks]

Gus: You did it, Luz! [summons letters reading out "BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!" Willow glares at him] Sorry, I was, uh, covering all my bases.

Willow: So, do you know who those witches are? [gestures to nine banners] Those are the heads of the main nine covens. Each one excelled at a magic school like Glandus, St. Epiderm, and, of course, Hexside. Are you prepared to enter these hallowed halls?

Luz: Hmm, that's what I'm gonna figure out right now. [goes inside] See you on the other side, friends.

Gus: See you later, Luz. [summons letters spelling out "GOODBYE FOREVER!" Willow glares again.] You know what? I'm uh, I'ma just get rid of these.

[Cut to Principal Bump's office, where he's watching a crystal ball.]

Perry: [on the crystal ball] A terrible development at Glandus High School. Students and teachers were found unconscious and without magic. The cause remains unknown.

Principal Bump: Ha! Take that, Glandus! Looks like this year's Grudgby match is going to be a forfeit.

[door closes]

Luz: Hiya, Princy-B! Can I call you that?

Principal Bump: Absolutely not. Now, today we'll be visited by the Emperor's Coven for a routine inspection. If we want to impress them, you'll need to join a coven track before they arrive.

Luz: Actually, Principal Bump, I've made my own schedule. [unfurls a scroll] First, Vet Care for Mythical Beasts, then Healing and Dealing, and then after lunch-

Principal Bump: [laughs] Studying multiple tracks at once? No one does that.

Luz: Then I'll be the first.

Principal Bump: [very serious] No, you won't. [holds up rule book with Emperor's Coven logo on it] According to the rules, a good witch needs to hocus-focus. You can only pick one of the nine tracks. [points to the track banners above him] And you do not want to embarrass me in front of the inspector.

Luz: But all the tracks are so cool! Is there some sort of enchanted article of clothing that could sort this out for me?

Principal Bump: Well there used to be, but...

[Flashback to Principal Bump holding the Choosy Hat, a brown classic witch's hat, over a young student's head.]

Young Student: Oh, I'm so excited!

[The Choosy Hat is placed on their head. It turns around, a scarecrow-like face on the pointed part.]

Choosy Hat: And now... I feed! [brim grows teeth and closes around the student's head]

Young Student: Aaa!

[Cut back to the present.]

Principal Bump: [shudders]

Luz: I don't know if I can choose just one.

Principal Bump: Then I'll choose one for you. [points to the track banners] Eeny, meeny, miny, moe! Ah, yes! The Potions track. You humans are filled with liquids, right?

[Principal Bump casts a spell that changes the tunic and cowl of Luz's uniform to the standard greys and the sleeves and leggings to yellow.]

Luz: Oh, I guess I have always liked pouring things into other things.

Principal Bump: I expect you to be on your best behavior. [looks at a corkboard of with pictures of the results of Luz's previous visits to Hexside on it] Based on the costly repairs from recent incidents, we could really use a donation from the Emperor's Coven. Now, off to class.

[He floats Luz through the door.]

Random Student: *screams*

Principal Bump: The Choosy Hat! It broke free.

[Cut to Luz entering Potions 101.]

Potions Teacher: Welcome to a new semester! Let's get stirring! Today we'll make... [grabs potion] fog brews. [smashes bottle on the floor; pops up in front of their desk] Begin!

Luz: See, potions are fun! [pours test tube into cauldron] You could spend the rest of your life studying this, right?

[Something explodes outside. Luz looks out the window. Willow and Selene are facing off as wind blows. Selene grabs a crystal ball, out of which pops a mummy-like ghost.]

Luz: The Oracle Track!

[Willow traces a spell circle that she slams on the ground. A carnivorous flower grows out of the ground and hisses.]

Luz: The Plant Track!

[The ghost and the plant go at each other.]

Luz: [pawing at the window] Wow!

[Yellow smoke from Luz's cauldron has taken over most of the room.]

Potions Teacher: Ahem!

Luz: Sorry! [stirs her cauldron] Sorry.

[The Potions Teacher walks away.]

Luz: [shudders]

Bell: [inhales, rings smaller dinner bell]

[Everyone leaves class.]

Luz: [rotating her shoulder] Ooh boy! Stirring is the pits. What else is on the schedule for today?

[She pulls out a list reading: "Potions for Beginners, Potions in Motion, Potions (Again), Still Potions, Potions 'Till You Die, Potions After Death".]

Luz: Oh, man! I'm sorry, elbow!

[Luz looks up. Selene replaces the crystal ball she had used in the battle in a closet and walks away.]

Luz: A crystal ball. Maybe it can show me if I'm on the right track. No, don't be tempted! It's your first day. Make a good impression. [begins to walk away; pops up at the closet and grabs the ball] Whoa!

Spirit: [comes out of the ball] You will be in trouble very soon.

Luz: Wow! Wait, what'd you say?

Principal Bump: Ahem!

[Cut to Principal Bump dragging Luz through the halls.]

Luz: But I wasn't studying other subjects! I uh... fog brew! [tosses her potion on the ground, which doesn't work] Yeah. I figured that wouldn't work.

King: [climbs out of a trash can] Nyah.

Luz: King! Vouch for my character!

King: Uh, right! I don't know you!

[Luz glares at King as Principal Bump continues to drag her away. Cut to a classroom with bars on the door, which Principal Bump shoves Luz into. The Detention Teacher looks up from his scroll, and Viney, Jerbo, and Barcus look over at the door.]

Luz: What is this place?

Principal Bump: This is the place where all troublemakers go. [turns Luz's sleeves and leggings dark gray] The detention track.

Luz: [gasps] Nooooo! Detention track? But this can't be possible, I-I thought I--

Principal Bump: Yes. Actual detention still needs... repairs. In the meantime, I am keeping all troublemakers far away from the eyes of the inspector. You may try for a new track next year.

Luz: But I'll be back in the human world by then.

Principal Bump: Maybe you'll do better in human school.

[The door closes as Principal Bump leaves. Luz smiles awkwardly at everyone in the room, then sits at the desk.]

Luz: Hello, fellow detentioners. Room for one more? [looks around] I like the little spikeys in your hair.

Detention Teacher: Hey! You all better be quiet, unless you want to scrub the classroom again.

Luz: Hey, don't blame any of them. I'm the one that started talking.

Detention Teacher: Oh hurray. A hero.

[A mop and bucket appear in Luz's hands.]

Luz: [walks off] Aw, farts.

[Viney watches Luz walk off and smiles. Cut to King walking up to a trashcan.]

King: Time to scrounge through the trash- [yelps]

[He jumps in head first. Inside is an empty box of donuts with frosting rings. King licks the frosting.]

Teacher: That's it! I'm sick of someone eating all the donuts in the teacher's lounge. I quit!

[A tie is tossed onto King's head. He tries to take it off and knocks the trashcan over, rolling into a classroom while wearing the tie. The students all stare at him.]

Student #1: Are you our substitute?

King: Substitute? I ain't no desk jockey.

Student #2: Look at his professional looking tie! He must be!

King: Nyah! [hops onto desk] Can it, Fangs! You don't know diddly dang about squiddly squat!

Student #2: Uh, yes, sir! Sorry, sir! [bows]

King: Obedience? Well, what is a teacher if not an authority figure? A king of children, if you will. [runs to front of the room] Yes! I am your teacher! You may call me Mr. King!

[King looks at them all in annoyance and starts clapping. The class applauds. King beams. Cut to the detention room, where the Detention Teacher is asleep and Luz is polishing the bars on the windows. A teacher walks past the window outside with younger kids following her.]

Spider Teacher: Alright, kids. Who wants to go on a field trip to the astral planes?

Braxas: Yay!

Student #3: I do!

Luz: I do.

Willow: Luz!

Luz: Oh, my gosh! I missed you so much. Let me squeeze your faces. [squeezes Willow's face]

Gus: What's going on? We didn't see you in any classes.

Luz: Principal Bump put me in the detention track for mixing magic.

Willow: The detention track? You can't do anything in there.

Gus: You'll learn less than you did before.

Luz: No, I'm better than this. Please, you gotta help me break out.

Gus: Don't worry. We'll get you out, dead or alive!

Willow: [glances at Gus, shakes her head]

Gus: Okay. Alive.

Luz: Aw, you guys.

[chair squeaks]

Luz: It's the teacher. Gotta go!

[She turns around and sees Viney very close to her.]

Luz: [gasps] It's you!

Viney: Shh.

[Viney points to the snoring Detention Teacher, then gestures for Luz to follow her. Viney draws a square on the chalkboard with a keyhole in the center, then turns the chalk in the hole like a key. The square glows and swings open, revealing a passageway. ]

Luz: Whoa.

[Viney climbs through the hole, then helps Luz through. The square closes behind her.]

Luz: What is this place?

Viney: This is the last room you'll ever see alive. [pauses] Nah, just messing with ya. I'm Viney.

Luz: I'm terrified! Um, I mean... I'm Luz.

Viney: Thanks for standing up for us back there. Not many people would do that. Follow me! I wanna show you something. You're one of us troublemakers now, so you'll get special access to the Secret Room of Shortcuts!

[Viney opens a door, revealing a tower-like room with a spiraling ramp. The walls, floor, and ceiling are covered in doors and windows.]

Luz: Whoa.

Viney: Hey Jerbo! Barcus! You can stop hiding now!

Jerbo: [opens a door] How do we know she's cool, man? How do we know she won't turn us in? [to Barcus] What do you think?

Barcus: [barks]

Jerbo: Barcus says your aura is strong and silly, like a baby's laughter. Welcome!

Luz: Aah! I love secret rooms! Where do the doors go?

[Luz opens one into a hallway where Amity is pacing.]

Amity: [to herself] So, you two go to the same school now, that doesn't change anything. [sighs]

[Luz shuts the door.]

Amity: Huh?

Viney: This place connects the different parts of the school. We found it after being thrown in the detention track. The witch who made it is known as... [gestures to a defaced portrait and wall of signatures] Lord Calamity.

Jerbo: They started this troublemaker wall and we added our names in their honor.

Luz: This place is amazing. I bet you guys can get into so much trouble in here.

Viney: [chuckles] Sure, we can, but we can also do so much more.

[She points to where Barcus is listening in on an Oracle class. Luz walks up and watches with him.]

Oracle Teacher: Remember, seeing the end of a life is the beginning of reading a fortune. We have to work backwards from it to see the truth.

[The teacher folds a fortune teller. Barcus also folds one.]

Viney: We aren't allowed to study any kind of magic, so we study every kind of magic in secret.

Luz: You actually like school?

Viney: Yeah, we might have liked it too much.

[Cut to Jerbo wearing a Plant track uniform in a classroom with Principal Bump.]

Jerbo: [voiceover] I tried mixing plant magic with abominations.

[An earthy abomination grows out from under the flower Jerbo grew. The abomination throws a flower pot.]

Jerbo: [voiceover] Bump was not thrilled.

[Principal Bump gets hit in the face with a wad of dirt. Cut to Barcus (wearing a Potions track uniform), the Potions Teacher, and Principal Bump in a Potions classroom.]

Jerbo: [voiceover] Barcus makes potions with oracle magic.

[Barcus mixes a potion, then dumps a crystal ball into it. The Potions Teacher looks into the cauldron and sees themself rapidly age. They scream and fall backwards, flipping a large cauldron over themself. Principal Bump shakes his head at Barcus. Cut to a Healing classroom, where Viney, wearing a Healing track uniform, is looking at a scratch on a Bard student's arm as Principal Bump enters the room.]

Viney: [voiceover] Mixing healing and beast keeping was slightly unconventional.

[Viney heals the Bard's arm, then draws another spell circle. A young griffin bursts through the chalkboard.]

Viney: [voiceover] But Puddles was a great assistant, dang it!

[Puddles coughs up lollipops and Viney notices Bump glaring at her. Cut back to the Secret Room of Shortcuts.]

Viney: We all want to be in more than one coven track! But Bump just says we need to focus.

Luz: Sounds like Bump's priorities are out of whack.

Viney: I'm glad you're one of us. You've made a great first impression. [pulls out a marker] Would you like to add your name to the troublemaker wall?

Luz: Aw! [reaches for the marker]

Willow: [through the wall] Luz? We're here to get you out of that horrible class.

[Everyone looks at Luz.]

Luz: Eh, they're probably looking for some other Luz.

[Viney stands and peeks through the main entrance. Willow and Gus are looking around the detention classroom.]

Gus: Maybe she already booked it.

Willow: [whistles like she's calling a dog]

Gus: She did say she was better than this place.

Viney: [closes door] Oh. You think you're better than us?

Luz: No, no, it's not like that. I just didn't think I deserved-- I mean, none of us deserve--

Jerbo: Jacques! I should've known you'd look down on us. Everyone else does.

Barcus: [sneezes, captions reading: You have an aura of lies.]

Viney: It's fine, I just... I thought someone finally understood us. But, maybe you should just leave. [points to the door]

Barcus: [gasps]

Luz: I understand.

[Cut back to the classroom, where Gus plays with the Detention Teacher's mustache.]

Gus: Man, this guy can sleep through anything. [grabs mop] I'm gonna test that theory.

Willow: No. We have to find Luz. If only these walls could talk.

[Luz pushes the wall door open.]

Luz: Hey, guys. [slumps onto the floor face first]

Willow: Thank you, walls! [helps Luz stand] We found a way to get you out to talk to Principal Bump.

Gus: We have an expert disguise! [grabs a trashcan] Hop in! It's got holes for your gangly teenage legs.

[Luz looks at the wall as Viney closes the door.]

Luz: Yeah. That's right where I belong.

Gus: And this way the inspector won't see you either.

[Luz climbs into the trashcan. Gus puts the lid on Luz's head. She stands and walks off. Willow and Gus follow her. Camera pans to the still-snoring Detention Teacher. Gus pops up next to him and puts the mop on his face. He continues snoring.]

Gus: Incredible.

[Cut to outside, where a swirl of blue energy appears. It dissipates, revealing the inspector. She walks up the front steps.]

Principal Bump: Welcome to Hexside, inspector.

Inspector: Greetings, Principal Bump. [bows] If everything's in order, the Emperor's Coven will be happy to cover your repairs.

Principal Bump: Excellent. Please come this way. We've prepared a show with some of our finest students.

[Cut to an abomination stomping on stage. It growls and holds Amity up like an figure skater. They pose. The abomination puts Amity down.]

Amity: And that concludes the presentation from the Abomination track.

[Amity and her abomination bow.]

Principal Bump: [politely applauds] That was some real Hexside magic, huh?

Inspector: Yes, this is... good! But let's see if your student can put up more of a fight! [stands]

Principal Bump: Yes, yes-- wait what?

[The inspector slams her hands down on the stage. Her face deforms, revealing that she is in fact a greater basilisk.]

Principal Bump: Is, uh, this part of the inspection?

Amity: Abomination, fight!

[Amity's abomination runs forward and grabs the inspector. The inspector fully transforms into a basilisk and flings the abomination into the air. It growls and swallows the abomination. It slithers toward Amity, who backs away.]

Inspector: The magic at Glandus High was tasty. But I hope yours will be more filling.

Principal Bump: [running between Amity and the inspector] Amity, stay back. She's an impostor!

[Principal Bump draws out a spell circle. The inspector inhales, swallowing the spell circle and draining his magic. His skin turns gray and he collapses. Amity tries to cast a spell, but her magic is also drained, and she falls unconscious next to Principal Bump.]

[Cut to King's classroom, where he is writing on the chalkboard.]

King: Assume a coefficient of ten, carry the two, solve for Y, and that is the way to steal a pie from a windowsill! [he has drawn himself stealing pie on the chalkboard] Also you can eat trash.

Student #1: Finally, some skills we can really use.

King: [pulls out a slice of pizza] And now, for my next lesson--

[loud growl]

King: Seriously? It's not even fifth period yet.

[Cut to King opening the doors of the auditorium.]

King: Excuse me! Could you keep it down? Mr. King's trying to mold young minds here!

[The inspector is sucking more life out of Principal Bump.]

Principal Bump: Ugh. Only 300 years until retirement.

[The inspector looks at King.]

King: I can see that I'm interrupting, so I'm just gonna... [screams and runs away]

[Cut to a hallway, where Luz is no longer in a trashcan.]

Luz: [sighs]

Willow: Don't worry, Luz! Once we talk to Bump, we'll get everything sorted out.

Luz: I know, but what's the point if people get hurt on the way?

Gus: That is a fair question. Here's another question. What the heck is that?! [points]

[The Oracle Teacher is running away from the inspector, which is taking over most of a hallway. The teacher stops and casts a beam of light. The inspector slurps the beam of light up like spaghetti. The teacher falls, drained of magic.]

Willow, Luz, & Gus: [scream]

Inspector: [laughs] More cute morsels!

Willow: We may be cute, but we're nobody's morsels! [summons carnivorous plant]

Gus: Time for a power-up!

[Gus gives the plant buff arms. The plant launches itself at the inspector. It catches the plant with its tail and eats it. Willow and Gus both fall, drained of magic.]

Willow: [tries to draw another spell circle] I feel... so weak.

Luz: [runs in front of her friends] Eat this!

[She grabs her notepad and activates a light glyph on it, then throws it in the inspector's mouth. The spell activates, and the inspector screams, spewing out shredded paper.]

Luz: [picks up Willow and Gus] I'll get you guys somewhere safe!

Inspector: It burns! It burns!

Luz: [bursts into the Secret Room of Shortcuts] Guys! I need your help!

Viney: Oh. You're back.

Luz: I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, but please listen! [falls, drops Willow] Argh! Willow...

Viney, Jerbo, & Barcus: [gasp]

Viney: What happened to them?

Luz: Something horrible is loose in the school.

[Luz opens a door to show the inspector draining more students' magic.]

Viney: Don't let it see us! [closes the door] I think that's a greater basilisk. I heard about them in a class. My cousin at St. Epiderm said she saw one, but those things should be extinct.

Luz: It must've attacked the other schools, and now it's come for us. We have to do something.

Jerbo: But if Bump catches us mixing magic again--

Viney: He'd kick us outta school.

Luz: Hexoleos are out there gettin' hurt, and we're the only ones who can save them. We're troublemakers, right? So let's go out there and make some trouble.

[Viney, Jerbo, and Barcus share a look. Cut to a hallway, where the inspector drains Amelia of her magic.]

Inspector: Hungry! Still hungry!

[An ice glyph is thrown in front of the inspector. It activates, summoning a pillar of ice that throws the inspector back. Luz hops in front of it wearing a cloak.]

Luz: From humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise. I've trained with a secret society to discover the power of mixing magic! I am-

Inspector: Dinner!

Luz: Wah!

[Luz ditches the cloak and runs. The inspector slams into the pillar of ice. It rights itself and chases after Luz.]

Luz: Viney! Do the thing, do the thing!

[Puddles flies through the halls and attacks the inspector.]

Viney: Attagirl, Puddles! Jerbo, now!

Jerbo: On it!

[An abomination opens a door in the floor as Jerbo summons several thorny vines. The vines latch onto a door handle in the ceiling. The inspector claws at Puddles and throws her, then falls through the opened door. Luz hops in after it, sending it through the door in the floor of the Secret Room of Shortcuts. Cut to the auditorium, where Principal Bump sits up.]

Principal Bump: Must find help.

[The inspector falls onto the stage.]

Luz: Wooh!

[Luz falls through the ceiling after the inspector, landing on its stomach and flipping off of it to land on the stage.]

Luz: It's all you, Barcus!

Barcus: [barks, grabs the inspector's palm]

Inspector: Where am I?

[Barcus dumps a potion onto the inspector's hand. He squints at it, then his eyes glow.]

Barcus: [yips]

Inspector: What's he doing? What'd he say?

Luz: He's reading your palm, and your future looks bleak.

[Jerbo's abomination pulls at a rope that Puddles cuts with her beak. The rope drops sandbags onto the inspector's stomach. All of the magic it ate is released and returned to the proper witch. Everyone gasps as they get their magic back and wake up. Magic flies through the air as it returns to other schools. Back in the auditorium, Viney heals Puddles's scratched claw.]

Puddles: [warbles, flies off]

Luz: AH! [hugs Viney] You did it! You were amazing! You guys--

Principal Bump: Are in so much trouble. Leaving your homeroom, mixing magic and-- is that a secret hideout?

[Willow and Gus duck away from the open trap door.]

Luz: Yeah it is. But let's think about this, Principal Bump. Why would kids in the detention track need a secret hideout?

Principal Bump: I don't care to know the ins and outs of rascality. [pulls out rule book] But if the Emperor's Coven can send an actual inspector this time--

Luz: Okay, you need coven money. But if you have to hurt your students to get it, what's the point? They saved Hexside. They should be allowed to study what they wish.

Principal Bump: B-but-- [hugs rule book]

Gus: Do the right thing, ya dingus.

Principal Bump: Alright, I'm smart enough to know when I've made a mistake. Which tracks would you like to be in?

All: [gasp]

Viney: Healing and Beast Keeping!

Jerbo: Plants and Abomination!

Barcus: [barks]

Principal Bump: Then so be it. [changes their uniforms to reflect their new tracks] But if any of you cause more property damage, I'm feeding you to the choosy hat. [to Luz] And you?

Luz: Oh, I still can't choose. Maybe it's crazy but I wish I could study a little bit of everything. Whoa.

[Luz gets a full magical-girl transformation sequence as her uniform takes several colors to reflect the different tracks.]

Luz: What's going on? What is this? Whoa-ho! This is so cool. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna study everything!

Principal Bump: You know, only one other student wanted to study every track. [summons Lord Calamity's picture] Unfortunately, she was never given the opportunity.

[With a wipe of his hand, the graffiti on the picture disappears, revealing a young Eda.]

Luz: [gasps, chuckles] I shoulda guessed.

[Cut to Eda arriving at Hexside on her staff. Cut to Principal Bump walking through the halls, writing in the rule book.]

Principal Bump: The coven denies knowing about the basilisk, but that won't stop me from writing a very stern letter.

King: Alright. Read chapters three to five on the right way to scratch yourself in public. Spoiler alert: There's no wrong way! [sighs] Days like these make being a teacher all worth it.

Principal Bump: You're not a teacher.

King: Weh?

[Principal Bump is staring at King disapprovingly.]

King: Maybe not, but I care about these kids, [tosses coffee in Principal Bump's face] and nothing can change that.

[Cut to the front entrance, which bursts open. Principal Bump waves a broom at King as the demon flees, squealing.]
Luz: [voiceover] And here we have the most fearsome creature in the world, the King of Demons.

[The video zooms out to show King trying to tear a sock off his nose.]

Luz: Facing his natural enemy, the ducky sock!

King: [grunting, tears the sock into pieces, then punches the remnants] Where are you now, ducky sock?

Luz: So, why'd you call me here again?

King: Oh, yeah. [grunting, climbs up a table] Human Luz, you've been so obsessed with witchcraft that you haven't learned anything about my kind. Prepare yourself for... [rips off a curtain to reveal a corkboard of photos of various demons; puts on a hat and spins the cord on top of it] Demons 101. Demons like me are grim tricksters of the twilight, creatures of sulfur and bone.

Luz: [zooming in with her camera] And cute little paws.

King: [sighs] And cute little paws. True. We live only to create chaos and misery. Our only weaknesses are purified water and passive-aggressive comments. Sometimes.

Luz: Oh, you guys are sensitive.

King: Even demons have inner demons. [tears off one of the pictures to reveal a snarling demon] The most powerful demon of all is the Snaggleback. He's a--

Luz: Bad boy!

[A colored filter appears over the screen, followed by several stickers. Luz aims her phone down and taps on her screen.]

King: Luz, pay attention. This information could save your life someday.

Luz: No, no. I am so paying attention. This is my paying attention face. [nodding] Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[Lightning crashes, immediately followed by a thunder rumble. Luz and King look outside.]

King: Uh-oh. Looks like it's gonna rain.

Luz: [gasps] I love the rain.

King: Hey, wait.

Luz: [opens the door, exhales] I always love feeling the first few drops in my hair. [kneels down to talk to a flower] I bet you do too, little buddy.

[A water drop drops down to the flower, making it wither and die immediately.]

Luz: What?

Eda: [runs to the house] Boiling rain! Everybody inside now!

Luz: Huh? [yelps]

[Eda grabs her arm and drags the both of them inside. Objects crash and clatter.]

Eda: Phew! That was close. But the important thing is you didn't get hurt.

Luz: [lying painfully] Yep. [groans as a cup falls on her head] Not hurt.

[THEME]

[Cut to Boonesborough, where residents are screaming and running from the boiling rain. Buildings attached to the side of a cliff fall off. Cut to Willow's house, where she takes plants off of a balcony.]

Willow: Ow, ow, ow, ow.

[She drags a curtain closed with her teeth. Cut to an alleyway, where Tiny Nose is running.]

Tiny Nose: [shrieking]

[She ducks into a crack in a wall, which she tosses a rat out of.]

Tiny Nose: [hisses]

[Cut to the outside of the Owl House, where King is putting a bandage on a burn on Luz's arm. He puts another bandage on his snout.]

King: Look, now we're boo-boo buddies.

Luz: [squeals, then falls over] Oh, my gosh, I love you so much. [looks at Eda, who is creating a spell under a force field] A boiling rainstorm on the Boiling Isles. The weather here is so fun.

Eda: Yeah, we don't have weather. We have plagues, gorenados, shale hail, painbows.

King: It's like a rainbow but looking at it turns you inside out.

[Luz pulls the drawstrings of her hoodie closed.]

Eda: So, until the boiling rain stops, no one is allowed outside tonight.

King: And if the rain doesn't get you, the Snaggleback will. [opens a book, showing Snaggleback images] They wander the rain, feeding on boiled tourists.

Eda: Well, whatever the case, this force field spell should protect the house from boiling rains and made-up demons.

Hooty: Hoot! Well, hurry it up with that force field. That rain is getting closer to my precious stucco.

Eda: Yeah, yeah, I got it.

[She uses her staff to grab the light ball and stamps the staff down to the ground. A round orange force field engulfs the house, then shrinks to shape closely around it. Eda begins walking toward the house.]

Luz: Wow! Someday I'd like to be as cool as Eda the Owl Lady. Magical, sassy, surprisingly foxy for her age. Hey, why do they call you the Owl Lady, anyway?

Eda: 'Cause I'm so wise.

Hooty: 'Cause she coughs up rat bones.

King: I think it's 'cause she gets distracted by shiny objects.

Eda: No, I don't.

[King takes out a pen. He clicks it, and the diamond on top of it glows.]

Eda: [delightedly] It sparkles and shimmers. It shines and delights. I must have it for my nest...

[She lunges for the pen, but King puts it behind his back and she crashes on the ground.]

Eda: [groans]

Luz: You have a nest? I want a nest! Nest party! [She helps Eda up.]

Eda: [tiredly] Ugh. That force field really took it out of me.

King: Uh-oh. Moving a little slow. Age finally catching up to ya? [screams as Eda hoods his head with the hat] Darkness!

Luz: [watching Eda enter the house] This is perfect. Since we'll be stuck in the house all night, Eda won't have any excuse not to teach me a spell. [follows Eda]

King: But don't you wanna finish our lesson? I was gonna let you scratch a demon's tummy. Me!

Luz: Oh, uh, sorry, King. But... magic.

[King is visibly frustrated. His horn pierces his hat, making it deflate. Cut to Eda walking behind a privacy screen. She snaps her fingers, causing a glow of light as she drops her staff. When she emerges from the other side, she's in her pajamas. She sighs as she lies down on the couch. Luz's shadow falls over her.]

Eda: Ahh!

Luz: Oh, Eda, have I told you how rad your fang looks today?

Eda: Whatever it is, no.

Luz: Uh, and your hair is like... girl.

Eda: I'm not teaching you magic tonight. I'm sleepy. [covers her body with blanket] I'm a sleepy little owl.

Luz: Please, Eda, please. How am I supposed to earn my witch's staff if I don't know any spells?

Eda: No. Sleep. [She covers her whole head with the blanket. Something clicks.]

Eda: [gasps] Sparkle thing.

[Eda sits up, still wrapped in the blanket, and watches as Luz clicks the pen several times.]

Luz: Oh, this?

[Eda tosses aside the blanket in favor of perching on the arm of the couch.]

Eda: Ooh!

[Luz moves the pen tauntingly. Eda swipes for it.]

Luz: Nope. [Eda falls down.] Teach me one spell, and I'll give you your sparkle thing.

Eda: I respect your cunning, but I also hate you for it.

[Flash of lightning with clap of thunder. Cut to Eda standing in front of Luz.]

Eda: If you want a witch's staff like mine, don't make me repeat myself. [gasps as she wakes herself up] Witch's staffs have power embedded into them.

Luz: Gimme!

Eda: But before one is earned, every witch needs to know how to cast spells on their own. Now... [throws staff to the side] tonight I will show you how to create... light.

[Draws a circle with her finger in the air, which glows orange. White light sparks in the center, forming a large ball of light. It descends until it's in front of Luz's face, where it disappears.]

Luz: [gasps]

King: Yawn! Who needs another boring spell lesson when you could be learning all the fun ways a demon could kill you. [holds up a drawing of a demon with giant teeth] Look how teethy. Bite, bite.

Luz: Be quiet. I need to focus.

Eda: Now, humans think magic is made out of thin air, but that's stupid. Everything comes from something. Let me ask you, kid. Where do you think magic comes from?

Luz: Uh, from the heart?

Eda: Actually, you're right.

Luz: [gasps in joy, blushes]

Eda: No, really. [pulls out a diagram of viscera from her hair and shows it to Luz] It comes from a sac of magic bile attached to a witch's heart.

Luz: Oh, gross. Can I keep that?

Eda: No. [shoves the diagram back in her hair] Now, everything depends on the spell circle. [draws a large circle in the air] The bigger the circle, the more powerful the spell.

[The circle bursts out, creating a much bigger light than before. It fades much faster.]

Luz: But how can I, little ol' Luz, do spells if I don't have a magic bile... sac?

Eda: You know, I'm not actually sure.

Luz: What?

Eda: I know witches did magic differently in the past, but I never bothered to figure out how. [laughs, snorts]

Luz: Eda!

Eda: Don't worry. You'll figure it out. Now-- [stands and cracks her back] I need to lie down.

Luz: That's it? Wait! I need to see you do the circle thingy again. I'll record it on my phone this time.

[Cut to Luz recording Eda.]

Luz: Smile! You're on camera. One more spell won't kill you.

Eda: [groans] Fine. Now, you see, the... [draws a shaky circle] spell circle is really key because-- [the circle disappears as she yawns] Ooh, boy. [falls]

King: Welp, looks like one more spell killed Eda.

Luz: [yelps]

[Eda is rolled over on the floor.]

Luz: Oh, my gosh. My obsession with spells knocked out Eda. I'm a monster.

King: Bap! [slaps Eda's face] Yep. She's out. Bap! [slaps Eda's face, laughs] Just making sure.

Luz: We should get help, right?

[She runs to the door but is stopped by King grabbing her leg.]

King: Boiling rains, remember?

Hooty: No, let her try. It'll be funny.

[King slams the door.]

Luz: But what if Eda's dead?

Eda: [sleep talking] Shiny thing. Big nest. [snoring]

King: Remember when her head got cut off last week? That woman can survive anything. She's probably just tired from staying up all night chasing shrews and voles.

Luz: Well, we can't just leave her on the floor.

[King tiredly looks at Eda. A thunderclap later, him and Luz are dragging Eda into her room by her feet. Luz tosses a small animal skull out of Eda's giant nest before puling her into it. Eda continues snoring.]

Luz: Sorry for pushing you, Miss Eda. Please don't hurt me when you wake up.

King: Should I bap her again?

Luz: [rubs King's head] Just let her rest, you little goober. Come on. Let's go downstairs.

King: [smacks Eda again] Bap! [cackles as he runs off]

[Cut to the living room, where King is redrawing a demon with several mouths. When he finishes, he holds up his notepad.]

King: Yeah, yeah.

Luz: [groans, trying to draw a spell circle] This is all she does. Why you gotta be so cryptic, Owl Lady? [hits play on the video]

Eda: [on the video] Now, you see, the spell circle is really...

King: [puts his notepad over Luz's phone] Hey, you know what's really cryptish? Let me tell you about the most spine-chilling demon. [lifts up notepad to show a fish-like demon] Smoochy-pie the Sweetie Baby! He's... Well, he's a lot more threatening than his name implies.

Luz: Not now, King. I want to figure out this spell. But if I don't have a magic sac, what's the point? I'll just be twirling my fingers around un-magically forever.

King: Why do you want to learn magic so bad, anyway?

Luz: I was a nobody back home. [sits down] But becoming a witch is my chance to be someone. Do you know what it's like to have no one take you seriously?

King: [sighs]

[thunder distantly rumbles]

King: If I help you learn that spell, could we finish our lesson?

Luz: [puts her phone away] Oh, yes, yes. You can teach me about demons all week if you help me learn this spell.

King: Well, she said witches used to do magic differently, so there has to be a way, right? [draws something and shows it to Luz] And I have a theory. Every day I notice Eda sneaking drinks of this special elixir, see? Then she always gets a boost of energy, see? I think that's where she gets her powers. And I know where to get some.

Luz: Really?

King: Sí.

[Luz pulls him into a hug.]

Luz: Thank you so much. You're a prince.

King: King. I'm King.

Luz: Right.

[Cut to Eda's room, where flashes of lightning go off outside her window. Eda is snoring in her nest. The door squeaks open, and King steps in and looks around.]

King: Now where could it be...

[He notices a bright orange potion on Eda's side table. He starts sneaking over to it, stopping at a metal clang.]

King: [gasps] Ha! Nice try.

Trap: Nah, my heart wasn't in it. [leaves]

[King continues on, scampering up a curtain to reach the tabletop. He reads the tag attached to the potion.]

King: "An elixir a day." Cryptic. [rips off the tag] Nyeh.

[He tucks the tag under his collar, then takes the potion and hops to the floor. He looks between Eda and the potion guiltily, making nervous noises.]

King: Nah.

[He leaves. Cut to the kitchen, where Luz is waiting eagerly and wearing an apron.]

King: Got it!

Luz: [takes the potion and opens it] Wow. I can't believe I'm about to learn magic. Real magic. This is historic.

[She slowly lifts the potion to her mouth. A clap of thunder startles her, and she fumbles the potion until it smashes on the floor.]

Luz: Golden elixir. Gone! This is awful.

King: Who even needs a light spell when we have tons of lamps?

[The lamps flare and die. Luz glares at King.]

King: [groans] Hooty controls the house lights. He probably just fell asleep.

[crash]

Hooty: Hoot! Hoot!

Luz: Hooty! [takes off the apron and runs]

Hooty: Hoot, oh, hoot!

[Luz and King reach the living room and gasp. A shadowy beast has knocked the door of its hinges and made a mess of the front wall. It leaves deep scratches in the wood next to Hooty, growls when it notices the other two, then flees. Luz and King run up to Hooty.]

Luz: Hooty! Are you in there? [taps his beak a few times and checks his eye] Whatever did this escaped into the rain. What could survive that?

King: Oh, my gosh. The Snaggleback! It feeds during the rains. It must have stumbled across our house and seen us inside.

[Something howls. They go outside in time for the shadowy creature to jump through an upper floor window.]

Luz: This is terrifying. So why do you look so happy?

King: [squealing] Because this could be a lesson. This would be a great way for you to see a wild demon up close and personal.

Luz: You want to go toward those creepy sounds? No way!

King: What if Eda gets eaten? She's upstairs and defenseless because you knocked her out.

Luz: [groans]

[Cut to the two preparing for battle. Luz pulls on rubber gloves. King tapes a pillow to his chest. Luz puts bandages under her eyes like eye black, then grins. Luz grabs a hockey stick, which King runs past in favor of grabbing Francois.]

King: Weh!

[Cut to the two approaching the staircase, Luz using the flashlight on her phone to light the way. Floorboards creak as they go upstairs. They reach a hallway and stop as the door to Eda's room creaks open. They share a nervous look. Luz opens the doors all the way, revealing an empty room and a shattered window, through which we can again see a lightning strike.]

Luz: Oh, my gosh. Eda! [runs to Eda's nest]

King: She got snaggle-backed.

Luz: Eda? [holds up a damaged pillow] No! Slash marks. King! You're the demon expert. I need your help.

King: I'll go get my demon book.

[He runs out of the room and down the hall. A shadow snarls as it passes over him. He returns holding two books.]

King: Wait, wait. First edition or second? [gasps] Luz? [drops the books] The Snaggleback got her.

[The shadow snarls again as it passes behind him. He chases after it.]

King: You craven beast. Give me back my boo-boo buddy.

[He rounds a corner and gasps. A door creaks closed, Luz's shoe upside down in front of it.]

King: Luz?

[He picks up the shoe. Holding it like a weapon, he opens the door and enters the closet. He looks around until noticing a shadow hiding behind clothes.]

King: There's nowhere for you to run! [moves the clothes aside] Snaggleback? Wow. You are a lot shorter in person.

Snaggleback: [stammering] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I-I just needed a place to hide from the rains.

King: Then why did you break down our door and take Luz? That's not cool, man. Bad Snaggleback!

Snaggleback: I- I didn't do any of that stuff. I snuck in through a window just now.

King: Huh? Well, then what...

[crashing]

Snaggleback: Oh, no! A twist!

[A shadowed claw pulls Snaggleback through the ceiling. Snarls and stomps can be heard as King backs away from the hole. Something bangs against the door.]

King: [yells, then whimpers]

[The door creaks open, revealing the shadowy beast, still snarling. It spits out Snaggleback's shell, then roars.]

King: Oh, my.

[The beast advances, forcing King against the wall.]

King: [yelps] Stay back. Hey, hey. I am the king of demons, okay? And as such, I demand you to barf my friends back up.

[The beast screeches and raises a claw. King yells and ducks, and the claws score the wall where his head was a moment before, King runs.]

[King is far more nimble than the beast, rounding corners with ease while the beast slams into the walls. King is yelping and the beast is snarling. When King rounds a second corner, Luz's arm reaches out and pulls him into a room. The door closes with a squeak. The beast enters the hallway slowly, exhaling loudly. Cut to inside Eda's room, where Luz is holding King. Footsteps are heard outside as a shadow passes the door.]

King: Luz?

Luz: King! Oh, I'm so glad you're safe. [puts King down]

King: Where did you go?

Luz: I was checking on Eda, and she was gone, and then you were gone. I also tripped and lost my shoe. Oh, hey, you found it. [takes it]

King: I--

[Luz raises her foot to put her shoe on, revealing a piece of paper on the bottom of her foot.]

King: What's that? [takes it and reads it] "Keeps the curse at bay." [gasps, pulls out the tag in his collar and puts them together] "An elixir a day, keeps the curse at bay."

Luz: Curse? Wait, what are you trying to say?

King: I was wrong the whole time. That's no Snaggleback. That creature is...

[They both scream as a clawed hand bursts through the door. A body follows it, and it growls and turns to reveal a familiar face.]

Luz: Eda?

[Eda snarls and stalks closer, raising a claw to swipe at them. Luz screams and braces. Her phone falls out of her pocket, and the camera goes off when it hits the floor. The flash blinds Eda, making her scream. Luz takes the distraction to grab King and hide on a balcony. Eda screams, and it echoes loudly.]

[Eda stalks the room, sniffing. Luz has her hands over her mouth while King has his on his head. Eda seems to smell them, growling and sniffing closer to them. Luz grabs a can and throws it. Eda growls at the sound and chases it.]

Luz: Oh, man. Did you see her eyes? They were like-- [snarls] What happened to her?

King: Don't you see? The elixir I gave you doesn't give Eda powers. It prevents her from turning into that thing. She's turned into a nightmare and it's all my fault. I'm so sorry, Luz. I-I just wanted you to be into demons like you're into magic. I don't have many friends, and no one even pays that much attention to me. I thought maybe if I taught you, finally someone would care about creatures like me.

Luz: Well... [holds out the pen] let's finish the lesson.

King: Huh?

Luz: Eda's turned into some kind of demon, and we need to save her. So who knows more about demons than the best teacher in the world?

[King brightens and points to himself. Luz nods. He takes the pen, then giggles and hugs Luz. He smacks some leaves onto the floor.]

King: Let's see. [draws on the leaves] She was bigger, covered in feathers, and had giant black eyes. Demons with black eyes are usually sensitive to light. [looks at Luz's phone] That's it. Light! Luz, use your human wonder rectangle.

Luz: I can't. My camera's all blasted.

King: Then... what about that light spell?

Luz: [sighs] You saw me. I can't draw circles in the air. I'm not like Eda. [plays the video]

Eda: [on video] ...spell circle is really key...

[The video glitches.]

Luz: [gasps] There's a pattern in the spell circle.

King: [looks at Luz's phone] What? Where?

Luz: [grabs a leaf and the pen] It looks like this. [draws over the pattern] There.

[She taps the pattern with the tip of the pen. The drawing on the leaf begins glowing.]

Luz: [gasps]

[The leaf folds into itself, brightening until it's a small floating ball of light. Luz gently cups it in her hands, bringing it to eye level.]

Luz: It's beautiful.

[Thunder rumbles and rain hisses as it hits the shield.]

Luz: Oh, my gosh. I just did magic. [stands triumphantly] I just did magic! I just did magic!

King: Shh! We're not going to stop anything with something that small.

[Distant screeching makes both of them cower.]

King: What do we do now?

Luz: I think I know how to get Eda back. Will you help me, boo-boo buddy? [offers a fist bump]

King: [hums] I'm kind of over that nickname. But okay. [fist bumps her]

[Cut to the living room, where Beast Eda is sniffing around. She pounces onto the treasure chest next to the fallen door, sniffing a book. A clicking sound distracts her.]

King: [holding the pen] Oh, what lovely thing do we have here? It's just so dang shiny. Oh, my. Oh, dear.

[Eda stares at the pen's light, cooing. She screeches and lunges for it. King runs and Eda follows. King ducks down a hallway. Eda slides on a pile of books and papers. She crashes into a wall, and gasps when Luz tosses a blanket over her head.]

Luz: I'm sorry, Eda. But it's for your own good.

[She finishes drawing a giant light glyph on the wall. With a grunt, she slams it to activate it. Blinding light is produced.]

Eda: [screams]

[Cut to Eda, back in witch form, laying in her nest with a straw in her mouth. She sits up, still partially transformed.]

Eda: Ahh! [slurps and returns to normal] W-What happened? Oh, I have the worst headache. And my mouth tastes like roadkill. [gags, retches]

[A giant owl pellet breaks, revealing Snaggleback.]

Snaggleback: I'm just gonna... lie here for a minute.

Eda: [grabs the potion] Hmm? I was looking for that.

King: [walking over] Actually, we found an extra one in your closet.

Eda: King? King! You stole my elixir? I ought to break every bone in your--

King: Shh! [whispering] Over there.

[Luz is surrounded by balls of light. She draws out another glyph as thunder rumbles in the background. She activates the glyph, grinning as the ball of light joins the others.]

Eda: Wow. How is she doing that?

[Camera pans up to show dozens of balls of light.]

King: I don't know, but she did it all on her own. Hey, I, uh, kind of messed a bunch of things up back there. And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

Eda: Well, you better be. I got a long list of disgusting chores with your name on it. But it's not entirely your fault. [Luz walks over] I haven't been completely honest with you guys. When I was younger, I was cursed. I don't know exactly how it happened, all I know is that if I don't take my elixir... Well, that's why people call me the Owl Lady. No one likes having a curse, but if you take the right steps, it's manageable.

Luz: Whoa. So are you okay?

Eda: There's nothing for you to worry about. It's all under control, and as long as no one steals my elixir -- King -- then I'm fine. But, hey, look at this. A human doing magic. Good on you, kid.

Luz: I had some encouragement from a great teacher.

King: Oh, you.

Hooty: Hey, hey! Is anyone there? Hello? Hoot? I'm on the floor. It's cold!

King: That voice. That horrific voice!

Luz: We'll take care of him. You stay in bed. [picks up Snaggleback] Come on, you goopy fella. We'll set you free now.

Snaggleback: Ow, ow, ow. I think my tail was digested.

[door closes]

Eda: [sighs and lays back down]

[Eda closes her eyes. The scene changes to a void, with only Eda and a door. Indistinct whispering can be heard.]

Eda: No, not this memory again.

[The door opens. On the other side is a wavering shadow, two circles of light near the top, back-lit by pure white light.]

Eda: You! You're the one who cursed me, aren't you? Who are you? Who are you?

[Fade back to Eda's room as she sits up in her nest with a gasp. She looks around and exhales. Cut to the living room, where the door and Hooty have been restored to their rightful place. Luz has put bandages on the claw marks on the door.]

Luz: Welcome to the boo-boo buddy club, Hooty.

Hooty: Finally, I get to be a part of something.

[Camera pans to the couch, where Snaggleback and King are sitting, the latter drawing.]

Snaggleback: And then she had teeth in her stomach. Teeth in her stomach! Can you believe that?

King: Oh, yeah. [shows his drawing] This will make a great addition to my demon book.

Snaggleback: That book is filled with so many interesting things. [grabs the book] Like this. I'm one of the strongest demons on the Boiling Isles, huh?

King: Yeah, I'm gonna have to edit that.

Snaggleback: Oh.

Boscha: [sporting tentacles] Too wiggly. [changes to miniature flames] Too obvious. [stops on talons] Now we're talkin'! I think today is a talons day - rawr!

Skara: Hey girls! Time to bug out at my birthday party!

[Skara holds up an invite which unrolls in the shape of a red butterfly. Its wings read "SKARA'S 15th".]

Skara: Invite only, but you witches are my VIPs!

Amity: Are these made of real insect wings?

Skara: My dad spared no expense! You only turn 15 once!

Boscha: You only turn every age once, Skara.

Luz: Prepare thyself to do battle like a human! Thumb war!!

Willow: [laughs] It's funny 'cause it's stupid!

Boscha: It's so weird that a human goes here now. Too bad she's already burned her social life at the stake. Any friend of Willow's is an automatic dork. [the invite starts molting] Ugh! Skara! Why did you give me an invite that was molting? Gross! Give me another one.

[Boscha throws the invite on the floor. Two younger kids see it.]

Kid #1: [gasps] An invitation to Skara's party! I want it!

Kid #2: I want it!

Kid #1: It's mine!

Kid #2: No it's mine!

[The two kids start fighting.]

Teacher #1: Oh. Kid fight!

Teacher #2: Kid fight?

Detention Teacher: Kid fight!

[THEME]

[Cut to Luz and Willow at Luz's locker.]

Luz: Oh my gosh Willow, I'm so excited for photo class! I can't believe you can make pictures of your actual memories! [opens locker] I'ma see me some baby Willow!

Willow: I'll admit, I was adorable.

[Luz tries to take a book out of her locker, but it bites down on it.]

Luz: Don't eat that. [pulls at the book] Whoa! [falls]

Locker: [eats book, hisses]

Luz: Hiss! [stands]

Boscha: [laughing] I can't believe she'd even hang out with her! It's just embarrassing. [with her fingers like glasses] "Oh look at me! I'm going on a date with my ferns!"

[Skara laughs as she, Boscha, and Amity pass Luz and Willow. Willow wilts.]

Luz: That could be anyone!

Skara: Solid Willow impression, Boscha! Amity, weren't you friends with Willow?

[The three of them stop walking. Amity side-eyes Skara.]

Amity: I'm a Blight. We only associate with a select few. Keep annoying me though, I'm happy to select fewer. [walks off]

Skara: Oh, I coulda sworn that you guys hung out.

[Skara and Boscha follow Amity.]

Willow: [sighs]

[Cut to a darkroom-like classroom with students sitting in front of undeveloped photos.]

Luz: Alright memory melon, let's pick another juicy one!

Willow: Be careful with my brain!

[Luz pulls a photo out of Willow's ear with a pair of tweezers.]

Luz: Ooo, who says brain surgery is hard?

[Willow rubs her ear as Luz puts the empty photo on a wire.]

Photo Teacher: How's your work? Note that some prints have greater clarity than others. These are moments that invoke strong emotional response.

Luz: All the colors of the brainbow.

[Luz goes to touch the photo. A big blue hand that has "HALT" on it stops her.]

Photo Teacher: But, if you damage the prints, you'll damage the memories themselves! Be extremely careful. [walks away]

Luz: Whoa. Photo class is intense.

[One photo develops, showing Willow on a chair, blushing a bit, with a band-aid on her cheek, and with wavy and poofy hair.]

Luz: Oh my gosh, Willow, you had an awkward hair phase, too? I knew we were meant to be friends.

[She holds up a picture day photo of her as a child with her hair done up in three awkward braids, each sporting two bows. There are also stickers in her hair.]

Luz: Ooo there's more!

[The rest of the photos develop: Willow being pushed on a swing by her dads, Willow feeding as spider demon, Willow and her dads at what looks like a winter holiday, and Amity hugging Willow at a birthday party.]

Luz: [gasps]

Willow: Ugh. [turns away]

Luz: Hey, I know you and Amity have a history. Wouldn't you feel better talking about it?

Willow: No, I'd rather do this. [flips photo around] That's my motto after all! "Out of sight, out of mind."

[The bell screams and rings. Students begin leaving.]

Luz: If you won't tell me what she did, I'll never be able to cook up a scheme to make you friends again.

Willow: Luz, I get it, but I don't want you to do that. No schemes, no plots, no ruses, none! Okay? Now let's get to lunch! [leaves]

Luz: [looks at the photos] She never did mention anything about... shenanigans.

[Luz turns the photo back around. She follows Willow out of the classroom as Boscha and Amity come from the opposite direction.]

Luz: Wait up!

Boscha: [to Amity] I can't believe I made him cry. Like, he's the teacher.

[As they pass photo class, Amity stops.]

Amity: Hm?

[She looks at Willow's memory photos, specifically the birthday party one.]

Amity: Oh no.

Boscha: Why do you look like you've seen a ghost? Is there a ghost in photo class? Are they cute!?

[Amity tries to block Boscha's view with her hand.]

Amity: Yep, just a super cute ghost. But they're all mine! [slams door]

Boscha: Ask if they have any friends!

Amity: [takes down the photo] Willow, [sighs] I'm sorry. But I have to do this.

[Amity summons a small flame and burns her face off the photo. She blows on the embers to put it out, puts the photo back, and start to leave. The photo reignites. Amity stops at the door.]

Amity: Huh? [turns around] Oh, no. No, no, no, no! [approaches the photo] Um, uh....

[Amity blows on the flame. It spreads to the other photos.]

Amity: Oh, come on!

[Cut to the cafeteria. Gus is looking at a corkboard titled "WHO TO INTERVIEW".]

Luz: Hey there, detective. Are you solving a crime or about to commit one?

Gus: Sadly, this is one problem crime can't solve. My interview for journalism class is due tomorrow! I'm supposed to choose someone "interesting, accomplished, and noteworthy." People aren't meant to be all those things! Curse your need for perfection, Gus!

Luz: Okay buddy, okay. [gives Gus apple blood] So, Willow-- whoa. Are you okay?

Willow: [sweating] When did it get so hot?

[Willow drinks water and exhales steam. She pours herself another cup, then just douses herself with the pitcher, releasing more steam. Gus sips at his apple blood, looking confused, while Luz looks concerned. Steam comes out of Willow's ears as she cleans her glasses. When she puts them back on, her pupils dilate until her eyes are completely black.]

Willow: Uhh, hi! I'm Willow! Remind me of your names?

Gus: This is serious journalism, Willow. Clowning around will get you nowhere.

Willow: I'm-I'm serious! Who-who are you?

Gus: I'll admit, this amnesia spin has piqued my interest.

Luz: Gus, it really seems like she's forgotten us, like her memory is- [gasps] Like her memory is gone!

[Cut to photo class as Gus and Luz run in, Willow walking drunkenly behind them.]

Gus: Hexside Free Press! What's going on here?

Luz: [gasps]

[Amity is desperately trying to blow out the flames. She notices the others.]

Amity: ....Hi

Luz: You destroyed Willow's memories?!

Amity: I-I saved as many as I could!

[She holds up the picture of Willow's awkward hair phase, another one behind it. An ember burns both of them to ash. Amity and Luz watch the ashes fall.]

Amity: Ugh! Why would they make memories so flammable!?

Willow: [giggles, wiggling her fingers] Have I always had this crazy thing? [slaps her face gently] Blap, blap! [walks to Amity and Luz and puts her arms around their shoulders] Eeee, heee, heee, I can tell we're gonna be good friends! [falls]

[Cut to the Owl House.]

Amity: [looking around] So, this is the Owl House.

Luz: Yup.

Amity: And you... sleep here?

Luz: When the night critters allow me to.

Eda: So, you set Willow's memories on fire and erased everything. Even minor damage can have huge effects!

[Willow walks into the couch where King is sleeping.]

Willow: Ahh, a chair for sitting!

[Willow flops face front onto the couch, does a handstand while trying to sit, and then flops upside down.]

Eda: Yep, her brain's burned up real good. Damage like that can change everything about a person. Willow may never be the same.

[Willow finally gets the sitting position right.]

Willow: I got it! [looks at King] Ooh, a furry fruit! [picks King up] I'm gonna peel it!

King: What? [tries to escape as she begins] What is happening?!

Eda: Nap time.

[Eda casts a spell, putting Willow to sleep.]

King: Sleep spell...

[King yawns and goes to sleep.]

Eda: I didn't cast it on you.

King: [yawns] Yeah, who cares?

Luz: Is there anything we can do?

Eda: There is one way, but it's terribly dangerous and partially illegal. [pause] So you're in the right place! I'll send you into her mind to fix the damage.

Luz: Be still my fantasy loving heart, I have always wanted to do this! Thank you, Boiling Isles.

Eda: It won't be easy. You have a lot to fix in there, 'cause it's a mess! Yep, whoever did this to Willow showed unbelievable disregard for her safety, downright despicable.

[Amity looks away, guilty.]

Eda: [to Amity] Oh right, it was you. [to Luz] Anyways, Luz, who's going inside with you?

Hooty: [opens door] Maybe I can help! I'm pretty good at getting stuck inside people's heads!

Eda: This is someone's brain, not a night club! [spells door closed] Two max.

[Luz looks at Gus, who is pacing in front of his corkboard.]

Gus: I'm running out of time. Ugh. I'm in total free fall! [looks at a pile of books] Must I turn to forbidden sources?

Books: [growl]

Gus: Aah! [falls]

Luz: Gus... has a lot on his plate. Amity, you have to go with me.

Amity: Willow might not want me in there.

Luz: You set everything in there on fire! You have to help.

[Amity looks at Luz and thinks for a second.]

Amity: [sighs] Okay, I'll do what I can.

[Luz holds her hand out to Amity. She hesitantly takes it.]

Eda: Alright! Bold choice, taking the girl who caused the mess. [draws a spell circle around them and summons a bell]

Luz: [takes bell] Whoa.

Eda: When you're done, ring that and I'll cast you back-- Oh, and keep an eye out for her "Inner Willow." She's the gatekeeper of emotions and memory. She might help ya.

[Eda lifts her hand. The spell circle around Luz and Amity produces a light that encases them.]

Eda: Now, here we go!

Luz & Amity: Ah!

[Luz and Amity disappear into the yellow light of the spell. Eda directs it to Willow, still fast asleep. Cut to a black void inside Willow's mind, where Luz and Amity land.]

Luz: AH! [almost falls]

[Light appears and bursts forward. Luz and Amity shield their eyes. When the light dims, they're standing in a forest, each tree growing around a dark picture frame. Luz and Amity look around and start walking.]

Amity: Where's her Inner Willow? Do you really think it'll help?

Luz: I don't know. We'll just have to start fixing stuff on our own! Hmm, now let's see...

[Luz blows dust off a frame and coughs. It's a picture of a fort on a beach. Luz touches it with her hand, which goes through the picture.]

Luz: [poking it more times] Hey, I found something magical. I'ma put my face in it! [laughs as she enters the picture]

Amity: Luz? Luz!

Luz: [sticks her head out the picture] I think I found the memories. Let's go! [drags Amity in]

Amity: Aah!

[Luz and Amity fall through the opposite side of the picture, landing face first.]

Luz: Woo!

Amity: Ah!

Luz: [sits up] And welcome to Willow's beautiful... memory?

[The memory is in grayscale and burning. They're at a grassy beach with a dock and sign that reads "LAKE LACUNA".]

Amity: Lake Lacuna! This is where Willow and I took swimming lessons! The ash must be from the fires. [gasps] Our fort! In the dunes!

[They run up to the fort. Amity starts taking things off of it.]

Amity: One time Willow wanted to play hooky from our swim lessons, so we built this! [shoves a plank in Luz's hands]

Luz: Forts, hooky, Willow. Can words get any cuter?

Amity: We knew the swim teacher would be on the prowl, but Willow said she'd protect us with an illusion spell. [looks at the fort in pride]

Luz: Wha? It's like dog house for angels!

Amity: Wait, something is missing.

[Amity looks down. She swipes sand off a small flag reading "A+W". She smiles at it fondly before putting it in a small flowerpot tied to the top of the fort.]

Amity: There.

[The memory's color returns. Amity and Luz appear back outside the memory picture in Willow's mind.]

Amity: [looks around] We're back!

Luz: I think fixing the fort fixed the memory!

[The memory starts playing in color, showing a young Amity and Willow laughing and entering the fort.]

Young Amity: Ugh! The seagulls are back again!

Young Willow: Don't worry, I'll get rid of them!

[Young Willow casts a spell. Instead of getting rid of the seagulls, she gets rid of the fort. The seagulls attack them as the fort reappears.]

Young Willow & Young Amity: [yell]

Young Amity: Willow!

Young Willow: I'm sorry, I thought I was getting better!

[The swim teacher spots Amity and Willow and drags them back to class.]

Amity: Willow was a... late bloomer.

Luz: I know, but now she's more like a great bloomer! This place is like theater showing her most important moments! Now let's fix some more! [runs up to the birthday party picture] The photo that started it all! Let's do it next.

[Amity visibly panics. Luz starts to climb into the picture.]

Amity: Wait! Uhh. You want important moments? [gestures to the awkward hair day picture] This one might be about a crush! [smiles nervously]

Luz: Hmm, don't mind if I do! [laughs]

[They both climb in. A pink firey foot steps on the ground.]

[Cut back to the Owl House, where Willow is still sleeping. Gus is pacing in front of her.]

Gus: No one can give me the interview I need, except... myself! [creates illusion double]

Gus's Illusion: I'd rather die than expose my secrets!

Gus: [rolls up sleeves] Then die you shall!

[Gus and his illusion strike fighting poses.]

Eda: Ahem. If you need an interview, look no further. Interesting? I'm a bad girl living in a secret fortress.

Hooty: [crashes through the window] I'm the secret!

Eda: Shh! [floats] Noteworthy? [gestures to wanted poster] I'm public enemy number one. Accomplished? I'm the greatest witch who ever lived!

[The mural on the ceiling glows as Eda poses dramatically. Gus turns to his illusion.]

Gus: What do you think?

King: I think not! [bursts through Illusion Gus's chest]

Gus: Aaa!

King: If you're handing out attention, I deserve it. Nyeh!

[King jumps to the floor. Gus's illusion disappears in a puff of blue. The real Gus looks at King and Eda.]

Gus: I will choose one of you, but which one? If you want to get picked, you'll have to impress me.

[King and Eda glare at each other.]

[Cut to Willow's mind. Montage of Luz and Amity fixing Willow's memories: Willow and her dads playing on the swings. Willow and Amity reading 13+ romance novels only to run from the librarian. Amity waving for Willow to join her on the "Roller Ghoster."]

Young Willow: [screams] I don't feel so good!

Luz: We don't need to see how this one ends... [turns the memory around]

Amity: Yeah, Willow threw up a lot that day. That's when you knew she was havin' fun.

Luz: Ew... I mean, aw!

[Amity looks downcast.]

Luz: Hey, you okay?

Amity: Yeah, I just... I can't believe I almost erased all of this. I really messed things up.

Luz: Don't worry. We've gotten really good at fixing memories! I won't rest until we've got this all sorted out. Repeat after me: "We can fix this together!" Come on!

Amity: [smiles] We can fix this together. [blushes]

Luz: Heck yeah we can! I know some of these memories must be painful for you, but, what happened to you guys? And why are you trying to hide it?

Amity: I just...

[Amity notices a pink fire monster stepping out from behind a tree.]

Amity: [gasps, points] What's that!?

[Luz turns to see nothing.]

Luz: Look, if you don't wanna talk about it, just say so. [walks off]

Amity: No, I actually saw something! At least I... I think I did.

Luz: If you need me, I shall be fixing this memory of a ball pit.

Amity: Wait, that's not--

Luz: [enters, immediately ducks back out with an egg on her head] It's eggs! It's full of eggs! Why is this memory full of eggs?!

Amity: Yeah, that one's hard to explain.

[Cut to the Owl House. King is looking at himself in a hand mirror.]

Eda: Just give up, King, 'cause I got this.

King: You got nothing. No one could turn down an interview with someone this pretty!

[The lights flick off.]

King: [drops mirror] Weh?

Eda: Hm?

Gus: [summons a ball of light] If you want this interview, you're gonna have to start answering some tough questions. [to King] Where were you born?

King: Weh?

Gus: [to Eda] What'd you eat for breakfast this morning?

Eda: Wha?

Gus: [to King] What's your greatest strength?

King: My decisiveness. W-wa-Wait, I changed my mind!

Gus: This will be the single greatest interview of all time. So if you want it, you'll have to dazzle me! [turns one ball of light into dozens]

Eda: The kid scares me.

[Cut to Willow's mind. Luz is pulling an egg shell off her head.]

Amity: We're getting pretty good at fixing these.

Luz: [inhales] Phew! [tosses egg] Yeah. And there's only one last memory to fix! The one you're suspiciously avoiding.

Amity: Me? Avoid? No. But let's skip it! Where's Eda's bell?

[Amity runs at Luz. Luz stops her with one hand on Amity's face.]

Luz: Amity, you gotta stop being weird. We have to fix all of them. Unless... there's something in there you don't want me to see.

[Amity crosses her arms defensively.]

Luz: Look, I'm not here to judge, I'm just here to help Willow.

Amity: Help? All you're doing is prying into your friends lives!

[Luz looks ashamed. Smoke drifts in.]

Amity: Well, did you ever think maybe it's none of your business? [sniffs] Is something...burning?

Luz & Amity: [gasps]

[Luz and Amity turn to see pink flames destroying the memories they had just fixed.]

Luz: Look!

[The pink monster reappears and runs toward the two, causing them to scream.]

Amity: Hide, hide, hide!

[Amity drags Luz behind the egg memory tree. The pink monster jumps into the photo. Luz and Amity look at the photo as it reignites.]

Luz: Oh no! That thing is burning up all the memories!

Amity: Please call Eda, I don't wanna be here when it comes out!

[Luz grabs the bell and rings it. Cut to the Owl House, where Eda is ringing several bells, with even more on the coffee table in front of her.]

Eda: How's that for interesting? There's levels to me kid, levels I say!

Gus: Yes, that was nice.

King: No it wasn't! If you want noise, I'll give you noise!

[King slides on the table, sending the bells flying. He slams a spoon against a metal sheet. Gus smiles and writes on his notepad. Cut back into Willow's mind.]

Amity: [ringing the bell with every word] Why won't she answer?

Luz: Yeah... she's not super reliable.

[The flames behind them grow.]

Luz: Run!

Amity: AH!

[Luz and Amity run as the monster emerges. It enters several more photos.]

Amity: Why is it destroying all the photos?

Luz: I don't know. [looks at the swing photo] That one hasnt been burned, [looks at the holiday photo] or that one! [looks at the library photo, gasps] Amity, that thing isn't after any photo. It's after you!

[The monster turns and locks eyes with Amity.]

Amity: What?

Monster: [growls, burns brighter, runs]

Luz: Run! I have an idea! [shoves Amity to the beach photo]

Amity: We can't go in there, I'm in there!

Luz: Just trust me!

[Luz shoves Amity in. She checks to see if the monster is following them before jumping in herself. Both land on their faces. Luz stands and drags her finger in the sand, drawing a large circle.

Luz: Time for a swimming lesson!

[Luz slams the circle. The inside of it turns blue, and the inner lines of the ice glyph appear (though the central vertical line is missing). A pillar of ice begins to grow from the glyph. The monster leaps through the photo and lands on the pillar as it grows, and the monster slides into the lake. Luz and Amity look around the pillar.]

Luz: Woo! Teamwork baby!

[Luz hugs Amity, causing her to blush. Amity looks down at Luz's arms, then up at the lake.]

Amity: Luz.

[A shadow is standing in the lake, obscured by fog. The fog clears, revealing Willow, pink flames around her. She looks at Luz and Amity.]

Amity: Are you... the Inner Willow?

Inner Willow: [eyes turn completely purple] I was. Love, sadness, fear. [her footsteps leave flames in the sand] I used to be a being made of all emotions. But ever since you set Willow's mind on fire, all I can feel is anger! [anger echoes]

[Her hands ignite in flames. Around them, the memory starts to burn again. A tree is set on fire, then another, and then the fort. The flag burns to ash. Luz and Amity watch the destruction.]

Luz: Please! Stop!

Inner Willow: But Amity wanted this. [summons the birthday party photo, grabs it with a hand made of fire] Every moment she touched, I'm going to burn.

Amity: You're just hurting Willow. Why are you doing this?

Inner Willow: [getting in Amity's face] Still haven't figured it out yet? Then I'll show you! [throws Amity into the memory, turns to Luz] You wanted to know everything, right? Then come take a trip down memory lane.

Luz: You're saying it all creepy, but I like the sound of-- whoa!

[Inner Willow grabs Luz by the cowl and tosses her through the memory. Cut to Amity's childhood bedroom. Amity bounces off her bed and lands on her feet. Luz flies through the air and crashes into something. She walks over to Amity while rubbing her head.]

Luz: Where are we?

[Inner Willow floats into the memory. Amity hides behind Luz.]

Inner Willow: You said I was hurting Willow? I was just finishing what you started!

[With a bell toll and a flash of flame, the memory begins playing. The door to Young Amity's room opens, and Young Amity and Young Willow enter.]

Young Amity: You have to get out Willow, now!

Young Willow: Wait, why?

Young Amity: Because, because-

Young Willow: Is it because I still can't do magic?! [grabs Young Amity's hand] Amity, I'm-- I'm sorry I got us in trouble at the beach, I just-- I can't get the spells right.

Young Amity: [rips her hand away] Well yes, that, that is why! Because you're a weakling! You can't do magic so I don't wanna be your friend. Now, go!

[Inner Willow makes them disappear into dust. Young Amity's scowl disappears to reveal Amity's resigned expression, while Young Willow's tearful face reveals Inner Willow's furious one.]

Inner Willow: Then you let your new friends pick on her for years. All because you thought she was weak. [floats] Well, now I can erase all that pain. After all, [eyes turn black] out of sight, out of mind.

Luz: Amity!

[A ring of fire circles around Amity's feet.]

Amity: Wait! Please.

[The flames disappear.]

Amity: Before all this started, there-- there was something else.

[Something bangs on the door.]

Alador: Amity?

[The door opens. A light turns on in the darkness behind it, showing Young Amity, her parents' shadows looming over her.]

Odalia: What is Willow doing here? She wasn't on the guest list for a reason.

Young Amity: But, she's...she's my best friend!

[Inner Willow is surprised by that.]

Alador: Nonsense, Blights only associate with the strongest of witchlings. You can choose a new friend from one of the suitable companions we invited.

[A black and white picture of young Boscha and Skara appears next to the Blights, both witchlings looking bored.]

Young Amity: But they're mean! Just because you work with their parents doesn't mean I have to like them!

Odalia: Good children don't squabble, dear. Sever your ties with Willow, and if you don't...

Alador: Then we will.

Young Amity: [gasps]

Odalia: We'll make sure the girl is never admitted into Hexside. Now go, and try not to make a scene.

[The door closes. All color in the room fades as flames go out.]

Amity: Willow, you were never too weak to be my friend. I was too weak to be yours. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise you this. [grabs Skara's invite out of her pocket] I won't let Boscha and her gang pick on you ever again! [tugs on Skara's invite] I'm not actually gonna rip it because it's a real butterfly, but you get the gesture, right? [pockets the invite, holds out her hand]

[Inner Willow turns, tears in her eyes.]

Inner Willow: I do. [grabs Amity's hand] I think Willow should keep her memories of you. The good, and the bad.

Amity: [full of emotion] Me too.

Luz: Then, if it's okay, Amity and I still have some work to do.

[Inner Willow nods. The three of them put their heads together. A flash of light later, they're back in the main forest of Willow's mind. Luz hands Amity the repaired birthday photo. Amity hangs it in the tree. Young Inner Willow runs behind them, making them turn around. Inner Willow walks out from behind a tree, no longer surrounded by pink flames, holding Young Inner Willow's hand. Amity waves at them. Luz is ugly crying. Young Inner Willow turns to leave and walks face-first into a tree. She giggles and runs off. Inner Willow waves and follows her.]

Luz: So, does this mean you and Willow are buddies again?

Amity: I'm not sure.

Luz: Well, [pulls out bell] why don't we go see? [rings bell]

[Cut to the Owl House. Eda and King are panting, posing on the coffee table. Various items litter the floor.]

Eda: So? Who got the gig, kid?

Gus: Well, this has been the hardest choice of my entire life. But with the public interest in mind, the interview goes to... [dramatic pause] Hooty!

Eda: Hooty?

King: Hooty?

Hooty: [opens door] Hoot?

Gus: Well, your performances got me thinking. What could create such interesting people? Only the Owl House itself.

Hooty: [gasps] Aaaaah!

Gus: Tell me everything, Mr. Hooty!

Hooty: I've been waiting to hear those words all my life! [closes door, muffled] Where to begin? It all started with a hunt. Blood red skies. That's right, I was...

Eda: Ooooh, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna bake that bird in a pie!

King: I'm gonna bake that kid into a pie!

[bell rings]

Eda: Huh? [looks at Willow] Oh, right, I put people in there.

[Eda summons Luz and Amity from Willow's mind. They land with a puff of yellow smoke, holding hands. The bell disappears from Luz's hand.]

Luz: Whoa. What went down here? Where's Gus? What did you do with Gus?

Eda: He's fine, he's just dead to us.

[Eda and King leave.]

Luz: Those are very mixed messages.

[Willow wakes up.]

Luz: Willow! Do you know who I am?

Willow: [sits up] A friendly scarecrow? Ha! just messing, I remember everything!

Luz: She's back, folks! My girl's back! I'm gonna hug you so hard you'll never forget me again! [hugs her]

[Amity turns, looking hurt, and starts to leave. Luz watches her open the door. Amity gives her a shy wave and takes a step out the door.]

Willow: [to Amity] I remember what you did too.

[Amity stops and looks back.]

Willow: What you did in there. [points to her head] I can't say we're friends, but it's... a start.

[Amity waves again, smiling. She leaves and closes the door behind her.]

Willow: Luz, question: how did Amity happen to see the photo I hid in class?

Luz: You said nothing about shenanigans...

Hooty: My first word was hoot. My second word was hoot-hoot. My third word--

Gus: Hooty, you gotta stay on track here buddy!

[Amity stops walking. She reaches into her pocket and lets the invite unfold. Smiling, she lets it fly off and walks away.]

Hooty: Here's a song I wrote! Bored bored bored, bored bored bored.

Gus: Ah! [throws notepad and pencil] I can't take this anymore! [leaves]

Hooty: Here a hoot, there a hoot, somewhere else a hoot hoot, hooty-hoot hoot!

Boscha: You are talented. You are a star. You may be hated, so long as you are feared. Most important of all, you are a winner.

[Boscha rips off a page of her calendar before walking out the door, revealing the whole month has been marked Grudgby Season. Cut to Boscha walking through Bonesborough dribbling a grudgby ball, passing several mesmerized onlookers.] 

Old Woman: There she goes, captain of the Banshees. Off to win another championship for Hexside.

Mother: [to her child] Why cant you be more like her?

Child: [Breathes in deeply with an annoyed expression]

[Boscha approaches Hexside, with a banner reading Go get em, Banshees magically unfurling over the school. Skara, Amelia, and Cat form up behind Boscha.]

Boscha: Alright, girls. You know the drill. Captain goes first. [enters the school] Hello, Hexside! Your star has arrived. Groveling line starts here. [looks around] Somethings not right. Nobodys here!

Students: [Laughing from a distance]

[Boscha peers around a corner, spotting a crowd of students gathered around Willow, who is holding a potted plant.]

Hexside Student: No way!

Potions Student: Do me next. Do me! 

[Willow uses her magic, the plant sprouting a fruit looking like the potions students face. The student takes it.]

Potions Student: Welcome to the world, little buddy. Youre the coolest, Willow.

Willow: Aw, shucks!

Oracle Student: Yeah, Willow rules!

Boscha: [walking past with her posse] Wow, she has to make friends out of plants. How sad.

Amity: [entering] Oh, please! You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition. But I grew up. When will you?

[The crowd of students laugh.]

Boscha: Oh, this is not gonna fly.

[THEME]

[Cut to outside of Hexisde. Eda and Luz fly in on Eda's staff.] 

Luz: My first Grudgby season! Im so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!

[Camera pans to a ghost holding pom-poms.]

Ghost: Why do I even bother? [groans and floats away]

Eda: Ah, Grudgby season is the best. You know, I used to play, back in my gory days.

Luz: You mean glory days?

Eda: Well, that too. I was unstoppable on the field. I had the best moves and the best cheats.

Luz: Cheating isnt anything to brag about. How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?

Eda: Ugh. What do humans know, with your goody-goody attitude? If cheaters never prosper, why was I the star player?

Luz: Well, cant reason with crazy. [pulls a sleeping King out of her hood] Bye King, you little snoozers.

[Luz kisses King's head and puts him on the staff as he wakes up. Luz leaves. King scurries into Eda's hair.]

King: Ugh. Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here? [He throws a bag of onion rings from Eda's hair, then pulls out a rat] Get your own scalp, buddy. This ones taken. [throws the rat]

Eda: All this talk of Grudgby has me feeling nostalgic. Whaddya say you and me take a little trip down memory lane?

King: Hard pass.

Eda: Thats the spirit.

Ghost: You mean me?

Eda: Ugh. Come on! [flies away]

Ghost: Oh.

[Cut to a history classroom within Hexside.]

Teacher: Over 50 years ago, Emperor Belos appointed a head witch to each coven. [Continues talking]

Luz: [to Gus and Willow] I cant wait for Grudgby season to start! Ive studied up on all sorts of magical sports. Like this. [holds up a DVD case] Good Witch Azura 2: The Field of Deadly Fates. A classic underdog tale.

Willow: [taking the DVD case] Azura challenges Hecate in the smibbitch championship. But will she risk it all by taking a chance on the deadly Thorn Vault? [opens case]

Gus: [grabbing the DVD] Ooh, a shiny cookie. [tries to eat it]

Luz: [grabbing the DVD from Gus] Not food.

Teacher: The council headquarters was built and paid for by...? Anyone? Willow?

Willow: [stands up] Uh, the Pixie Dust Taxes?

Oracle Student: [from the hall] Whoo, yeah! Go, Willow!

Teacher: Impressive, Miss Park.

[The students murmur in admiration.]

Luz: Whats going on? Its like all of Hexsides caught Willow fever!

Willow: Ever since I patched thing up with Amity, Ive been feeling more confident. [gesturing to the flower shaped hair clip she's wearing] I guess it shows.

[The hair clip levitates off of Willow's head and into Boschas hand.] 

Boscha: Aw, Willow thinks shes popular now. How cute.

Luz: Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute. But give that back!

[Luz grabs for the hair clip. Boscha pulls her hand back.]

Boscha: Its weird that Amity hangs out with you now. Ever since Grom, shes gone soft. But dont worry. [puts clip in her hair] Im still here to show you whos boss.

Gus: [grabs the hair clip] Here, Willow.

[Gus puts the clip back in Willow's hair.]

Boscha: Oh-ho-ho! The friends wanna get in on this too, huh?

[Boscha levitates Willows bag into the air, spilling its contents onto Gus, Luz, and Willow.]

Boscha: [laughs]

Teacher: Is that laughter? Hey, hey! Learnings not supposed to be fun!

Luz: We are having zero fun, I swear. Boschas picking on us.

Boscha: My apologies, sir. I was practicing my aim for Grudgby. [throws an eraser at Willow]

Teacher: Boscha, how could you throw things at them... [draws a circle on his chest] when you could throw things at me? Am I over here? Or am I over here? Anything for the captain of the Banshees! 

Boscha: Oh, thanks, but I already have the perfect targets. [throws gum into Willows hair]

Willow: Oh! [groans]

Luz: Dont worry, its not like she can follow us around all day, right?

[Cut to Hexsides front steps. Gus, Luz, and Willow are covered in trash, their faces graffitied with insults.]

Luz: She followed us around all day. She literally followed us around all day!

Willow: [sighs] Im really sorry I pulled you guys into this. We should have just kept a low profile. Boscha could get away with murder if she wanted to. 

Principal Bump: [going down the stairs] Whats this? Boscha got away with murder? I cant say I approve, but at least shes trying new things. [leaves]

Luz: We will find a way out of this. 

[Amity passes by the stairs.]

Luz: Amity! 

[Luz cleans herself off before running up to Amity.]

Amity: Oh, Luz! Youre here! I mean, obviously youre here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me... Ive been talking for too long. 

Luz: Amity, we need your help.

Amity: Yes, I can help...! With what, exactly?

Luz: Boscha wont stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because shes the Star Captain of the Grudgby Team.

Amity: Yeah, this time of year, shes extra unbearable. 

Luz: Youre friends with her, can you help us? 

Amity: Uh, the hard part is, theres no reasoning with Boscha. She only speaks in Grudgby terms. 

Luz: Hmm. Okay, okay. Im pickin' up what youre puttin' down. 

Amity: [looking at the books she's holding] Im... not putting anything down. 

Willow: [screams]

[Trash falls on Willow from above as other students watch. Luz runs up to her.]

Luz: Willow! What happened?

Willow: Boscha happened.

Boscha: [from a second floor window, a trash can upside down in her hands] Hey Willow! I just thought all trash should stay in one spot. 

Luz: Thats it! Boscha! Willow challenges you to... a grudgby match! 

Boscha: [dropping the trash can] She what? 

Willow: I what?

[The trash can falls onto Gus.]

Gus: [from inside the trash can] She what? Seriously, whats going on here? 

[Cut to the Owl House. Eda is in her old Grudgby jacket, showing a photo album to King.]

Eda: And heres when we took down Epiderm High in the semi-finals. [points to photo of her younger self holding a trophy] Oh, I was the youngest on the team, but I had what some call star power. AKA, this. [pulls a box out from her hair labeled Edas Rad Cheats] This is my cheat box. I have all my best weapons in here. Smoke bombs, sock-worms... Mwah. You name it. Oh, I never lost a game with this bad boy. 

[The door slams open. Hooty enters.]

Hooty: Hoot-hoot! Guess who found a special friend in the forest. [He brings in Lilith, wrapped up in his elongated body] It was me. Hoot!

[Hooty releases Lilith, who falls to the floor.]

Eda: Lilith. 

Lilith: Edalyn.

Hooty: [pops up between them] Hooty!

Eda: Ugh. Scram, Hooty.

Hooty: Okay!

[Hooty's body retracts back into the front door, which then promptly slams shut.]

Lilith: Why are you in your old uniform? 

Eda: No reason. Its laundry day. What are you doing here?

Lilith: [summons scroll, clears throat, reads] Edalyn Clawthorne, you are hereby under arrest by the order of the Emperor of the Boiling Isles

[Eda uses her magic to roll up the scroll, which smacks Lilith in the face.]

Lilith: Ah!

Eda: You were saying? 

Lilith: Come on! I have to bring you in. Its time for you to join the coven. The Emperor has big plans for the Isles, and he wants you to be a part of it all.

Eda: [picks up the photo album; sarcastically] Ooh, Aah. What an incredible opportunity for me. 

Lilith: What are you even looking at? [grabs the photo album from Eda] Grudgby pictures? Feeling sentimental?

Eda: Pah! Me? Never. I was just telling King here how good I was. [summons Grudgby ball]

Lilith: Oh, Edalyn. Not only is the curse affecting your hair, but your memory as well. 

[Lilith holds up the picture of young Eda, unfolding it to reveal a young Lilith with an even larger grudgby trophy, and several medals.]

Eda: [groans] Ah, tell you what. Ill go with you peacefully to the Emperor...

Lilith: Really?

Eda: Sure. If you beat me at a game of Grudgby. Luz is always challenging people to things. Why not me?

Lilith: Hmm... Game on. 

[Cut back to Hexside.]

Willow: Luz, what are you doing? 

Luz: Im just following Amitys advice. Boscha only speaks in Grudgby terms. Trust me, I have a plan. 

[Luz walks up to Boscha, who is exiting the building.]

Boscha: Okay, maybe its the altitude of the second floor, but I thought I heard you say that Leaf Girl wanted to challenge me to a Grudgby match.

Luz: Thats right! Well settle this once and for all on the field.

[Students flank both of them. Willow runs up between them.]

Willow: Or we could just talk about our issues.

Boscha: Lets do this.

Willow: Oh, no. 

Luz: If Willows team wins, you dont get to pick on her anymore.

Boscha: Fine! And when we win, Willow and your team will be our water gofers.

Luz: Ha! Thats not even a punishment. I love water. 

Boscha: And we get to use you as target practice.

[Boscha throws the ball and kicks it, sending it straight through a tree trunk. The hole smokes.]

Boscha: See you after school, losers.

[The Banshees leave. The entire tree catches fire.]

Oracle Student: Whoo-hoo! Willow verses Boscha!

Amity: Luz, this isnt a good idea.

Willow: Yeah, Ive never even played Grudgby before! How am I supposed to beat Boscha? 

Luz: But youre the better witch. I dont know much about sports, but I know about sports movies. We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy. With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win. 

Willow: Well, if you think thisll work, then Im in. How about you, Gus?

Gus: In seasons past, [holds up a pair of flags] these flags have waved in support of Grudgby greats. Now they will wave for the greatest: Me! [waves flags]

Luz: What about you, Amity? 

Amity: Me? On a team with you? Running around in cute uniforms? Sweating? [Amity blushes heavily, then runs off] I gotta go!

Luz: Huh? Well, I guess shes out. In any case, lets get training! 

[Cut to Luz, Willow, and Gus at the Hexside Grudgby field.]

Luz: So, how exactly do we play Grudgby? 

Gus: Well, [He summons a miniature illusion of the field to demonstrate] theres a ball, and you score by getting the ball through the other teams goal. [the illusion dissipates]

Luz: That sounds easy.

Willow: It is, except...

[Willow summons a leaf and blows it onto the field. The leaf is quickly ripped to shreds by fire, vines, ice shards, and rock spikes that emerge from the field.]

Luz: Oh, right. Boiling Isles. Should have predicted this. 

[Luz sets her phone to play motivational sports music. She puts a sweatband on.]

Luz: Alright! Every great sports story includes a training montage. 

Gus: [raises hand] Whats a mon-tage?

Luz: Well

[Montage: Luz explains to Willow and Gus what a montage is using a chalkboard; Luz shows the two a football movie on a TV; the three of them have a tea party in animal onesies. Cut back to the Grudgby field.]

Gus: Oh, I get it now. Wait, were we just having a tea party in animal jammies?

Luz: What happens in the montage stays in the montage! Now lets hit the field.

[Luz blows a whistle, throwing a Grudgby ball at Gus and Willow. It hits the ground. Willow prepares to kick it, but a giant tentacle burst from the ground, throwing the ball. Willow catches it.]

Willow & Gus: [yell]

[They both across the field and away from the tentacle. A giant hand bursts from the ground, grabbing Gus. Flaming Grudgby balls follow Willow.]

Oracle Student: [from the bleachers] Woo! Go Willow!

[Willow runs the opposite direction. A trampoline emerges from the ground and launches her backwards.]

Oracle Student: Youll get em next time!

[Willow lands next to Luz, who hasn't moved at all.]

Willow: [sigh] I need a cup of water.

[Gus walks up to them and falls on the ground.]

Luz: Now for our big finale! Lets try... [activates a plant glyph] the Thorn Vault. [puts glyph on ground]

Willow: Luz, wait-

[Willow and Gus are launched into the air by a column of thorns. Willow summons a large plant to break their fall. Gus rolls right off of it.]

Gus: [groans]

Willow: Gus! Talk to me, Gus! 

Gus: I, I think somethings broken. [pulls out his flags, now snapped, and gasps] My flags! I never should have tried to play. You were always enough for me. [sobs]

[Willow looks down to see her hair clip, now snapped in half.]

Willow: Come on, Gus. I have some floral tape in the greenhouse. Well fix them.

Gus: [sniffs] Okay.

[Willow and Gus stand and begin walking away.]

Luz: Guys, lets try the Thorn Vault one more time. 

Willow: Not now, Luz. Were tired.

Luz: But were the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and

Willow: [walking up to Luz] Luz! Not everything can be solved with a good attitude and a dope music soundtrack. Were going to lose. And no movie can help us against that. The game is off. [leaves]

Luz: Willow, wait! 

[Luz looks down at the broken hair clip. She picks.]

[Cut to outside the Owl House, with a makeshift Grudgby field set up in front of it. Eda and Lilith approach each other from opposite sides. Hooty stretches out to be between them, now wearing a ref's hat and whistle.]

Hooty: You gals ready to hoot? We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed. 

King: [next to a scoreboard, dressed as a cheerleader] Yes! Now Ill strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.

Eda: [laughs, snorts] Yeah, intimidation armor. [to Lilith] Pushing paper all day might make you a little rusty. Ill try to go easy on you.

Lilith: Remember, dear sister, you may have been star player, but I was team captain for a reason.

Eda: [grunts]

[Hooty blows the whistle.]

[Cut back to the Hexside Grudgby field, Luz sitting on the bleachers. She repairs Willows hair clip with a band-aid. Amity walks up to her.]

Amity: Tough practice? [sits down next to Luz]

Luz: I pushed Willow and Gus too hard. Its just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on. Shes one of the best friends Ive ever had. Winning this game is the only way I know how to help. 

Amity: Did you know, before Boscha, I was the Grudgby team captain? 

Luz: Really?

Amity: Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget. 

[Fade to a flashback of Amity as captain of the Banshees.]

Amity: [voiceover] We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship. We had a move planned, and it was a good one. But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier. I changed our game plan to... the Thorn Vault.

Luz: Good Witch Azura 2: Field of Deadly Fates! You watched it too?

Amity: Uh, yeah.

[In the flashback, Amity successfully does the Thorn Vault, launching herself to a goal post and tossing the ball in. The score changes for a Banshee win. Amity cheers, then realizes she hurt her teammates.]

Amity: It went disastrously wrong. My teammates got hurt. All because I had an idea of how things should be. I pushed them too far.

[Fade back to Amity in the present.]

Amity: I never played again after that day.

[Amity turns to Luz, their faces incredibly close. Amity stumbles back and falls, blushing heavily.]

Luz: Wah! Sorry. [helps Amity up] I just really love backstories.

[The Banshees enter, walking onto the field.]

Luz: [putting something in Amitys hand] I know what to do to make this up to Willow. Thanks. [leaves]

[Amity looks at her hand, revealing Willows hair clip.]

Boscha: [to Luz] Its after school. Wheres the leader of your loser brigade? 

Luz: Im here on her behalf. We forfeit.

Amity: [gasps]

Luz: And Im here to tell you that Ill take Willows place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need. 

Boscha: Wow, youre really a good friend. [magically lights a Grudgby ball on fire] And a perfect target. 

Luz: [gasps]

Boscha: [throws ball at Luz] Think fast!

[Luz ducks out of the ball's path. Boscha summons more flaming Grudgby balls. Luz runs as the balls are sent at her. Amity runs off.]

[Cut to the school greenhouse. Willow tapes up Gus flags.]

Willow: There, that ought to do it. 

Gus: These are flags of surrender now.

Amity: [slams open the door] Luz needs our help! I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head. She can be so stupid, which I love I mean hate! In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet I mean, I hate it, and its dumb!

Gus: You lost me.

Amity: Just, here. 

[Amity gives Willow her hair clip. Willow smiles.]

Gus: Can we resist the call to action? No! May the flags be raised once more.

[Gus runs out, Willow and Amity right behind him.]

[Cut back to Eda & Liliths grudgby match. Eda tries scoring a goal, but Hooty blocks the ball.]

Hooty: Hoot!

Eda: Hooty! Whose side are you on?

Hooty: Im an unbiased participant, hoot-hoot.

[Lilith grabs the ball, successfully avoids Eda & Hooty, and scores a goal. King marks the score, now tied 5-5.]

King: Point goes to Lilith. Were at a tie here, folks.

[Eda and Lilith both pant in exhaustion.]

Hooty: Time for one more play. 

Eda: [pulls our her cheat box] Just one little trick and the game will be mine. 

[Eda opens her cheat box, only to find it empty, save for a note reading, I noticed your lunchbox was getting dirty so I cleaned it! LOVE, LUZ, with a drawing of a heart and Luz throwing a peace sign.]

Eda: Dang it, Luz! Your nonsense has gotten into my head. Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way.

Lilith: Taking your time. Nervous?

Eda: Not today, sister.

[Hooty blows the whistle, beginning play again. Eda and Lilith both jump for the ball. Eda grabs it and makes for the goal. Hooty emerges from the ground.]

Hooty: Its me again!

[Eda steps on his face, using him as a launchpad.]

Hooty: Ow!

[Lilith leans on his face.]

Hooty: Oh geez, hey!

Lilith: No!

Eda: Yeah!

[Eda scores the goal.]

King: Ha ha! Game over! Team Owl House rules supreme!

Eda: Yes! Still got it! Still got the skills to pay the bills!

Lilith: No! [on her knees, slamming her fists angrily at the ground] No! I cant go back to the Emperor empty-handed.

Eda: [sighs]

[Eda takes her ring off. She holds it out to Lilith.]

Eda: Here. Tell them I put up a heck of a struggle. 

Lilith: [takes the ring] I will be back for you. And next time, I wont be alone. 

Eda: Ill be waiting.

[Lilith looks over her shoulder at Eda, then walks into the distance.]

Hooty: Ill be waiting too! Hoot-hooty-hoot!

[Cut back to the Hexside grudgby field. Luz is running from Boschas Grudgby balls.]

Boscha: Having fun yet? Cause Im just getting warmed up.

[Boscha throws a flaming grudgby ball at Luz, which is sent back by a tree suddenly emerging from the field in front of Luz.]

Boscha: Huh?

Willow: Boscha. Your issue is with me, not Luz. Leave her be. 

Luz: Willow! [runs up to her] Willow, Im sorry I got you into this mess. Youre right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.

Willow: Its okay. I know you were just trying help in your Luz way. But now lets finish this... my way. [turns to Boscha] The game is back on.

Boscha: You need three players on your team. Wheres your third?

[Willow and Luz look to Gus in the bleachers, looking sadly at his flags.]

Willow: Uh, well

Amity: Right here. 

Boscha: You just destroyed your social life.

Amity: [looks at Willow and Luz] Nah. I think I made it better. 

Boscha: Ugh! Game on!

[Boscha stalks off. Amity, Luz, and Willow smile at each other. Cut to Boscha, Cat, and Amelia facing off against them, all six in Grudgby gear.]

Gus: Go Willow!

Willow: [to Boscha] Theres something on your shoe.

Boscha: [scoffs] Like Id fall for that.

[The ball is launched into the air. Boscha lunges for it but is stopped.]

Bosha: Huh?

[There are vines wrapped around her shoe. She falls over.]

Boscha: Oh!

[Willow catches the ball and makes the first goal.]

[The game progresses. Amity uses a giant abomination arm to hold back an axe for Luz, who scores another goal. Gus creates illusion duplicates of himself to cheer Luz, Amity, and Willow on. Amelia scores a goal for the Banshees]

Luz: Nice work.

Amelia: Thanks.

[The two high-five.]

Boscha: [annoyed] Hmm.

[The game progresses further. Boscha throws a flaming grudgby ball at Luz, who blocks with an ice glyph. Luz catches the ball, seeing a fire glyph burned onto it.]

Luz: Whoa.

[Luz puts a piece of paper onto the ball, burning the glyph onto the paper. She taps it, activating a fire spell.]

Luz: [gasps] Fire magic! [throws ball] Amity!

[Amity knocks it into the goal with a giant abomination fist.]

Amity: Yeah! [laughs happily]

[The score is now tied 9-9. Both teams huddle up.]

Amity: Theres time for one more play.

Willow: And this play could determine whether us underdogs win or lose. 

Luz: Heres what I have to offer. [holds out fire, light, plant, and ice glyphs]

Willow: I think we should try... [points to plant glyph] this one. 

Luz: [gasps] The Thorn Vault? Are you sure? 

Willow: Im ready this time. 

[Gus and his illusions cheer on as play resumes. The two teams face off at centerfield once again. The ball is launched into the air, and Luz catches it.]

Luz: Ha!

Amity: Watch out! 

[Amity pushes Luz out of the way of Boscha, getting tackled as a result.]

Luz: Amity!

Amity: Luz! 

[Luz activates the Thorn Vault, sending Willow across the field, and successfully scoring a goal]

Luz: Whoo! [hugs Willow] You did it, Willow! We did it! We Won! 

[Luz and Willow look to the score board, reading 9-10. Then the Banshees score changes to 999.]

Luz: Wait, what?

[Boscha holds up a golden insect.]

Willow: Oh, thorns.

Luz: Wh- What happened?

Willow: She caught the Rusty Smidge.

Luz: The what?

Boscha: Yeah, while you were celebrating your victory, I caught this guy. It means we automatically win. All magic sports are like this. 

Luz: That just invalidates all our efforts! If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else? Theres no reason to watch any of the other players! Thats such a stupid rule!

Boscha: Well, we beat them and proved our social dominance. All is right in the hierarchy. 

[Skara, Cat, and Amelia run up to Willow and Luz.]

Boscha: Hey!

Skara: Good game, Willow! 

Amelia: I had so much fun playing you guys.

Willow: Oh, really?

Cat: Willow, youre really good. Would you want to be on our team? 

Willow: Mm, thanks for the offer, but I think Im done with grudgby for a while. Hey, wheres...

[Amity groans, trying to stand up.]

Luz & Willow: Amity! [runs up to her]

Amity: I think I think I hurt my leg. But, Ill be okay. 

Luz: Are you sure? I could help carry you if it really hurts.

Amity: [blushing and chuckling nervously] Im fine! Whos Amity?

Luz: Aaaaand, scoop! [she picks Amity up]

Amity: [chuckling nervously] Oh, wow. Sports. 

Gus: Can we have another montage? 

Luz: Yeah! Montage, activate! 

[Montage: Gus, Luz, & Willow all score goals, then lounging in huge flowers with spring-like stems; Gus uses his illusion magic to change their teams score of 10 to 1000; the three run up to the Owl House. King dances in his cheerleader outfit while Luz records on her phone.]

King: [chuckles] Youre Youre not gonna show this to anyone, right?

Eda: Of course not. Keep cheering.

Luz: [chuckles]

[The montage ends with Amity, now with a cast on her leg, walking into the Owl House, with Hooty sitting her on the couch with Luz & Willow, surrounded by Gus, King, and Eda.]


Luz: [rolls over, breathes heavily]

[Flashback to events of the previous episode: Owlbert hopping through the portal door in Eda's tent with a sack in his beak, Luz running through behind him.]

Luz: Stop adorably hopping away, you... Huh?

[Cut to the living room, the first time Luz entered.]

Eda: Welcome to... [snaps fingers] ...the Owl House.

Luz: [gasps]

[Cut to Luz's first staff ride, whimsical music playing over the scene. Cut to present]

Luz: [wakes up with a gasp and looks around the room]

King: [snoring]

Luz: It wasn't a dream! [opens the window] Good morning, terrifying fantasy world.

Monster: [waving at her] Good morning. [sinks into the ocean]

Luz: Ughhh.

King: [snoring]

Luz: [picks up King] Good morning, you little cutie-pie. [kisses his head repeatedly]

King: I am not your cutie-pie!

Luz: Yes, you are. [hugs him tightly before putting him back down on her sleeping bag.]

King: [sighs] I know.

[Cut to Luz, fully dressed, opening the bathroom door. Several owls fly out of it, hooting. She watches them fly away before entering, walking backwards.]

Hooty: Hi, Luz!

Luz: [screams and karate chops Hooty's face]

Hooty: Ow! I'm just wishing you a good morning. [retreats to the front door] Jeez! Hoot! Ow!

Luz: Sorry, Hooty. [Looks at the bathroom counter and picks up her Azura book. Flips it open to a headshot of Azura and holds it up to the mirror] This is it, old girl. Your first day on the Boiling Isles, as a Witch Apprentice. [punches the air] Hyah! [opens a closet door while covering her eyes] Please have witchy clothes. Please have witchy clothes. Please have witchy clothes. [takes her hand off her eyes and sees a closet full of stereotypical witchy stuff] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! [screams]

[Cut to Luz writing "Witch Apprentice Luz" on a name tag and sticking it to her chest. She is now wearing a robe and what looks to be a witch's hat as she stands at the bottom of a staircase.]

Luz: [squeals]

[Toilet flushing. Eda's shadow appears on the wall before she steps into frame.]

Eda: [yawns] Hmm?

Luz: Good morning, Eda the Owl Lady. I am ready for my first day of Witch Apprenticeship.

Eda: Ugh! [shakes spiders out of her hair, picks another one out of her ear] Who are you, again?

Luz: Huh? [stares in horror as her name tag falls to the floor]

[THEME SONG]

Luz: [following Eda into the kitchen] Remember me? Luz? [grunts as a coffee cup hits her in the back of the head] We freed the oppressed and defeated the evil warden together? Yesterday?

Eda: Kid, lay off the details. I haven't even had my cup of apple blood yet.

Luz: You mean apple juice?

Eda: No.

[Eda sits on the kitchen table and drinks from her mug. King is sitting in a high chair and stabbing a fork into a yellow blob with eyes sitting on a plate.]

Luz: Teach me some spells. When do I get a magic staff? Was I supposed to bring my own runes? [gasps] Do you have a dangerous magical quest for me?

Eda: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, kid. Being a witch doesn't happen overnight. Also, you're wrapped in a bathrobe and wearing the dirtiest traffic cone I've ever seen.

[Luz pulls her hat off and blows on it, revealing that it was, in fact, a traffic cone with a severe layer of dust on it.]

King: [laughs]

Eda: But a magic staff, huh? You really want one?

Luz: More than anything.

Eda: Magic staff, come to me!

[She holds out her hand. For a second, nothing happens. Then several things crash distantly. King, Luz, and Eda all slowly turn to the sound, until Eda's staff appears and smacks her in the face, clattering to the ground.]

Eda: [grunts and picks the staff up, spinning it before tapping it on the ground] It's early. Now, witches are awarded their staffs from school. With me as your teacher, you'll be taking a different approach. [drops a bag of potions onto the floor] You'll have to work for it. [leads Luz through the living room] I run a few businesses. On weekends, I offer rare human treasures that Owlbert drags over from your side of the realm.

[She grabs a toy sword and hits a button near the pommel.]

Sword: I shall smite my enemies! Ages six to eleven.

Eda: [tosses the sword over Luz's head] But most days I sell only the finest homemade elixirs and potions.

Luz: [pulls a bottle from the bag and reads the label] "Snake oil."

Eda: No one wants an un-oiled snake. Follow me.

[Cut to Eda and Luz walking onto a balcony.]

Eda: Today you'll deliver packages and sell potions to that town over there, Bonesborough. You'll have to be careful. I have rivals everywhere who'd love to take my business down and you along with it. You wanted a dangerous magical quest? Sister, you've got one.

Luz: I won't let you down, Miss Eda.

[Luz turns to salute Eda, dropping the sack of potions off the balcony in the process. The two of them watch it fall, Luz wincing when it crashes loudly on the ground.]

Eda: I'm sure. [Cut to the living room, where Eda is pushing Luz out the door with a new bag of potions.] Remember, never befriend a man in sandals and always measure twice, cut once.

Luz: Uh...

Eda: Good luck! [slams the door closed and dusts her hands off, then looks at King] I hate to interrupt your power nap, but you have to go with her.

King: What? But I just found the perfect spot. Why do I have to go?

Eda: You and I know she's either going to get lost or eaten, probably both.

Luz: [squishes her face against the window] No, I won't.

Eda: [closes the blinds with a spell] And because you work for me, too, unless you want to start paying rent.

King: [throws a short tantrum before stomping out the door]

Eda: Be back by nightfall or risk mortal peril. [slams the door again]

Hooty: Have a nice trip.

King: Huh! Let's get this over with.

[Fade to Bonesborough. Luz and King walk through an archway.]

Luz: Woah!

[Zoom out to reveal a wall covered in wanted posters on either side of the archway. Various types of demons pass, all of which Luz stare at in amazement.]

King: Hey, it's rude to stare.

Luz: I've only seen places like this in my dreams. It's incredible. And I'm the only human here?

King: [shrugs] Haven't seen any others.

Luz: Wow! There must be a reason for that, right? Why am I here? What if I, Luz Noceda, average teen, actually had... [gasps] ...a predetermined path of greatness? [gasps] Just like Azura!

King: Yeah. Did Azura's path to greatness involve her delivering boil cream? [takes a potion labeled "Boil B' Gone" from the sack and holds it up]

Luz: Today I'm delivering packages, but tomorrow I'll be earning the respect of everyone on the Boiling Isles with my magical prowess.

King: Ha! Good luck. The Boiling Isles is nothing but a cesspool of despair.

Luz: More like a cesspool of delight.

[Luz puts the boil cream back in the sack before hefting it over her shoulder and looking around. She starts in the direction of the market, where she walks up to a centaur holding a pumpkin in front of his chest.]

Luz: What has four hooves and wants to buy a potion? This guy.

Centaur: [sighs and lowers the pumpkin to reveal his face is on his chest] My eyes are down here.

Luz: [exclaims]

[Cut to a house, where Luz rings the doorbell. She leaves her hand on the button, and the doorbell bites her hand and slowly starts to eat her arm. King walks away in annoyance.]

[Cut to a curb, where Luz and King are sitting, the latter scarfing down a Not Dog from the cart behind them.]

King: [sighs] I know I've had enough delight for one day.

Luz: I thought being the only human in a magical world would make me special. But apparently, it just makes everyone want to scream at me or... [holds up her arm to reveal a small winged creature biting her elbow] eat me. [flings the creature away and sighs, opening her book] At this point, Azura had already been sent on an enchanted quest. Where's my quest-granting wizard?

King: Sorry to break it to you, Luz, but no one here is that well-dressed.

Luz: This has been a rough day. [stands and hefts the potions sack over her shoulder with a grunt; takes out a piece of paper and starts down the alley] Let's just deliver this last package and go home. Maybe this world isn't what I thought it wa-- [gasps] Pretty!

[Cut to reveal a large castle with golden banners illuminated by sunlight. The doorbell is also made of gold, and towering wooden doors open after Luz presses it.]

King: Big houses always belong to big whackjobs. Let's kick the package inside and get outta here.

Luz: [walking inside and ignoring King] Hello?

King: Hey, wait. [runs after Luz, yelping when the doors slam behind him] Weh!

Luz: [entering a room] I-I'm delivering a package from Miss Eda, the Owl Lady. Huh?

[Lanterns around the room flare on, revealing it to be a massive library. They illuminate a grand staircase, above which is a painting of a wizard. Said wizard enters from a door in the same pose he has in the painting.]

Luz: [gasps] Today just got good.

[Ad break. Camera pans up the wizard.]

Luz: [dancing excitedly] Magical wizard!

King: Weird old man in jim-jams.

Adegast: [descending the stairs] I was in my oscillarium, reading the stars. And who might you be, with eyes full of curiosity?

Luz: Uh, I-I'm--

Adegast: [running up to the two of them] Young lady, dareth I say, I sense something unique about you. Please, won't you join me for tea?

[Adegast summons two chairs and a table of snacks. He sits down in the white throne.]

Luz: [gasps] Okay.

King: [grabbing Luz's leg] Let's scram! [climbs up to Luz's shoulder] Wizards are just old people with glitter in their pockets.

[Adegast takes a handful of glitter out of his pocket and drops it on the floor.]

King: I don't trust him.

Luz: But the stars on his robe are sparkling. And look, there's a baby fox in his beard.

[The baby fox giggles.]

Luz: Plus, I see scones on the table.

King: Where?

[King pants as he runs to the table. Luz follows him, dropping the bag of potions in front of the chair as she sits in it.]

Luz: We'd love to join you for tea.

[King munching]

Luz: [turns and notices a cart of potions] Do you sell potions, Sir Wizard?

Adegast: Please, call me Adegast. Ma'am, yes, I run a small business.

King: [munching, holds up an empty plate] You should run a small business of more scones into my mouth. [chuckles] Yes!

Adegast: I'm surprised to see you here. It was my understanding that Eda delivered the packages herself.

Luz: Well, I'm kinda, sorta, her apprentice.

Adegast: Oh! And how are you finding the experience so far?

Luz: [holds a fake grin before sighing] Can I be honest, Mr. Adegast? When I decided to stay in this magical world, I thought I was meant for something special. But Eda thinks I'm meant for chores and I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.

Adegast: [approaching Luz] Well, I have a quest--

Luz: A quest?

[cup shatters]

Adegast: [chuckles] You didn't let me finish. I have a question.

Luz: Oh.

Adegast: Would you like to go on a quest?

Luz: Yes!

Adegast: [reaches into his beard and pulls out a scroll] I might have just the thing. [unrolls the scroll to reveal a map] The prophecy speaks of a young human girl who will claim the Celestial Staff and free this world from an ancient evil. Perhaps thou hath cometh here for a reason.

Luz: Perhaps I hath. [takes the map]

Adegast: Should you believe yourself worthy to attempt this quest... [begins walking through his house]

Luz: [follows him] So worthy.

Adegast: ...you need to know the road is dark and perilous.

Luz: Love peril. Big fan of peril.

Adegast: And only the Chosen One can pull the staff from its post.

Luz: [stops walking] Chosen one.

King: [walking past Luz with the bag of potions] Neat story, awesome. Anyway, your food is gone and we are, too.

Luz: Yes, we have to go. And pack for this enchanted quest! I'm in.

Adegast: Wonderful.

[Cut to Luz's bedroom, where she's sheathing the toy sword from earlier. Around her are various potions, food, the quest scroll, and of course her Azura book.]

Luz: So, King, what kind of Chosen One should I be?

King: [kneading Luz's sleeping bag, yawns and lies down] Huh? What?

Luz: [picks up her book] Should I be full of optimism and goodness, like the Good Witch Azura? Or should I be like a bad girl Chosen One with black nail polish and a mysteriously withdrawn attitude? [uses the book as a mouth] "I act like I don't care, but I secretly do."

Eda: Oh, you guys talking about bad girls? Wait, what's going on?

King: Eda, tell Luz how dumb wizards are.

Eda: [gesturing with a severed arm and almost hitting King several times] Ugh! Wizards are the worst. Never trust a man in casual drapery. [laces her fingers with the severed arm's] Why?

King: Your wizard client told Luz... [laughs] she was a-- [laughing] was a Chosen One! [laughing]

Eda: Wait, wait, Luz? [snickers] [laughs so hard she falls back onto the floor]

King: He even gave her a map.

[Eda and King laugh as Luz hides behind her book, an embarrassed blush on her face.]

Eda: Let me see this map.

[Luz hands her the map. She inspects it for a few seconds.]

Eda: You didn't think this was real, did you?

Luz: What?

Eda: This map is bunk. There's no lake with a Celestial Staff on the Boiling Isles. I would have stolen it ages ago. [notes Luz's down face and hands her the map back] Ah, don't worry. Couple more months here and you won't look like such a mark.

Luz: Can I have some time alone?

[Eda shrugs and leaves the room. King hops off of Luz's sleeping bag and follows Eda. The door closes, casting the room in shadow.]

Luz: Maybe they were right. [leans against the wall before sliding down it to the floor] Huh?

[Sunlight is illuminating one corner of the map, revealing the word "one" in shining blue lettering. Luz holds the entire map up to the light revealing the message: "The chosen one The path will only appear to the worthy".]

Luz: "The path will only appear to the worthy." [gasps] That's why Eda couldn't see it. But am... I really worthy?

[Wind howls and opens the window. The map flies out of her grasp, landing next to her book. The wind flips the pages to show Azura standing loved and triumphant on a small hill, the people around her applauding as she holds a staff to the sun.]

Luz: I'll never know unless I try.

[Cut to the living room, where King is laying down on the couch.]

King: Finally! All that mean-spirited laughter made me sleepy.

Eda: Crony, wake up. You said that wizard was one of my clients?

King: Yes. Now go away.

Eda: I don't know him that well. [sits on the couch with enough force to send King flying into the air] And I don't trust this itch he's scratching in the human.

King: Less talky, more nappy.

Eda: [sighs]

[Cut to the door of Luz's room, which Eda pushes open.]

Eda: Hey, Luz? Aw, nuts.

[Her room is empty, the howling wind pushing open the window. Eda runs to the window.]

Eda: Hooty, where'd she go?

Hooty: Hoot, hoot. If you want the answer that you seek, solve my riddle within a week--

[Eda punches the wall hard enough to shake the whole house and leave cracks in the wall.]

Hooty: Ow! Okay, okay. She went into the forest towards Bonesborough. Sheesh!

Eda: Ugh!

[Cut to a sign proclaiming the city limits of Bonesborough, next to which is Luz.]

Luz: [inhales] My first mythical quest. Ha!

[She jumps and slides down an incline, then gets over a fallen log. A thick fog rolls in as she keeps walking.]

Luz: Okay. Got my scroll, got my youthful optimism, got my trusty weapon. [pulls out the sword and hits a button on it]

Sword: By the power of Skullgar, I am out of battery.

[The lights on the sword dim as Luz lowers it. She continues onward, ducking a branch and cutting a rope with the sword.]

Luz: You know, I wonder if I made the right choice by coming here. [gasps] Wow!

[Camera reveals a village full of cats wearing clothes and walking on two legs. Luz walks through the village, beaming as she looks around. She approaches a fountain in the middle of a square, from which a witch with a sword strapped to his waist emerges, flipping wet hair out of his face.]

Nevareth: I see. So you're the Chosen One. [scoffs] The Celestial Staff should've picked me, Nevareth Bladestrife, Teen Prince of Angstmore.

Luz: [staring at his biceps] Yes. Yes, I did make the right choice.

[Cut to an alley]

King: [sniffing] This is where we met the scones. I mean, the wizard. Whoa!

[Eda pushes aside a patched curtain.]

King: It wasn't like this before.

[The castle is now in complete ruin, with crumbling walls, no spire, and faded banners. One of the front doors is laying on the ground, and as they look, a chunk of wall falls from a pillar.]

Eda: I don't like this.

[A door creaks open, revealing the library. Tattered scrolls now litter the floor, shelves are broken, paintings are ripped, and chunks of debris are blocking the stairs. Eda steps forward, onto a bundle of scrolls. She picks them all up, each illuminated with the glowing message of: "The chosen one".]

Eda: I really don't like this.

[Cut to the middle of the woods, where Luz is walking with Nevareth and a flying onion with bat wings.]

Luz: Nevareth, your vengeful backstory is so compelling. And I'm lovin' your animal sidekick.

Nevareth: After my village was consumed, my heart has known nothing but vengeance.

[They stop walking.]

Luz: Nevareth!

Nevareth: Lady Luz, do you think love can bloom on the battlefield?

Luz: [turns and laughs to herself] This quest is questing in all the right ways.

[The three of them walk onto a bridge, yelping when a creature jumps in front of them.]

Nevareth: Ew.

Chris: [dances] Hum-di-diddle, to pass the bridge, you must first solve my riddle.

Luz: Hit me, little furry man.

Chris: Your quest shall stop if you fail this game. So tell me, my dear, what is my name?

Luz: Hmm. [bends down to inspect his nametag] Uh... Chris?

Chris: That's it. You may cross the bridge. And please take this, Chosen One. It shall help you on your journey. [hands her a ring]

Luz: Wow. This is amazing. Thank you. [puts the ring on]

Nevareth: Do you need a cape?

Luz: Nah, I think I'm goo--

Nevareth: You can use my shirt.

[Nevareth rips his shirt off and ties it like a cape over Luz's shoulders.]

Luz: Yes. I need a cape. [giggles]

Nevareth: Three cheers for the Chosen One. Hip, hip...

Everyone: Hurray!

Nevareth: Hip, hip...

Everyone: Hurray!

Nevareth: Hip, hip...

[Cut to Eda]

Eda: Oh, no.

[Her and King are standing in the cat village, which is now destroyed. Dark clouds hang in the sky and fog clouds hang in front of the houses.]

Eda: Are you sure she came here?

King: [sniffing] Can't mistake her smell. Like lemons and young, naïve confidence.

Eda: Hmm.

[Eda walks up to the fountain, which is now broken and covered in dying vines. A cat wrapped in vines is laying in the lower basin. Eda kneels in front of the fountain]

Eda: Hey! Wake up, you. [flicks the cat's head] What have you done with Luz? [shakes it] What's your endgame?

Cat: To find your pupil and still your wrath, look ahead and follow the path. [cackles as it disintegrates]

King: [gasps] The cat man melted!

Eda: [sighs and stands] It's a trap. They want me to follow Luz.

King: So, what do we do?

Eda: Hmm.

[Cut to the woods, where, along with Nevareth and Chris, Luz is walking with a fairy much less hostile than the one she met the day before.]

Luz: Thank you for inviting me to your feast, Princess. All your food was so tiny and cute.

Princess: [twirls her hands and creates two bracelets] For you, Chosen One.

Luz: [puts the bracelets on] Thank you. You have all been so kind and thoughtful. [jumps and strikes a pose] I hope this quest never ends.

Chris: Your quest will soon come to an end, for the staff you seek is around the bend.

Luz: [drops her pose] Thanks for ruining the mood, Chris.

Nevareth: Go on, Chosen One. The Celestial Staff is yours. You've earned it.

[Luz perks back up and continues down the path.]

Nevareth: Farewell, Lady Luz.

Princess: Farewell. We love you, Chosen One.

[Birds twitter as they fly overhead, casting long shadows below them. Luz looks away from them to focus on the path, before slowing to a stop.]

Luz: [gasps]

[The Celestial Staff stands on a platform in the middle of a lake, illuminated by a ray of light. As Luz approaches the edge of the lake, a glowing comes from the water, followed a few seconds later by a stone walkway rumbling into place, connecting the edge of the lake and the central platform.]

Luz: I knew this world wasn't all gloom and doom like Eda and King said. [skipping and twirling down the walkway] There is wonder here. And I... I think I came here for a reason.

[She pauses as she reaches the platform, staring at the staff in awe.]

Luz: Okay, this is it. Moment of truth.

[She hesitantly grabs the staff. Blue swirls of magic come out of it, creating waves in the lake as the top of the staff glows brightly. She pulls it out of the ground and holds it above her head triumphantly.]

Luz: Yes! I am the Chosen One! I knew it! I always suspected there was a reason nobody understood my wacky antics back at home. [jumps and twirls in a circle, then holds the staff with both hands] Now I have concrete proof. [laughs]

[The staff disintegrates, the dust blowing away in the wind.]

Luz: No!

[She grabs at the dust. Around her, the rest of the illusions fade: flowers at her feet wilt, water drains from the lake and retreats up the riverbanks, and even leaves disappear in a swirl.]

Luz: What?

[Cut to Eda and King flying through the woods on Eda's staff.]

Eda: I know this guy. He's no wizard. He's what you'd call a puppeteer, a demon who specializes in scamming and manipulating people. He's trying to use Luz to get to me.

King: Yeah, and we're flying directly into his trap. Hurray.

Eda: Well, if you can think of a better plan, I'd love to hear it. Hey, faster, you. [slaps her staff]

Owlbert: [hoots]

[Cut to the Celestial Lake, now surrounded in fog. Luz backs up, holding her sword in front of her.]

Luz: [whimpers]

Adegast: [appearing from the fog] Luz, the human.

Luz: Magical wizard?

Adegast: Your hubris has failed you, Witch Apprentice. [cackling]

[Adegast lifts the wizard puppet to reveal an ocotopus-like demon. The ground begins to crack.]

Luz: Huh?

[Her previous travelling companions and cats from the village arise from the stone, a tentacle in each of their backs. They're lifted in the air and surround Luz, who slowly spins around.]

Luz: Okay, Luz. Don't panic. This is classic Chosen One biz. You just have to rescue everybody and defeat the final boss.

Adegast: I am everybody! You fool, don't you see? I'm no wizard. And you're no Chosen One. I've tricked you. [evil laughter]

Luz: What?

[As she's distracted by the reveal, her cape floats up around her. It turns to chains, forcing her to her knees. The bracelets become hand cuffs and the ring becomes chains that lock her hands together, secured with a padlock.]

Luz: No! Betrayed by my own cool accessories. Why are you doing this?

Adegast: Your mentor has been stealing customers from my potions business for years. She must be destroyed.

Luz: Does everybody have a beef with Eda here?

[all agreeing]

Luz: [sighs]

Adegast: And you lured her right into my trap, all because you wanted to think you were special.

Luz: No. Joke's on you, 'cause Eda isn't stupid enough to fall for your trap.

Eda: Adegast!

Luz: Oh, heck!

[Eda and King land at the end of the walkway.]

Adegast: Eda, I have you now!

[Two cat puppets erupt from the ground, one grabbing Eda and the other King.]

Eda: That's right. You have me. Now release Luz.

King: I didn't have to be a part of this!

Adegast: Oh, she can leave. If she wants to. But I sense she wants a real fantasy.

[The Chris puppet breathes a cloud of fog at Luz. When she opens her eyes, she's free of her restraints, kneeling in a dark void. Adegast's puppets walk up to her from the dark.]

Nevareth: Stay with us, Luz. Stay with Adegast. We need you here. You could be our Chosen One.

Princess: Yeah, you can eat our tiny foods forever.

Nevereth: Luz, why would you want to live in a world where people laugh at you?

Luz: It is beautiful here.

Eda: Luz!

Luz: And you guys think I'm special.

Eda: No! [grunts as the tentacle nearly envelops her]

[The puppets all close in on Luz.]

Luz: But it's not real. [grunts and waves the fog away, running forward to pick up her sword] I am a Witch's Apprentice. And I'm gonna earn my magic staff the hard way. I believed you, Magic Man. Now feel my wrath!

[Luz stabs the wizard puppet through the stomach, making it disappear with a poof.]

Adegast: [screams]

[Eda and King free themselves, landing next to Luz with grunts. Luz swings her sword at the princess like it's a bat, making her poof away. Three cat puppets approach Eda. She draws a spell circle, sending a plume of orange smoke at them. They disintegrate with distorted screams.]

Adegast: [screams]

[Nevareth tries to blindside Luz, but his yell alerts her. She catches his sword with her own and duels him.]

Luz: I thought we had a connection, Nevareth! [plunges her sword through his chest]

Nevareth: [grunts] Ah, my flawless pecs! [poofs]

[Eda lands next to Luz, the two sharing a smile.]

Adegast: Back off! [holds up King] Or the dog gets it.

King: I am not a-- [muffled grunt]

[Eda and Luz drop their weapons and raise their hands in surrender.]

Luz: King, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you and never trusted that wizard. You were right. He isn't mystical or magical. He's just a big, slimy jerk.

[She kicks her sword, sending it flying point first into Adegast's head. He screams and drops King, who is caught by Luz. The scream changes pitch as Adegast shrinks to less than an eighth of his previous size. Eda and Luz walk up to him.]

Eda: [picks him up] Well, that's the last time I take an outside referral. [eats him] Mmm. Oh, did you want some of that?

Luz: No. I'm just confused.

Eda: Thinking of calling it quits, huh?

Luz: This place is nothing like I imagined.

Eda: Hmm. Maybe not here. But come with me. I got something to show you.

[Cut to the three of them on Eda's staff, hovering in the sky. Luz is wearing a blindfold.]

Eda: Okay, you can look.

Luz: [takes the blindfold off] Whoa!

[The camera pans to reveal the whole of the Boiling Isles: the decomposing body of a Titan. It's laying with its arms splayed in the sea, its skull illuminated by the setting sun.]

Eda: The bones of the Isles. Up close, the Isles can be slimy--

King: And very stinky.

Eda: And gross. But if you look at it from a different perspective...

[The three of them look to the sky above the Titan's skull, where stars are beginning to appear. As they watch, a shooting star crosses the sky, there for only a moment.]

Luz: It's beautiful.

King: Yeah. [leans against Luz]

Luz: Eda, how did you know that wizard was lying?

Eda: Look, kid, everyone wants to believe they're "chosen". But if we all waited around for a prophecy to make us special, [chuckles] we'd die waiting. And that's why you need to choose yourself.

Luz: Does that mean you'll give me a magic staff of my own?

Eda: Not yet. But... someday.

[Luz leans against Eda as they watch the sun continue to set.]
King: The Boiling Isles, born from the flesh and bones of a fallen Titan. This original magic was so potent, all life on the Isles evolved to wield magic too. For years, we explored those power freely. Until, a mysterious witch appeared who declared that he, and he alone, could speak to the island. He said that we were using magic all wrong. His teachings took hold, his strength grew, and he became... Emperor Belos. Belos said that mixing magic was wrong, that only he had that right. So he created the coven system. And there, our knowledge was restricted, and our potential sealed away. Those who resist are called wild witches, and they face harsh punishment. Emperor Belos has since retreated into his castle. There are whispers that say he's planning something big.

[Cut away from the book to King and Luz in the latter's room.]

King: I wonder if catching Eda was part of his big plan. What do you think, Luz? Luz?

[Luz stares at the tag on her cape, reading: 'To a young witch from her proud mentor EDA']

Luz: I don't care what Belos is up to... because today, I'm saving Eda!

[Cut to Luz opening the door to a room decorated with weapons.]

King: Luz, what are you doing?

Luz: This is serious, King. Eda used her power to save me and got caught by Lilith. Now she's the Owl Beast and is being taken before the Emperor! I don't know what he's planning to do with Eda, but I'm going to rescue her.

King: Haven't you been listening to me? He's the Emperor! He's the most powerful witch alive!

Luz: King, please try to understand. Eda is in this situation because of me. Because of my stupid choice. I have to make up for it.

King: But she's in her Owl Beast form! How will she even recognize you?

Luz: I don't know. But I have to try anyway.

King: Well then, I'm going too.

Luz: King...

King: Me and Eda don't always see eye to eye, but I do consider her family. I want her back as much as you do.

Luz: Alright. Then we've got no time to lose! [runs out of the room]

King: Nyeh!

[King throws the book on the ground, which opens to the page with Belos on it. Cut to Emperor Belos's throne room, focusing on the Titan's beating heart before panning down to the throne.]

Beast Eda: [runs around from Lilith]

Lilith: Eda, stop that this instant!

Beast Eda: [tears down a tapestry of Belos, begins chewing on it]

Lilith: [bubbles Beast Eda] Don't look at me like that. This is for your own good. Emperor Belos will heal you, and we'll be in his coven together. Isn't that wonderful?

Beast Eda: [blows a raspberry at Lilith]

Lilith: I will not fall prey to your childish games. [promptly sticks her tongue out at Eda]

[The door to the throne room opens. Six coven guards and Kikimora enter.]

Kikimora: All kneel before Emperor Belos!

[Kikimora bows and moves away from the door. Lilith kneels. A pair of glowing blue eyes approach from the darkness, eventually revealing Emperor Belos.]

Beast Eda: [shrieks and bursts out of the bubble, running towards Belos]

Lilith: Eda, no!

[Belos vanishes before Beast Eda can attack him, appearing behind her and throwing her against a wall by lifting his finger. Beast Eda falls to the ground, glowing red ropes appearing to keep her down.]

Lilith: [runs between Beast Eda and Belos's shadow] My Lord, I apologize for my sister's rash behavior. She is still in her cursed form. Once you've healed her, as promised, I am sure she will become a useful asset to the coven!

Emperor Belos: [summons his mechanical staff and raises it, healing Eda only to the point of allowing her speech in her Beast form]

Beast Eda: Ah. Where am I? What is this? Aw farts, I got caught.

Emperor Belos: Edalyn Clawthorne, the infamous Owl Lady, the wild witch of Bonesborough. Mentor of Luz the Human.

Beast Eda: You stay away from her, or so help me, Titan....

Emperor Belos: [chuckles] You've got it all wrong. The human is safe, for now. I just want the portal she came through.

Beast Eda: Tough, 'cause I ain't telling you nothing!

Emperor Belos: Ugh, pity. Although I suppose I could ask the human herself.

[Belos snaps his fingers, and the guards run in to drag Eda away.]

Beast Eda: Wait! Don't touch her! Lilith, don't let him hurt her! Lilith!

Lilith: Ah, taking her to the healing ceremony?

Emperor Belos: I will not be healing her.

Lilith: But, you, promised me.

Emperor Belos: Don't be so naïve, Lilith. This is the Titan's will. All wild witches must be dealt with with before the Day of Unity. You understand, don't you?

Lilith: Of course...

Emperor Belos: Good. [begins walking away] Oh, one more thing.

[Belos snaps his fingers, and Owlbert and the bottom half of Eda's staff appear in Lilith's hands.]

Emperor Belos: Destroy the Owl Lady's staff. She won't be needing it anymore.

[Belos leaves the throne room, leaving Lilith staring after him. The doors close. Cut to a news broadcast on a crystal ball.]

Perry Porter: Perry Porter coming to you live from outside the Emperor's Castle. Edalyn Clawthorne, known commonly as "Eda the Owl Lady," has been captured and has been brought before the Emperor.

Kikimora: For the crime of attacking a coven leader and refusing to join a coven, Edalyn Clawthorne's body shall be petrified in stone! Today, sundown, at the Conformatorium.

Gus: [gasps and turns to his scroll] Willow! Are you watching?

Willow: Yes. We have to do something.

Perry: Today is a grave day for Bonesborough.

[Various demons and witches watching the crystal balls in the street murmur in discussion and walk off, revealing Luz and King.]

Luz: Please tell me that's not as bad as it sounds.

King: Petrification is only done to the worst criminals, and once the spell is complete, it can't be reversed.

[The newscast shows several petrified witches in what looks like a graveyard before fading to a picture of Lilith.]

Luz: Lilith. She cursed Eda. She captured her own sister! She is the worst! If I ever see her again!

[Luz tosses the crystal ball displaying the news onto the ground, shattering it.]

King: Luz, calm down. We need to think about saving Eda first!

Luz: [sighs] You're right, but how will we get to the Conformatorium in time?

[A guard walks by, whistling. King narrows his eyes while looking at the guard.]

King; We'll have to do something so diabolical, so criminally insane, that they'll have to send us to the Conformatorium.

Luz: Hey!

Guard: Hm?

[Luz and King are standing on grass, directly in front of a DO NOT STEP ON GRASS sign.]

Luz & King: Whaaa?

Guard: [gasps]

Luz: Yep.

[Doors close, securing Luz and King in a paddy wagon.]

Luz: Perfect plan.

[Cut to the sign for the Conformatorium. The paddy wagon passes by petrified wild witches, which Luz and King stare at.]

Luz & King: [gasp]

[Two guards bring out a pedestal with Eda's name on it.]

King: There's not gonna be a new statue going up today. Right, Luz? Luz?

[The wagon passes a poster of Lilith.]

Luz: [growls]

[The paddy wagon continues on, entering the Conformatorium proper. A gate closes behind it, and the camera pans up to reveal a banner reading 'PETRIFICATION TODAY AT SUNDOWN'. Cut to inside, where the paddy wagon backs in to a docking station.]

Guard: Sir, the Owl Lady's human student has been apprehended.

Warden Wrath: Very good. Ah, Luz the Human. How I've waited to see you again. Now I'll have my revenge and you'll have front row seats to Eda's demise.

[Wrath opens the paddy wagon doors and is bombarded by branches.]

Warden Wrath: [screams]

Emperor's Coven Guard: Huh?

Luz: [screams and slams an ice glyph on the ground]

[A spear of ice pins the Emperor's Guard to the ceiling. Wrath shoves away the branches, then is captured by several ice pillars. Luz walks up to him with King on her shoulder.]

Luz: Where's Eda?

Warden Wrath: She's in the holding cell in the dungeon.

Luz: Draw me a map!

[Cut to outside, where an audience is gathered.]

Member 1: Do you really think Eda deserves a petrification?

Member 2: I don't know. This is all happening so fast.

Willow: If we know anything about Luz, she's going to be here trying to save Eda.

Gus: And we'll be here to save her when she needs us!

Willow: Let's split up and find her!

[Zoom out to see Lilith watching the crowd from a window.]

Kikimora: Fools! You let the human escape! And you drew her a map?

Lilith: Worry not, Kikimora. I shall capture the human.

[Cut to a hallway, where two guards are hanging in vines from the ceiling, another can only be seen by his legs, a fourth is holding his hands in front of a fire, and a fifth is encased in ice. Luz walks away from the scene, running to a padlocked set of double doors.]

Luz: King, watch the door.

King: Weh.

[Luz steps forward and places an ice glyph on the lock, freezing and breaking it. She enters the room and pulls out a light glyph.]

Beast Eda: [growling off screen]

Luz: Eda? Eda!

[Luz runs to her, but bounces off when her wing twitches. Beast Eda turns at the noise and growls, going in for the attack]

Luz: [pulls out an activated light glyph] Eda, wait! It's me! It's me.

Beast Eda: [closes her eyes, reopens them to reveal them being gold again] Luz? Oh no, oh no no no no no wh- what are you doing here?

Luz: It's okay Eda, I'm here to save you.

[She activates a fire glyph on the chain keeping Eda in place, but the flame does nothing.]

Beast Eda: Your magic isn't strong enough for this. You need to leave! Now.

Luz: But, but I can't! It's my fault you needed to save me. It's my fault you got captured.

Beast Eda: No. Listen to me. I'm here because of my own actions. I went against Belos's law, and for a while I was able to get away with it. But, [sighs] well without magic, I can't do much. I don't regret anything. I lived freely and... I got to meet you.

Luz: Eda...

Beast Eda: But if you stay here, I won't be able to protect you. You need to leave. Now!

Luz: But we're a family! Us weirdos have to stick together, remember?

[Eda sticks a claw into her hair, pulling out the key for the portal door. She activates it, making the door rise from the floor. It opens as she speaks, revealing the same path that Luz chased Owlbert down at the beginning of the summer.]

Beast Eda: You have a family already. Go back to them. And when you're home, use your fire magic to destroy the portal door. [places the key around Luz's neck] I don't know why Belos wants it, but we can't take any chances.

Luz: [looks at Eda with tears in her eyes before tucking the key under her cloak and hugging her] I love you, Eda.

Beast Eda: I love you too, kiddo.

[A siren blares as a door in the ceiling opens.]

Beast Eda: Luz, get away!

[Eda pushes Luz away as the chain around her neck glows blue and transforms into a cage. The ground beneath Eda begins to rise.]

Luz: No! [runs forward and grabs a hold of the bottom of Eda's claw] Not yet!

Beast Eda: I'm sorry. [pushes Luz off] Goodbye, Luz.

Luz: Eda!

[The platform completely rises into the ceiling with an air of finality. Luz cries into her hand, kneeling between the door to the human realm and where Eda had been just moments before. Cut to the door as it opens suddenly.]

Lilith: Drat!

King: Let me go!

Lilith: I'm too late, at least I found you, human.

Luz: You. You hurt Eda. You put her in chains. And now, I will take you down! [yells as she jumps at Lilith, activating spell cards]

Lilith: [drops King to block Luz's spell with her staff] I just wanna talk!

Luz: Talk to the glyph, witch!

[Luz slams five plant glyphs to the ground at once, summoning several tendrils to trap Lilith. She breaks through them easily with a spin of her staff, but Luz uses the distraction to jump onto Lilith.]

Lilith: Ah, stop! What is wrong with you?

[The two walk through the still-open portal door.]

King: Luz! [follows them through the door]

[Luz and Lilith fall off the porch of the house in the human realm. King follows through a second later. Luz is the first to recover, looking at the forest they landed in as the wind blows her cloak and hair. Lilith stands behind her with her hands glowing blue.]

King: Luz, watch out! [is pulled to the ground by vines]

Luz: [dives out of the way of Lilith's spell and pulls a fire glyph out] Fire! [the glyph disintegrates in her hands] What?

Lilith: [tackles Luz] Please, just listen to me!

Luz: No way! You deserve to be petrified! Not Eda!

Lilith: You're right. [backs away from Luz] I deserve to be in Edalyn's place.

Luz: Why did you do all this?

Lilith: When Edalyn and I were younger, we were, the best of friends.

[Cut to flashback of a young Lilith and Eda, wearing Potions-track Hexside uniforms, running through the woods while laughing. Young Eda trips, then sits up to reveal her knee bleeding. She starts crying. Young Lilith turns around and kneels in front of her, cupping Eda's face to wipe her tears before putting their foreheads together.]

Young Lilith: With this spell declared, let the pain be shared.

[Half of Eda's wound transfers to Lilith's knee. She winces, but both of them grin. Cut to a teenage Eda and Lilith practicing duels with a mop and a broom respectively.]

Lilith: [voiceover] Being in the Emperor's Coven was my dream. I wanted to work alongside the most powerful witch on the Isles and make the world a better place.

[Eda spins the mop easily, while Lilith whacks herself in the head with her broom.]

Lilith: [voiceover] Eda wanted to be with me, but there was a problem.

[Cut to the Hexside Grudgby pitch, where a field day is being held. Teen Eda and Lilith are standing in front of the Emperor's Coven stand.]

Emperor's coven delegate: One spot is available. You duel tomorrow. The winner will join our ranks.

Lilith: [voiceover] I knew Edalyn would beat me. She was younger, but worked twice as hard. She met me at my level.

[Teen Lilith walks away from the stand while Eda reaches out to her. Cut to Teen Lilith wearing a cloak and walking through the Night Market.]

Lilith: [voiceover] Emperor Belos always said, "To be great, you have to make sacrifices." What would he do in my situation? I found a spell that would take away her powers.

[Teen Lilith looks at a scroll with an owl seal on it. Her face goes from nervous to determined, and breaks the seal. A bright red light comes from the scroll, taking over the screen. Cut to a door opening to Eda's room as she sleeps. An indistinct, shadowy figure becomes Lilith as she steps forward and pulls down the hood of her cloak. She approaches Eda's bed, holding out the cursed scroll. It glows red again, reflecting in Lilith's glasses ominously.]

Lilith: [voiceover] I thought it would just be for a day.

[Cut to the Hexside Grudgby pitch again. This time the stands are packed, and Teen Eda and Lilith stand opposite each other. They each raise an arm in a dueling pose, before Lilith runs forward with a yell, a blue flame appearing in her hand. Eda watches her approach.]

Teen Eda: No!

[Teen Lilith skids to a halt, the flame on her hand dying out. She looks surprised.]

Teen Eda: I refuse to battle my sister. [walks up to a shell-shocked Lilith] I've decided that covens aren't really my style. Hey, don't forget me when you're a big shot, sis.

Lilith: [voiceover] And as Edalyn walked away...

[Teen Eda barely makes it to the edge of the Grudgby pitch before she starts yelling in pain and falls to her hands and knees. Feathers burst from her hand and race up her arm, tearing the seam of her uniform. Brown wings sprout from her back, her ears grow as she covers her face with claws, until she screams in a voice part-witch and part-beast, her eyes pitch black. The newly transformed Owl Beast looks at the crowd, looks at Lilith, terrified.]

Crowd: [yells and jeers]

Crowd Member: What is that?!

Crowd Member 2: That girl is a monster!

[A rock hits Beast Eda's forehead. Emperor's Coven members continue to throw rocks at her as the crowd boos, until Beast Eda flares her wings and snarls at them.]

Crowd Member 3: Get out! GO!

[Beast Eda does just that, turning tail and running away.]

Teen Lilith: Edalyn!

Emperor Belos Delegate: [grabs Lilith's arm] Lilith Clawthrone, we welcome you to the Emperor's coven!

[He holds Teen Lilith's arm up in triumph as the crowd cheers.]

Lilith: [voiceover] I made my sacrifice for the emperor, and it was time to receive my reward.

[Cut to present day]

Lilith: I've been pursuing Edalyn because if she joined the Emperor's coven, Emperor Belos told me he would heal her curse. But he lied to me. I know how to rescue Edalyn, but I can't do it alone.

Luz: How do I know I can trust you?

[Lilith appears to think for a second before tracing a large spell circle. Owlbert and the rest of Eda's staff appear in her hands. She holds them both out to Luz, who takes them]

Luz: Owlbert! You're okay.

[Owlbert opens his eyes and coos, nuzzling into Luz. She puts him on her shoulder and uses the staff to stand.]

Luz: All right, Lilith. I don't like your whole, [she points at Lilith and traces a circle with her finger] deal, but... [her expression softens] we need your help to save Eda.

[Luz holds out the door key as Lilith stands.]

Lilith: Thank you.

[The vines around King loosen and let's him go.]

King: Weh?

Lilith: Now, lets head back.

[Lilith heads for the door. Luz starts to follow her, but a breeze makes her look back at the human realm behind them. A nostalgic, mournful tune plays as she stares at the trees. Lilith walks through the door, but King notices Luz lingering.]

King: Hey Luz, You...need a minute?

Luz: No. I'm coming.

[She walks up the steps as King follows Lilith. Luz pauses just before entering, taking one last look at the human realm, before disappearing in the glowing white. The glow disappears with her, leaving just a broken down house with a closed door.]

[Cut to an Emperor's Coven guard drumming a beat. Zoom out to reveal several drumming guards in two lines in front of a large crowd.]

Willow: I don't see Luz anywhere

Gus: Do you think she got caught?

[An alarm sounds, and the cage with Beast Eda in it rises onto a towering platform in front of the crowd.]

Perry Porter: Well folks, Eda the Owl Lady has appeared on stage, which means the petrification process is about to begin.

[Kikimora finishes rising with the cage. She walks forward and pushes a lever, making the three headed statue rise from the ground. Beast Eda visibly looks nervous as the machine crackles to power. Cut to the inside of the Conformatorium, where Lilith, Luz, and King are passing by towering statues covered in what appear to be meaty tendrils. They stop in front of a small platform.]

Lilith: You can take this up to the stage where they're holding Edalyn.

Luz: Thank you, Lilith. What will you do now?

Lilith: I will stay in the Emperor's coven, but I will make sure nothing like this ever happen again.

Luz: That's good to hear. [looks around] Wait, why are there no guards around?

[A red tendril wraps itself around Lilith's legs, pulling her down.]

Lilith: [screams]

Luz: Lilith!

King: [screams as he also gets taken by a tendril]

Luz: King!

[Lilith and King are dragged up near the ceiling before being suspended on either side of the far wall. Fires ignite below them, flanking a skull-like throne that Belos is sitting in, his staff in hand.]

Emperor Belos: Ah, Lilith. You chose the wrong side.

[Lilith and King are pulled upwards. Luz stares in horror and tries to walk forward, but two arms grab her legs.]

Luz: No!

Emperor Belos: Ah puh-puh. I'd actually like to have a word with you, human.

[Luz glares at Belos.]

[Cut to Lilith and King being forced into Beast Eda's cage by two Emperor's Coven members. They both land, kneeling, as the bars close behind them.]

Lilith: [looks up] Hello, Edalyn.

Beast Eda: [glares for several seconds] Lilith. [begins pacing] You hurt Luz. You cursed me. Before anything turns me to stone, I'll tear you apart. [raises her claw.]

King: [jumps between Eda and Lilith] No, don't!

Eda: [gasps]

King: She was trying to help. She even betrayed the Emperor for you!

Beast Eda: What?

Lilith: If I knew something like this would happen, Edalyn, I--

[Lilith tries to cup Eda's face, but the activation of the petrification machine earns both of their attentions. The machine's eyes begin to glow, first yellow, then green. Cut to the crowd.]

Willow & Gus: [gasp]

Willow: We gotta do something.

Perry Porter: And in a shocking turn of events, head Coven leader Lilith is now in the holding cage. Escorted by what appears to be a deranged cat.

[Gus pulls on his sleeve.]

Perry Porter: Augustus? I'm live!

Gus: Dad, you have to stop!

Willow: [grabs Perry's microphone] Yeah. What's happening to Eda isn't right. She might not always follow the rules, but she hasn't done anything worthy of a petrification!

Eye-Eating Prisoner: She helped me escape jail.

Morton: She helps me stay in business!

Principal Bump: She helped me love teaching again... after she left.

Willow: The Emperor should let Eda go.

Gus: Let Eda go!

Crowd: [chanting] Let Eda go! Let Eda go! Let Eda go! Let Eda go!

[Camera pans down to the chamber with Luz and Belos.]

Luz: Let my friends go, or else!

Owlbert: [hoot]

[Luz slams the butt of Eda's staff into the floor, rocketing out of the grip of the hands holding her down. She lands with a flip and slams the staff down, summoning a row of ice spikes that stops inches away from Belos's mask.]

Emperor Belos: Okay. [melts from the throne, reappearing behind Luz, appearing to be more liquid than solid mass] I'll play.

[Belos lifts a finger and flicks it, sending Luz into the base of a towering statue. A crack travels up the statue, until it frees the giant two-headed axe, which Luz just barely dodges.]

[Luz sends a fireblast at spikes of earth. She freezes a giant red hand in a block of ice. She mounts the staff to avoid more earth spikes. She pulls the staff around and aims for Belos, fire glyphs in hand.]

[Belos stands immobile as the intro monster appears around him.]

Luz: [screams]

[The intro monster swallows Luz. It explodes a second later, and Luz lands on the ground on her feet.]

Emperor Belos: [screen pulsing with his words] What's wrong, human? I thought you wanted to fight.

[The shadow of Belos passes, and Luz turns to face it. More arms grab her legs and arms, pulling her back down to the ground.]

Luz: Huh? Ah!

Emperor Belos: [appearing from the shadows] Had enough?

Luz: [smirks] Not even close. [moves her hand to reveal an ice glyph]

[The ice pillar hits Belos's mask, chipping a piece off. Luz looks at the shard before looking back up at Belos.]

Emperor Belos: [chuckles] I like your spirit. [turns around to reveal a glowing blue eye shining out of the broken half of his mask] But try that again and things won't end well for you.

[The arms retreat off of Luz.]

Emperor Belos: Now I'm just a humble messenger for the Titan. In the grand scheme of things, the Owl Lady's life is inconsequential. [steps directly in front of Luz] But then you showed up. If you want to save your mentor, give me the portal to the human realm.

Luz: But... my home.

[Luz looks up. Cut to the petrification machine, which is completely powered on. A bolt of green energy directs itself to the cage.]

Beast Eda, King, and Lilith: [scream]

[Beast Eda dives in front of Lilith and King, taking the full brunt of the blast of magic.]

Lilith: Edalyn!

Beast Eda: [screams, more beast than Eda]

[Cut back to Belos and Luz.]

Emperor Belos: You probably think we want to invade the human realm, but the Titan's will is not so boarish. You'll understand soon. Tick tock, human. The Owl Lady doesn't have much time left.

Beast Eda: [distantly screeches]

Luz: [reaches for the ceiling, for Eda] No! [grabs the clasp of her cloak as a tear runs down her cheek] Fine! [reaches under her cloak and activates the portal door, keeping the key out of sight of Belos. She hugs the door to her chest.] Lo siento, mamá. [grabs Eda's staff and stands, reluctantly walking towards Belos and holding out the door] Here, it's yours.

Emperor Belos: The Titan will be pleased.

[Belos takes the door. Luz's hand lingers on it, not dropping until a few seconds after it's completely out of her grasp. She finally steps on the platform that Lilith had brought her to, pulling the hood of the cloak up.]

Emperor Belos: Go on then. [He taps his staff against the ground, making the platform rise] Go be a hero.

Luz: I may have lost, but so have you.

[Luz turns around and taps Eda's staff against the platform. Owlbert's eyes glow, as do the fire glyphs on the door before the latter ignite, making the portal to the human realm explode. Belos backs away from the flaming eye, the only substantial part of the door that remains. He glares at Luz through the smoke, who glares right back as the platform carries her out of the chamber.]

[Cut to Beast Eda, whose legs begin turning to stone. Luz and the platform rise in between the cage and the petrification machine. Luz grabs a plant glyph and throws it to the base of the machine. Vines burst out of the glyph and rock the machine to the side, stopping it.]

Beast Eda: [screeches and falls to the ground, nearly completely stone]

King: Wh-- what do we do?!

Lilith: The spell wasn't completed! Maybe I can help her fight it! [puts her hands on Eda's wing]

Kikimora: No! What is happening?

Luz: [activates a fire glyph as she walks behind Kikimora] Free them, now!

[Kikimora shrinks in on herself and traces a spell circle. The cage disappears, and Luz runs to Eda.]

Luz: Eda! Are you okay?

[The stone recedes from Eda's body. Her eyes open.]

Beast Eda: As good as I'll ever be.

[Emperor's Coven guards, holding spears, close in on them. Luz prepares herself for a fight, but Eda flings her and King onto her back.]

Beast Eda: Let's fly.

[Lilith gets on in front of Luz and King, and Eda takes off. The Coven guards take aim with their spears, but none hit them. The crowd cheers as Eda flies away. Cut to Kikimora glaring after them, until Emperor Belos walks out, his mask still broken.]

Kikimora: My liege.

Emperor Belos: [walks to the edge of the roof] Children of the Isles. The Titan has told me to spare the Owl Lady's life, but in return, her curse will strip away all her powers. Let her monstrous form be a lesson about the dangers of wild magic.

[Cut to the Owl House, which Beast Eda lands in front of, panting heavily. Luz, Lilith, and King dismount.]

Luz: Don't worry, Eda. I'll run and get you some elixir and--

Lilith: No, human. No amount of elixir can heal her now. Oh, sister. [cups Eda's face] I should have done this a long time ago. [puts their foreheads together] With this spell declared, let the pain be shared.

[Lilith and Beast Eda glow blue and float. Their gems glow, and Eda returns back to her usual witch form. Luz shields King from the light, and they both turn when it fades to see Eda, back to normal, and Lilith land softly.]

Luz: Eda!

[Lilith and Eda turn their heads to reveal that one of each of their eyes has turned gray, and Lilith now has a streak of gray hair while Eda has a streak of white and her gem is still black. Eda laughs as Luz and King run and hug her.]

Luz: Can you still do magic?

Eda: [traces a spell circle, which disintegrates] That's a no. It'll take some time to get used to this.

Lilith: I feel that I've been weakened as well.

Luz: It's okay. I can teach you what I know, and what we don't know, we can learn together.

[Luz puts a light glyph in Eda's hand. Eda activates it, looking shocked that it worked. The ball of light floats into the night sky. Lilith walks closer to the others.]

Eda: [ruffling Luz's hair] Thanks, kid. [pulls Luz into a hug] I look forward to that.

[Camera focuses on the ball of light, which rises until it gets lost among the stars.]

Luz: [voiceover] And that's how we escaped from the Emperor.

[Cut to Luz's room, where she's laying on her stomach in her sleeping bag. King is asleep at her feet.]

Luz: Everyone told me he was the most powerful witch alive.

[Cut to the view of Luz's phone, where she's recording a video.]

Luz: But look at this, Mom. [holds up the chip of Belos's mask] I chipped off a piece of his mask! I know he's not invincible now. [her expression falls] It's a strange feeling, having gone through so much and, not having you here to share it with. And I don't know when or how I'm gonna see you again. [puts her phone down and looks at a picture of her and Camila, then at the ball of light hovering in front of her] But I will find my way home to you. I promise. Deja una luz puesta para mí. Te quiero.

[Luz pokes the ball of light, putting it out. Several balls of light hovering outside of her window float away when it goes dark. Cut to a staircase in the Emperor's Castle, which Belos is standing in front of and Kikimora is walking down.]

Kikimora: Sire, those miscreants are still at large. Please, allow me to capture them.

Emperor Belos: Worry not, Kiki. We'll be keeping an eye on the inhabitants of the Owl House.

[Belos nods to a robed figure wearing a mask that resembles an owl. They nod back before walking away.]

Emperor Belos: In the meantime, the Day of Unity is almost upon us...

[Belos turns, and the camera moves to reveal a round white frame with wings attached to it, partially built. Inside the frame is the portal door, still broken, but being pieced back together.]

Emperor Belos: ...and we have much work to do.
