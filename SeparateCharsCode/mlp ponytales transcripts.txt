==All Bottled Up==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:'''Applejack''': What's goin' on, Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I had a notion this fridge full of potion needed cleaning.
:[doorbell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] That must be my new cupcake toppings! B.R.B.!
:[zip!]
:[clatter]
:[splash]
:[shimmer]
:'''Applejack''': Hey, Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Applejack''': Whatcha doin'?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, nothing. Certainly not avoiding any specific pet in particular.
:'''Applejack''': Who?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So you've heard.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [voiceover] Owlowiscious and I got into a fight, and now we're not talking.

:'''Applejack''': You want to talk about it... with me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, look! Cookies! And not talking about my problems! [chomps]
:'''Applejack''': Hold up now. What if you—? [gags]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': See?
:'''Applejack''': [gulps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tastes soooo gooooo— [yelps]
:[whoosh!]
:[shimmer]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yaaaah! Phew!
:'''Applejack''': Aah! Oof!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Goodness gracious, where are we?
:'''Applejack''': We're trapped in the potion bottle! [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're trapped in the potion bottle!
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know how this happened, but I seem to have escaped my problems ''and'' I get to hang out with one of my best friends? ''This is perfect!''
:'''Applejack''': Uh, it's anythin' ''but'' perfect. It's ''im''perfect! Worse, it's ''non''-perfect! I have claustrophobia! [to fourth wall] It means I hate bein' in confined spaces. You know, like potion bottles? One of these doors must lead back out to the real world!
:[doors opening and closing]
:'''Applejack''': [whimpering] It's just a process of elimination! [groans] We're trapped!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, fiddlesticks.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight? Applejack? Where the fridge are they? Not in the cupboard. Huh. Not in the ceiling. They certainly couldn't be in here.

:'''Applejack''': We're in here! Help us! Hey, Twi! Help a pony out! Shout with me!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [unenthused] Help us. Pleeeease.

:'''Rarity''': Pinkie-poo-pancake, did you lose something in that potion bottle?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um... [gasps] I think Twilight and Applejack are somehow stuck in here!
:'''Rarity''': Good heavens! How will we ever get them out?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Magic has trapped them, so we need to go to the potion source. We're coming ova, Potion Nova!
:[zip!]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Applejack''': [yelling]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting]

:'''Applejack''': I reckon I'm gettin'— [gags]— potion motion sickness.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not so bad. It's like we're on a fun hayride.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Potion Nova, we need your help! Twilight and Applejack are trapped inside this potion bottle!
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh. [sniffs] Ah. How about that? What you're gonna need is a super strong antidote potion. An antido-tion!
:'''Rarity''': Ooh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh!
:'''Rarity''': Wow!
:[liquid pouring]
:[poof!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:[pop]
:[liquid pouring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here comes Potion Nova's antidote!

:'''Applejack''': Huh? We're saved! Whoa!

:'''Applejack''': Yee-haw! I'm free!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait. Where's Twilight?
:'''Potion Nova''': Hmm. That should've done the trick. Unless...

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting] Must... stay... bottled! Whoo-hoo! [grunts]

:'''Potion Nova''': Twilight's desire to stay inside is strong enough to overpower the potion.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Applejack, do you have any idea what her reason could be?
:'''Applejack''': I do. And I'm goin' back in.
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': [chomps]
:[whoosh!]

:'''Applejack''': Whoa! Ugh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh? Why are you back? I thought you were afraid of being trapped.
:'''Applejack''': I am! I'm terrified! But you're my friend, and whether you know it or not, you need me right now.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, I don't. I'm fine being trapped. I'm not bottling up my problems. In fact, I left them outside the bottle and bottled up myself!
:'''Applejack''': It's hard, but I confronted my problem head-on. And it felt great! I don't know what you and Owlowiscious fought about. I betcha it doesn't even matter. What matters is that you two are friends. Like you and I are friends. And—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And friends can solve any problem together.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] You're darn tootin' they can!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm ready to go now.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Applejack''': [slurp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Applejack''': [yell]

:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:'''Potion Nova''': Bit of a bottle episode you had, huh?
:[thunder]

==All That Jitters==
: '''Twilight Sparkle''': Hello there, Potion Nova! Nope. Too casual. Helloooo, Miss Nova! Psyched for my first day as your potion-prentice! Hmm. I don't know how she feels about puns. Maybe... Reporting for duty, potion master! Yeah. That'll work. Let's do this thing.
:[door jiggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... [grunting, sighs, yelps] Phew!
:[stomach rumbles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] Butterflies in your tum? Okay. Let's do this thing.
:'''Potion Nova''': [snoring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering] Excuse me. Potion Nova? Reporting for duty, potion master?
:'''Potion Nova''': [snoring]
:[squeak]
:'''Potion Nova''': [yells]
:[boing]
:[thud]
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh. [laughs] You're here early.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'm just excited to be your apprentice. And a little nervous. But mostly excited! [giggles]
:'''Potion Nova''': Well, it's time to get started.
:[zip!]
:'''Potion Nova''': Welcome to my "Pon Appetit" test kitchen!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': She ''does'' like puns!

:[bubbling]
:'''Potion Nova''': Here we have a stew simmering.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Magical.
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh, and this bread is rising.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Truly amazing.
:'''Potion Nova''': They have nothing to do with magic, but, you know, they're fun.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, pffft! Of course! [giggles] Now this must be a super magical artifact!
:'''Potion Nova''': That's a can opener.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! Yes! Just a silly joke! Of course I know it's a can opener! [laughs nervously]
:[clatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:'''Potion Nova''': All right. You doing okay, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fine! Just fine! Perfect! Never better! [under breath] This is not going as planned. Got to get these nerves under control.
:'''Potion Nova''': Let's get started with some basic potion-making.

:[liquid pouring]
:[boom!]
:'''Potion Nova''': [giggles]

:[shaking]
:[liquid pouring]
:[crack!]
:[fizzle]
:[mole squeaking]

:'''Potion Nova''': I think this might be a good time to take five.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:[shatter!]

:'''Potion Nova''': Seems like you're having a hard time today. Is something wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! I'm fine! Let's keep making potions! Practice makes passable! I mean potion! I mean perfect!
:'''Potion Nova''': Twi! How are you ''really'' feeling?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well... [quickly] I was just so nervous on my first day and wanted to impress you! But I keep making stupid mistakes and now I can't stop, even though I knoooow I'm smarter than this and you're probably gonna think that I'm dumb and bad at potions forever! ''I'VE RUINED MAGIC!''
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoa. I didn't even know I was feeling all that.
:'''Potion Nova''': No wonder you shattered into a million pieces. You've got to take it easy on yourself and let go of those nerves and frustration.
:[zip!]
:'''Potion Nova''': How about putting all that emotion into the potion rather than bottling it up inside? You've got to put your essence<!--?--> into it. That's when the potion's done. That we can bottle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think I can try that.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] ''I! AM SO! FRUSTRATED! RIGHT NOW!''
:[drip]
:[splash]
:[bubbling]
:'''Potion Nova''': See? Letting your frustration out is working!
:[bubbling]
:[zoom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How in Equestria did ''that'' happen? [whimpering] I added my real emotions!
:'''Potion Nova''': That's just potions, baby. You put in real, honest feelings, and magic still does whatever it wants. It's unpredictable. Just like us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah. Do you think it's done?
:[fizzling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Potion Nova''': Aah!
:'''Potion Nova''': We'll just give it a minute to settle.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Potion Nova''': Great work, Twilight. I can tell you're really putting everything you got into these potions.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's just such an honor to learn from the master.
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh, shucks, it's nothing!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, really. That's why I was so nervous to make a great first impression.
:'''Potion Nova''': Are you kidding me? I've never had an apprentice as smart as you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aw, you've got to be pulling my hoof! You are so smart! The way you sneak in to stock the fridge...
:[poof!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Genius!
:[beeping]
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh! That's the bread.
:[zip!]
:'''Potion Nova''': [sniffs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''And'' you're an amazing cook! Is there anything this pony can't do?! Oof!
:'''Potion Nova''': Dance. I'm awful. Four left hooves. [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Potion Nova''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You ''are'' a bad dancer!
:'''Potion Nova''': [laughs] I really, really am!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Potion Nova''': [laughing]

==Part 1==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Just smell the morning air, Gummy. [deep sniff]
:'''Gummy''': [sniffs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So peaceful. So serene. It's like nothing bad in the whole world could ever—
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah!
:[door closes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': If this is another croissant caper, don't think you'll out-muscle me again! ''I know your tricks!''
:'''Rarity''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, Rarity!
:'''Rarity''': Pinkie! Help! Something horrid has happened!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''Who did what?! Let me at' em! LET ME AT 'EM!''
:'''Rarity''': It's almost too awful to say.
:[crash!]
:[door closes]
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Ponyville's primary pony of propriety, Fancy Pants, has asked ''me'' to go for a stroll in the park!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um, and this is bad because... you don't want to go?
:'''Rarity''': Worse! I ''do'' want to go!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! That ''is'' awful! Wait. Why is that awful?
:'''Rarity''': "Why?", she asks. Why?! [laughs] Here's why.
:[squeak]
:[whoosh]

:[shatter]
:'''Rarity''': [narrating] Yesterday, I was only slightly flaunting my new headband while putting a subtle fine touch on my garden, when suddenly...
:'''Fancy Pants''': Ah! My mirror!
:'''Rarity''': Fancy Pants!
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, how will I ever find such another lovely face to—? [gasps]
:[romantic music]
:'''Rarity''': Oh! Didn't see you there. I was just casually having some potion my friend Pinkie gave me. [laughs nervously] Uh, would you like a sip?
:'''Fancy Pants''': No. I would ''love'' one!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Fancy Pants''': Would you like to go for a stroll in the park with me tomorrow eve?
:'''Rarity''': No. I would ''love'' to!
:'''Fancy Pants''': Ah! Then I'll see you tomorrow night!
:[shatter]
:'''Rarity''': Ugh!
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, it seems your endearing clumsiness has resulted in a bad omen.
:'''Rarity''': Bad omen?
:'''Fancy Pants''': Well, you know what they say. Bad things happen in threes. Hopefully, our stroll won't be bad thing number three, eh? [laughs]
:'''Rarity''': [forced laughter] Yes! Terribly funny! How truly horrific! All right, Rarity. One bad thing happened. Nothing to worry about. [laughs nervously] Now, a second bad thing were to happen, and I'd really have to— Whoa! Oof!

:[pounding]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. [laughs] Okay.
:'''Rarity''': My headband got covered in potion, Pinkie Pie. Now it won't stop revealing deep, dark truths to me.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh. Wow.
:'''Inner Pinkie Pie''': [clears throat] Pinkie Pie. Sprinkles cannot fix every problem.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was horrible!
:'''Rarity''': So, you can see why bad thing number three absolutely must happen before my rendezvous with Fancy Pants.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait, what?
:'''Rarity''': If it happens before the rendezvous, it won't happen ''at'' the rendezvous.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That logic seems a little extreme.
:[loud banging]
:'''Rarity''': Ooooh! This is it!
:[crash!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Door was jammed. [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': [growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] So cute!

:'''Fluttershy''': Huh?
:'''Inner Fluttershy''': You speak softly, yet you carry within you the most wondrous and terrifying force of all.

:'''Rarity''': Well? Was it bad?
:'''Fluttershy''': No. Nothing I didn't already know.
:'''Gummy''': [croaks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's just store this in the pantry for now, huh?
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh. You go for it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, you.
:'''Rarity''': Please don't fight! What's that? Your friendship is totally destroyed? Over such a silly misunderstanding? I never thought such a bad thing could happen! Ah, well. What can you do?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, Rarity, we're not in a fight.
:[chomp]
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''': What's tuggin' your tail, Rarity?
:'''Rarity''': Bad things happen in threes. And darling, I'm on strike three.
:[hiss]
:'''Applejack''': Don't you think it's just a bit of superstition? There's no logical reason that... Okay. She's walkin' away.
:'''Rarity''': That's it! This calls for more drastic action! Sabotage!

:'''Rarity''': [to herself] You impress me yet again, Rarity, you saucy sassy girl with a mane that won't quit. [to herself] Oh, so sweet. Thank you.

:'''Applejack''': Yikes.

==Part 2==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Souffle week of the Royal Jelly Juggernaut is notoriously difficult. But with this recipe, I know I can pull it off.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Noice! Huh? Mm.
:'''Rarity''': [deep, gravelly voice] Must make the bad thing happen!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [reading incoherently]
:'''Rarity''': [deep, gravelly voice] If Pinkie Pie's recipe were to suddenly disappear... that would be a bad thing. [normal voice] [gasps] But I can't take Pinkie's recipe. She needs it to compete. [deep, gravelly voice] Not until next weekend. You can get it back to her by then. She will never be the wiser. Plus, you can make it up to her later. [normal voice] Hmm. All right. You do make a good point. [deep, gravelly voice] That was... easier than I expected. [normal voice] [gasps] Ah! So it's come to this! Come at me with your worst!
:'''Gummy''': [growls]
:'''Rarity''': [yells] Take this!
:[thud]
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Hah!
:'''Gummy''': [croaking]
:'''Rarity''': [laughs, gasps] Ugh! [grunting] So... strong! Sweet victory! [yelling] Ugh. Huh? Not like this! [wails]

:'''Rarity''': [wails] Okay, too late. I'm here. Ominous, sure, but her eyeshadow's stunning! Bravo!
:'''Inner Rarity''': Rarity, bad thing number three will not happen at the park.
:'''Rarity''': Really? Then it was all worth it.
:'''Inner Rarity''': Because it has already happened. You are trapped here with me.
:[clang!]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Inner Rarity''': Bad things do not happen in threes, but you sealed your own fate by focusing on the negative rather than living in the present.
:'''Rarity''': Okay, yes. Profound. Whatever. But seeing as I've already learned my lesson now, can't I still go to the park?
:'''Inner Rarity''': No. [laughs] While mere seconds have passed for you and I, the outside world has aged eons! [laughs]
:'''Rarity''': [screams]

:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [hyperventilates]
:'''Applejack''': [gasps]

:'''Inner Rarity''': W-W-W-W-Wait. So I lied about this one thing. But nopony ever hangs out with me here! Oh. [scoffs] Where's my phone?

:'''Rarity''': Oh, Applejack! Twilight! And even young Pinkie! You're all here! How long was I gone? A week? A century?! Oh, what a foolish filly I have been. I suppose Fancy Pants has strolled on with another pony. Good. He deserves to be happy!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Rarity? You were gone for thirty-five seconds.
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, Rarity! Stroll time! Trot-trot!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Trot-trot"?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': See? He's here!
:'''Rarity''': B-B-But—!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': But bad thing number three!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You can't control it. Just go with the flow.
:'''Rarity''': You sure it's just a silly superstition?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': One can never be completely sure— [muffled]
:'''Applejack''': Yup-solutely! You've been through bad things before. Whatever happens now, you can handle it.
:'''Rarity''': You're right! I have been prepared for the worst. Why not hope for the best?

:'''Rarity''': What a lovely sunset. It reminds me of the—
:'''Fancy Pants''': I've seen lovelier.
:'''Rarity''': Oh. Oh, well, uh, changing the subject—
:'''Fancy Pants''': Right. Back to what I want to talk about – me. Earlier today, I made the best point, immediately followed by the best joke. So I laughed and laughed until everypony left. And that's when I realized the most talented pony I ever met... was me.
:'''Rarity''': Wow. I was so nervous about going walkies with you that I didn't realize... I don't like you.
:'''Fancy Pants''': Uhhhh, excuse me?
:'''Rarity''': Bad thing number three! It's you!
:'''Fancy Pants''': Ohhhh, no-no-no, impossible. You see, I never come in third place. [laughs nervously, clears throat] As I was saying...
:[zip!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': "Sprinkles can't fix everything." [scoffs] Yeah, right!
:'''Rarity''': To be quite frank, the most enjoyable part of the whole thing was freaking out beforehand! [laughs]
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Because I did it with all of you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, I'm glad you were able to stay in the moment, decide you weren't having fun, and go with the flow by hightailing it out of there.
:'''Rarity''': And ''I'm'' glad I didn't steal your souffle recipe, jeopardizing your performance and our friendship. [laughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?
:'''Rarity''': Nothing! Love you!
:'''Mane Six''': Awwwww!

==Badge of Shame==
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just one sugar-frosted maple ice cream cereal souffle cupcake. And you're lucky. It's my last cupcake. Dolores is kaput!
:[electrical sounds]
:[thud]
:[flames roar]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, my dear oven Dolores! And yeah, I named her Dr. Dolores Q. Baker. That's what you do when you love something so much. You give it a name and a Ph.D.! Without Dolores, I'm not a baker! And if I'm not a baker... then who even am I?
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting] Sorry about Dolores, Pinkie, but... could you maybe help a pony out?
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', and '''Fluttershy''': [grunting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh, it's heavy. Whoa. What's in the box? Wait! Isn't today when you're gonna build a machine to earn your Trail Trotters Engineering Badge?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts] Indeed it is. Where should we put the box? Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [blows nose, whimpers] What? Oh. Yeah. I have a corner set aside as your workstation.

:'''Applejack''': [grunts] Why, you could even call this the Sugarcube Corner... Corner!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You could.
:'''Fluttershy''': So, what's the first step?
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Instructions, right? You should always the instructions before building something. [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right you are, my young apprentice. But this will be no sweat at all, for I am the ''Master of Instructions!'' [imitates fanfare]
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [strained fanfare]
:'''Rarity''': I prefer a red carpet, but this'll do.
:[cameras clicking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Careful! Don't walk on the instructions. Twilight needs them to build her machine to get her badge.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, but the truth is these instructions are very confusing. I can't even tell what I'm building in the first place. What are these diagrams supposed to be?
:'''Fluttershy''': This looks like you're supposed to throw the box into the air?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, this looks like a pony playing buckball on a mountain. Or are they in a valley?
:'''Applejack''': Are you supposed to add water? 'Cause, uh, that sure looks like water.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And where are all these arrows pointing?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Looks like some parts are missing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't even figure out step one...! How am I gonna do all ''NINETY-EIGHT STEPS?!'' [shatters]
:'''Applejack''': [to fourth wall] It was then that Twilight Sparkle got very anxious and worked up.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'd offer you one of my special super-duper sweet-and-silly pick-me-up cupcakes. But I just ate my last one, and... [sighs]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, I'm not sure the pick-me-up is working.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess today is a total bust. I'm sorry.
:'''Fluttershy''': You don't need to apologize to us. You deserve to be a Trail Trotter.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm not the Master of Instructions. Or anything else. And I won't be getting my Engineering Badge.
:'''Fluttershy''': We know this feels like an overwhelming problem. But that doesn't mean a solution's impossible.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah! Don't be so glum, chum!
:'''Fluttershy''': You're the Master of Instructions! They're not the master of you, right? So why don't you fix them?
:'''Mane Six sans Twilight Sparkle''': [cheer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yoink! I've been looking for that.
:[zip!]
:[electrical buzzing]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've been doing this all wrong. I won't just fix the instructions. I'm gonna improve them!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoo-hoo! I'm gonna need an assistant!
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Applejack''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm...
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Applejack''': Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': Do it, Pinkie. Do it for the Trail Trotters.
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Applejack''': [cheer]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh...
:[clatter!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheering]
:[cranking]
:[drilling]
:'''Applejack''': [to fourth wall] And so, Twilight Sparkle used her ingenuity to build her own machine.
:[hammering]
:[drilling]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's done.
:'''Rarity''': What is it?
:'''Fluttershy''': It's... a new oven for Pinkie Pie!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': With a few extra bells and whistles.
:[bells and whistles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': This is the best gift a pony could ever get! [giggles]
:[pop!]
:[fizzle]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': So? What's the new oven's name? [chomps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think I'll call her... Dame Dulce de Leche!
:'''Rarity''': I told myself I wouldn't cry! [crying]
:'''Fluttershy''': A new oven and an Engineering Badge. Not a bad way to spend the day. Wouldn't you say, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [muffled] Mmmm! Yeah, right! [gulps] It's the best! [chomps]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]

:[whirring]
:'''Gummy''': [chomps, burps]

==Discord's Peak==
:[ticking]
:[inflating]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah!
:'''Fluttershy''': [inhales, sighs] Smell what I smell?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] You're right. Too much baking powder.
:'''Fluttershy''': No, not yet. I smell an awesome Trail Trotters hike on the horizon.
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': That horizon!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, Fluttershy? You reckon we should be climbin' Mt. Volcanope?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers] What if it erupts while we're up there? That'd be—
:[door opens]
:'''Discord''': Perfect!
:[thunder]
:[poof]
:'''Discord''': But too bad that won't happen. That there magic volcano's been dormant for years. That's why they call it Mt. VolcaNOPE. [chomps]
:'''Fluttershy''': We Trail Trotters are hiking up Mt. Volcanope. You should join the troop and tag along.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No!
:'''Applejack''': [to fourth wall] Things tend to get a little messy when Discord "tags along".
:'''Discord''': Uh... let me think about that.
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': No.
:'''Applejack''': Awww, that's a shame.
:'''Fluttershy''': You suuuuure? It'll be fuuuuun. And by fun, I mean very chaotic. And we'll be facing our fears and putting ourselves in mortal peril!
:'''Discord''': You talk a good game, Fluttershy, but my answer remains the same. I choose not to join, associate, or... pledge loyalty to any such... troop.
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': Whew!
:'''Discord''': [slurps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You gonna choose to pay for those?
:'''Discord''': Hey, look over there!
:[poof]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans]

:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] I wish Discord were here.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Why? He's not a Trail Trotter. He's a walking disaster.
:'''Fluttershy''': But he's ''my'' walking disaster.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sometimes I worry about the friends you choose.
:'''Fluttershy''': Everypony deserves to share in the fun of being a Trail Trotter.
:'''Rarity''': That mischievous miscreant didn't seem all that interested. You can lead a draconequus, but you can't make it take a drink.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles, squeals] I can see Sugarcube Corner from here!
:'''Applejack''': This is what it's all about.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Rarity''', and '''Rainbow Dash''': [sigh, "Whoa"]
:'''Fluttershy''': Just a little chaos.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fluttershy?
:'''Fluttershy''': Enough to get Discord to join in on the fun! [grunts]
:[splash]
:[rumbling]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]

:'''Applejack''': [narrating] Meanwhile, back at Sugarcube Corner...
:'''Spike''': What it'll be?
:'''Discord''': I've already decided. I'm ''not'' hiking up Mt. Volcanope.
:'''Spike''': Uh, I mean what kind of cupcake?
:'''Discord''': I wonder what sorts of boring chaos they're up to. No! I stand by my decision!
:'''Spike''': Cool, cool. Uh, speaking of decisions, what cupcake?
:'''Discord''': Hmm? Oh, hey! Look over there!
:[poof]

:[rumbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's erupting!
:'''Mane Six''': [screaming]
:'''Fluttershy''': Stay calm, everypony! Remember your Trail Trotter training! When in danger, seek safety!
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Fluttershy''': Okay, maybe this is the teensiest bit too much chaos, fear-facing and mortal peril.

:'''Discord''': Well, this has turned out to be a perfectly boring day. [sighs] Wha? That looks like it's coming from Mt. Volcanope! And that must mean Fluttershy's in danger! Danger plus chaos equals perfect! Math. [snaps fingers]
:[poof]

:'''Mane Six''': [whimpering] Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': Discord! A little help, please!
:'''Discord''': I suppose. Why not?
:'''Mane Six''': Whoa...!
:[crackling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You saved the day!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Fluttershy''': I always knew you were a Trail Trotter at heart.
:'''Discord''': No, I'm not. I do not trot.
:'''Fluttershy''': You know what? You're right. I wanted you to be a Trail Trotter when you're really... a Solo Scout!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Discord''': Solo?
:[poof]
:'''Discord''': Hmm. [snaps fingers] I like the sound of that. [slurps] Go on. Tell me, tell me!
:'''Fluttershy''': Solo Scouts are a troop of one. They rely on nopony but themselves. But, oh, you chose not to join, so forget I said anything.
:'''Discord''': Too late! I'm in! I am a Solo Scout! And I'm off to do what we Solo Scouts do best! Solo, so long! Hey, look over there!
:[poof]
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Great idea to make up the Solo Scouts. That's perfect for Discord!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Crazy that somepony could just make up a troop on the spot like that.
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Fluttershy''': It's important to listen to your friends when they tell you something. It was wrong of me to force Discord to do something he didn't want to do. But he really would make a great Scout. [giggles]
:[poof]
:'''Discord''': Uh... a certain Solo Scout can't remember how he got up the mountain, and now he can't get back down. Can he be a... temporary Trail Trotter?
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [groan]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

==Part 1==
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [vocalizing] Aw, yeah... [screams]
:'''Smallfry''': That race was amazing, Rainbow Dash! How do you do it?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aw, thanks, little buddy! It's nothing but a little hard work, natural talent, and all-consuming desire to be the best me I can be.
:'''Smallfry''': Wow...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But I don't do it for the trophies. I do it for the fans.
:[squeak]
:'''Smallfry''': [muffled] So cool.
:[zip!]
:[vroom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not quite level...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': My buddies! What's up?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! Rainbow Dash! I'm glad you're here! Everypony, give it up for Sugarcube Corner's... [echoing] ''Employee of the Month!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But I don't even work here.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're that good. Plus, I'm working on my next humble pie recipe for the next Royal Jelly Juggernaut taping.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Thanks! You know, of all the things I'm good at, my favorite is being friends with all of you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Fluttershy''', '''Rarity''', and '''Applejack''': Awwww!
:[bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ORDER UP!
:[smash!]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Ohhhh, so you're ''the'' Rainbow Dash. I've heard you're the best of the best.
:[knock, knock]
:[smash!]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': But are you the best at being the ''worst''?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... what? 
:'''Dishwater Slog''': I am Dishwater Slog. And I hereby challenge you to a fail-off! When it comes to being the worst, you've got nothing on me.
:'''Mane Six sans Rainbow Dash''': [laugh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That makes no sense.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's nonsensical!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Why would I want to be the worst?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She wouldn't!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [laughs] Guess you're afraid of a wittle friendly competitioooon...
:[scream]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''OH, NO, HE DID NOT!'' I'll show you my worst, all right! You'll rue the day you ever challenged Rainbow Dash! The brash! The crash! The... mustache.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Huh. Pretty good at rhyming, I see. Definitely better than... myself. [laughs] See? I lost the rhyming round. Which means I won the losing round.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait, whaaaat?
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Whoever loses the most in the next twenty-four hours wins. We'll compete in three categories, okay? Athleticism, creativity, and yup, emotions. Think you can handle that, winner? And by that, I mean... [echoing] looooseeerrr.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha! Sit back and watch, everypony, as the best does her worst!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': Hmmm... Rainbow Dash, now why would you try to be worse than you are? About the worst she's ever been is when she forgot to give me back the book I lent her.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't say no to a friendly competition!
:[zip!]
:[crash!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, shouldn't you be rushing out, too?
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Nah. This is kinda my whole thing. I don't try. I'm the best in the game at not trying.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [straining] So... heavy...!
:[crunch!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh! I'm so strong!
:'''Rarity''': Failing isn't quite your style.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [straining] Nice try, Rainbow Dash. But you'll never amount to nothing.
:[wind whistles]
:[can clatters]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here, Rainbow Dash! This cake was a failed experiment, so why don't you take a whack at failing to decorate it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It would be an honor to turn this into a creative failure, Pinkie.
:[icing splattering]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Ooh, impressive!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No, it's not! It's terrible!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Wow! Perfect randomness! It's... It's beautiful! Uh, sorry. But you have to admit it looks good.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Voilà! May I present Sugarcube Corner's Worst Customer of the Month – me!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I have never seen anything worse.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [crying] My picture!
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Hello, hello, everypony! Rainbow, how's—? [shrieks] IT'S HORRID! [faints]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [sighs] Another job poorly done. Keep it up, champ.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay. Now you're making me mad.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Ah-ah-ah. Keep expressing your emotions so healthily, and you'll lose the emotional failure round.
:[honk!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]

==Part 2==
:'''Rarity''': There you are, my fiery friend. With my flair for ''le dramatique'', I will be your inspired director!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Hm. Now this I gotta see. Now, let me explain it so you can understand. The key to being an emotional failure is complete suppression of your feelings!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You don't need to explain it to—!
:'''Rarity''': Rainbow Dash, don't take the bait.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] Right. Game face, on!
:'''Rarity''': Cue Fluttershy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [crying] Could I please have a tiny little hug?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nah, I'm good.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Rejection! Noice!
:'''Rarity''': Cue Applejack! Bring the rage!
:'''Applejack''': Okay, Rainbow Dash, get mad at me! Flying is overrated! There are too many colors in the rainbow! ''You still haven't returned my book!'' Whoa. Got real there for a second.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She is doing it!
:'''Smallfry''': Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! [grunts] Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Smallfry''': [crying]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You okay, little dude?
:'''Smallfry''': Y-Yeah.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls] What is the matter with you?! Don't you feel bad about being so... bad?!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [yawns] Not really.
:[boom!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [echoing] ''You ought to be ashamed of yourself making others feel small all the time! How can you take pride in being so... so... mediocre?!''
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Easily.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': If you're such a big failure, then why are you succeeding at being such a jerk?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [agreeing and cheering]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': I, uh... H-Hey! Okay, that doesn't count!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, ''I'' say it does. You were a champion-level jerk when you painted over Pinkie's portrait! And yet again when you broke Pinkie's sundae glass! Twice! Which means... we're tied!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Fine. If that's how you wanna play it, then we'll just have to have a tie-breaker!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Dishwater Slog''': Loser take all!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': At sunset... we race.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gulps]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': A race?! How am I gonna lose that?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You don't have to do this, Rainbow Dash.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! You're the best, and we love that about you!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know, but... ever since I was a filly, I could never back down from a challenge. And nothing's challenged me like this in a long time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, but purposefully acting worse than you are?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': There must be a way! [gasps] Maybe a potion will make me worse! [gulping]
:[laser sound]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Nope. Still awesome.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's time. [straining] You're gonna win soooo easily!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Yeah, right. You're so fast, you're gonna break the sound barrier.
:'''Rarity''': On your mark... get set...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]
:'''Rarity''': GOOOOOOOO!
:[zip!]
:[vroom!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She's losing! She's really losing! Huh. Doesn't feel great to say.
:'''Applejack''': This just ain't the Rainbow Dash we know and love.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Look! The final leg of the race!
:'''Smallfry''': Go, Rainbow Dash! Beat that meanie!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, yeah, enough of this! I'm a winner! And winners gonna... WIIIIIIIN!
:[vroom!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheering]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [laughs] Knew you couldn't do it. My condolences.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Thank you. Good game.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': W-Wait. What'd you just say?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I said good game. Because that's the nice thing to do when you clobber an opponent.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': But... but... the competition! Don't you wanna beat me at my own game?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nah. I'm good at being me. Awesome, awesome me.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': B-B-But you're not playing by my rules! [groans] I hope you're happy!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I am!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, you're the absolute worst!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... actually, I won. Not to brag.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, but you're the worst at being the worst!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, now that's a title I can get behind. Plus, I don't do it to live up to anypony else's standards. I do it for the fans! Oh! By the way, Applejack, here's your book back. Loved the symbolism!
:'''Applejack''': You really are the best.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! I've been meaning to read that one!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': I've already read it. Let me spoil the ending.

==Bighoof Walking==
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks for letting me test the new critter-sighting app on your tablet, Fluttershy. Your cloud data should be here any moment.
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Cloud security is such a fluffy gig.
:[click]
:[beeping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, installation complete.
:'''Fluttershy''': Great! With this, I'll earn the Rare Animal Sighting Badge in no time!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What kind of animal are you after? The world's slowest cheetah?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A pouchless kangaroo?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awww...
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, those are common compared to the one I'm after. Bighoof!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm freaking out!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're kidding!
:'''Rarity''': Heavens, no!
:[tea kettle whistling]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': I've heard a few pony tales about Bighoof. [sips] Stories say it's a huge, territorial creature with big antlers. And if it catches you there, it'll transform ''you'' into a Bighoof yourself!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Uh... [screams]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. Looking it up on Marepedia. And according to the "scaryravioli" website, everything Applejack says is true.
:'''Fluttershy''': But they also say that it has a great singing voice.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, yeah?
:[beeping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is the only known recording. Listen.
:[low, dissonant groaning]
:'''Mane Six''': [whimper]
:'''Fluttershy''': So majestic.
:'''Rarity''': Majestic, that is, until it captures you! Leaving nothing but its giant, ghastly hoofprints!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you sure about this, Fluttershy? It might not want to be found.
:'''Fluttershy''': What's the worst that could happen?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, it pony-naps us and traps us in the forest and makes us listen to its lonely song forever?! It's new-age elevator music!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', and '''Rarity''': [scream]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [screams] Sounds like an adventure to me!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe we're doing this.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's not like anypony's gonna get hurt. And look how happy Fluttershy is.
:'''Fluttershy''': Everypony, keep an eye out!
:[zip!]
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Hmm. [screams]
:[crows cawing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Phew.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] I see her! She's breathtaking! Oh, wait, that's me. Well, I-I stand by my opinion. Anypony see anything?
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:[wind whistles]
:'''Applejack''': [gulps]
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': [scream]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': See? Nothing to be afraid of, Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': Doesn't mean we shouldn't be careful.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, did you see where Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie went?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, they're right over there.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, no! They've been hoof-napped by Bighoof!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's not jump to conclusions. There's a perfectly logical explanation for— [gasps] Hoofprints!
:'''Applejack''': [gulps] M-Maybe they... just got lost?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whimpers] L-Let's see where these tracks go.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What if they ''have'' been taken?! And now they're trapped in the woods forever?!
:'''Rarity''': Darling, is it me... or have all the animals disappeared?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think we might have to call in some experts.
:'''Rarity''': What if we can't find them again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': W-We just need to keep our wits about us.
:[howling]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [gasp]
:[bushes rustle]
:[thunder]
:'''Rarity''', '''Applejack''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [scream]
:'''Rarity''': Bighoof!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]
:[howling]
:'''Applejack''': Don't go!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I have to! If I don't come back, tell the world my story!
:'''Rarity''', '''Applejack''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yells]
:[slam!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Fluttershy''': [grunting] Ugh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ugh!
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ah! It's even worse than I thought! Oh. Fluttershy? We thought you were Bighoof.
:'''Fluttershy''': Sorry. I was just trying to help Pinkie Pie get unstuck from this tree.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And how did Pinkie Pie get stuck in a tree?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I don't want to talk about it. There was a balloon, a stick... It all happened so fast!
:'''Fluttershy''': Sorry we scared you guys.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Don't be. We're just happy you're both safe.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, Bighoof didn't take you?
:'''Fluttershy''': No. [sighs] Guess I'm not getting my Rare Sighting Badge today.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aww. Maybe next time.
:'''Fluttershy''': It's okay. We still got to go for a fun hike and... [gasps] take a selfie!
:[camera clicks]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp, scream]
:[howling]

==The Fluttershy Effect==
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's going long!
:[zoom!]
:'''Owlowiscious''': [squawks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs, laughs] All the time in the world.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] Rainbow Dash! Oh, thank hoofness I found you!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh-oh. Is something wrong, Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I am in dire need of help... throwing a party – the Trail Trotters' Trail Mixer – for Fluttershy.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But aren't we just pretending to be a Trail Trotters troop?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yup. But she thinks we're supposed to throw a party to attract new ponies to join. So now we have to pretend to do that by actually doing it. And fast!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': More like "in a dash"! You know, 'cause I'm so fast that I can control time? So fast that even I—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''No time!'' Rarity's finishing up the decorations, and Applejack's gathering butterflies in the orchard for... well, you'll see! And Twi has a delivery for you to make!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Chillax. I'll head right over to Twilight's.
:[beeping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh. Uhhhh, what now? A new Wonderbolt game is dropping today?! [deep breath]
:[beeping]

:[owl hoots]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Top score! Wait. When did it become dark? Oh, no. I was supposed to deliver that thingamabob to what's-her-face!

:[zoom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpering]
:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Where have you been?! The party is in an hour, and Rarity still needs the Replitron 5000 to duplicate her decorations!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'll get it there in no time.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just be very careful. This is a really powerful device.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Got it. Powerful device.
:[zoom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]

:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Waiting for me?
:'''Rarity''': Darling... ''this is my "waiting for you" face!'' [squeak] Device, please.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': One decorator duplicator coming up.
:[shooting sounds]
:'''Applejack''': Whoa.
:'''Rarity''': ''Magnifique''!
:[pounding on door]
:'''Fluttershy''': [muffled] Is this a push or a pull?
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] Fluttershy's here! There aren't enough butterflies!
:'''Rarity''': And the decor still needs to be hung! Oh, that's it! The party's ruined!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not... just... yet!
:[rapid clicking]
:[shooting sounds]
:'''Rarity''' and '''Applejack''': [scream]
:[shooting sounds]
:[electricity fizzling]
:[boom!]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa! What's happening?! [screams, grunts]
:[electronic music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity? Applejack? Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie Hologram''': ''Welcome to Monarchville.''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [screams]
:'''Pinkie Pie Hologram''': ''Home of the original Sugarcube Corner. All hail the butterflies.''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. I'm not in Ponyville anymore? Where am I? Some sort of dystopian future?
:'''Pinkie Pie Hologram''': ''Exactly. After the disastrous party – renamed the "Party of Disaster" – all parties were banned.''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Okay. Very funny joke.
:'''Pinkie Pie Hologram''': ''I am not programmed to joke. That fateful day, monarch butterflies were duplicated so much that they blotted out the sky.''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You mean... this was ''my'' fault? Tank! You're here!
:'''Tank''': [through voice box] Yes.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And you talk?!
:'''Tank''': [through voice box] I have been awaiting your return, Rainbow Dash. It was foretold by Twilight Sparkle.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Listen, buddy. I've got to find my way back to fix this. I've got to find a way out of here!
:'''Tank''': [through voice box] Take your time, Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Taking time is what got me into this mess!
:'''Tank''': [through voice box] You must learn the way of the slowpoke. Not every problem is settled through speed alone. Sometimes you must stop, focus, and sit still.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] No time!
:'''Tank''': [through voice box] Stop... focus... be still.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're right. I didn't take the time I needed to start with. I wound up rushing into this pickle. So, to get out of it... [deep breath] I need to stop... focus... be still.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] Rainbow Dash! Oh, thank hoofness I found you!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Thank hoofness I found ''you''! You ever thought about doing some silver accents in your mane?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''There's no time!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Stop... focus... be still. [deep breath] ''Now let's throw a party!'' [gasps, screams]

==A Camping We Will Go==
:'''Applejack''': [deep breath, sighs] The Great Outdoors! Well, I'm pleased as apple pie to be leadin' the Trail Trotters troop on a camping trip. Time to dig our good old hooves into some good old dirt.
:'''Rarity''': [panting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. What's wrong, Rarity?
:'''Rarity''': Good grief. I've forgotten my equipment. [sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': You can share with me.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, you're a peach, Flutter darling. But my equipment was for glamping. Camping in glitz, glamour, and comfort. Comfy mattress, a comfy bathtub, the comfy portable generator to plug in my comfy lamp – it's all very comfy! 
:'''Applejack''': But not the most outdoors-y. No lamps are needed in... [deep breath, sighs] ...the Great Outdoors! Where it gets so dark, you can see all the stars in the night sky.
:[wolf howls]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's stop talking about it, and let's get camping! [panting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Do you have any idea where you're going, Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hah! Hoo! Nope! Just got so excited, I couldn't wait any longer!
:[zip!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]

:'''[Applejack]'''
::I don't know, but I've been told

:'''[Mane Six without Applejack and Rarity]'''
::I don't know, but I've been told

:'''[Applejack]'''
::The campin' badge is made of gold

:'''[Mane Six without Applejack and Rarity]'''
::The camping badge is made of gold

:'''[Applejack]'''
::And over there I saw a mole

:'''[Mane Six without Applejack and Rarity]'''
::And over there I saw a mole

:'''Rarity''': Where?! [yelps]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Rarity?
:'''Rarity''': Aah!
:[splash]
:'''Rarity''': [screams, yelping] I can't get out!
:'''Fluttershy''': Stay calm. The fear is in your head.
:'''Rarity''': But the water rushing around me is very real!
:'''Applejack''': Form a Trail Trotter chain!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [grunts]
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Rarity''': [pants]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [cheering and laughing]
:'''Rarity''': [coughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you okay?
:'''Rarity''': I'm wet but alive.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cannonball!
:[splash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Fluttershy''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, Rainbow!
:'''Fluttershy''': Now we're all wet. Swim time!
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

:'''Applejack''': Huh. Here's a good spot to make camp.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, wonderful news, darling. Let me know when that's all done. I shall be attending to my mane.
:[frog croaks]
:'''Fluttershy''': We all have to help or we won't get the Camping Badge.
:'''Applejack''': You're right as rain, Fluttershy. Twilight, Pinkie, and Rainbow Dash, you three assemble the tents. Fluttershy and Rarity will help me build the fire.
:'''Rarity''': Me? Build? The fire?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo! [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's gotta be an easier way to do this. Master of Instructions?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I... I... I... I need to make a spreadsheet! Calculator!
:[beeping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] By my calculations, we need seven more ponies to get the job done!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, I have a better idea.
:[zooming]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whew! That was "in-tents" [intense]! Get it? In... tents?
:'''Rarity''': [whimpers] Oh! I haven't juggled since my vaudeville days. But I suppose I can try.
:'''Applejack''': Strike the rocks together. That'll create a spark.
:'''Rarity''': All right. [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': I feel like you're holdin' back. Give it your all!
:'''Rarity''': [grunts, sighs] Darlings, this is one pony who is not meant for camping.
:'''Applejack''': Now, that's just silly hogwash.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I wish I had my glamping stuff. I wish I had my comfy mattress. ''I wish I had my lamp!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Applejack''': Now, now. Camping is about gettin' ''out'' of your comfort zone. And you're already doin' that.
:'''Rarity''': Am I?
:'''Applejack''': Yup. Just by comin' on this trip.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Applejack''': I know today was hard and maybe even scary, but I'm right proud of ya.
:'''Fluttershy''': Me, too.
:'''Rarity''': But I fell in the river.
:'''Fluttershy''': And got yourself out.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You swam in the pond.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And you hiked into the woods.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': All without your glamping equipment.
:'''Applejack''': See? You're good at campin'. So, what do you say? Want to grab those rocks and light our campfire?
:'''Rarity''': [deep breath, grunting] Hah!
:[flames roaring]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:[pop!]
:'''Rarity''': Perhaps I was born to play the part of a camper after all.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And I'm ready to get close up to some camping treats!
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mm-mm!

:'''Mane Six''': [indistinct chatter]
:[horse whinnies]
:'''Rarity''': [deep breath, sighs] The Great Outdoors!

==Campfire Stories==
:[beep]
:[upbeat music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scatting]
:[music winds down]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[buzzing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! Hmm...
:[egg mixer whirring]
:[blender whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] Hmm...
:[electric fizzling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Hah!
:[whirring builds]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:[electric fizzling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh, pretty. Wait. This can't be good.

:'''Fluttershy''': [singsong] Tablet time... I love my tablet time...
:[winding down]
:'''Rarity''': [wailing] My eyes! I can't see!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whimpering] Gonna be honest! I don't love the dark!
:[light switch clicking]
:'''Applejack''': Okay, hang on. Hang on, y'all. Let's keep it together long enough to find out what happened. We're gonna need a little artificial sunshine.
:[clatter]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmm, anypony else happen to... plug in a device and get purple sparks?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': No.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, no purple sparks around here.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cool, cool. Cool, cool. Yeah, uh-huh. Definitely not from me either. [laughs nervously] Good to know.
:'''Fluttershy''': Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Oh. The electrician won't be here for at least an hour.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, hang on, everypony. We could stand around getting mad that the power's off. We could sit around wishing on potion magic that we were electricians. Or we could pass the time by... telling stories!
:'''Rarity''': I guess that could be...
:'''Fluttershy''': ...kind of fun!

:'''Fluttershy''': I got one! I got a real good one! Remember the time we baked a twenty-seven-layer cupcake?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, yes!

:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] It was a normal day. Everypony was baking together and having fun.
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': ''More layers! We need more layers!'' [panting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No way. It's the perfect size.
:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] But soon, our perfect cupcake would devolve into perfect chaos!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah!
:[rattling]
:'''Cupcake Monster''': [roars]
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait, wait, wait! You're making it sound like a kitchen nightmare! It wasn't scary. Here's how it really happened.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting] Jam, ponies! Discord's making his famous lava brownies, and we cannot be shown up!
:[whooshing]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Excuse me! That is ridiculous! There are inaccuracies all over these stories.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, then how ''did'' it happen?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It was a lovely sunny day.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [narrating] We were baking in the kitchen. I combined four eggs, two cups of milk, a cup of flour, a pinch of magic, exactly one bag of sugar—

:'''Rarity''': [sighs] I am on the verge of fainting... at your level of detail! That wasn't the story at all. It was a very accurate cupcake recipe.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, excuuuuuuse me for being meticulous! Why don't you regale us with ''your'' story?
:'''Rarity''': Ah, with pleasure and gusto. It was a day not unlike today. Jazz was all the rage.

:'''Rarity''': [narrating] I had to be at Jay's mansion on East Egg in two hours. Little did I know, his old flame Daffodil lived across the way. Anywho, I had no idea where my prized diamond necklace was. Not the really good one, mind you. The ''really'' really good one. Ugh! And I was retracing all of my steps, starting in the forest. "Where is my necklace? Where—?"

:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''RARITY!'' That's not the story we're telling.
:'''Rarity''': Well, it's the story ''I'm'' telling.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, ''we're'' telling the tale of the twenty-seven-layer cupcake.
:'''Applejack''': Now that I think about it, wasn't it thirty layers?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Am I drinking crazy potion, or was it twenty-seven one-layer cupcakes?
:'''Fluttershy''': It was very specifically one huge twenty-seven-layer cupcake!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did we win an award? I think we won for fastest baking.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's no such award!
:'''Mane Six''': [indistinct arguing]
:[boom!]
:[whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-oh.
:[splatting]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Quick! Unplug the mixing bowl!
:[ding!]
:[electric fizzle]
:[whoosh]
:[beep]
:'''Mane Six''': Whew! [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I wonder how we're all gonna remember ''this''.
:'''Fluttershy''': As long as we remember we're together as friends, it's a memory we're gonna share forever.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm also writing all of this down for accuracy. "It was the best of times... it was the ''best'' of times!"
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

==Close Encounters of the Balloon Kind==
:[deep humming]
:[zip!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Get 'em while they're hot and tasty! New glittery treats featuring cosmic cotton candy crystals! Straight from the oven and...
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laughing]
:[whoosh!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...into your mouth. [chomps]

:[giggling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggling]

:'''Rarity''': I dare say, dear girl, these cupcakes are so good, I think I need to lie down. [chomps]
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm gonna spend the whole day baking new treats. And you'll be my taste-testing team.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's literally nothing that can come between me and my baking!
:[squirt]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': I reckon you spoke too soon, Pinkie. Somethin's out there blockin' the sun.
:[sci-fi music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Maybe it's another cosmic event!
:'''Mane Six''': Uh...
:'''Fluttershy''': I have no idea what in Equestria it could be. It's a mysterious mane-scratcher.
:[deep humming]
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It looks like something's inside. Are any of you... scared?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [whimpering]
:'''Rarity''': Yes! Here we go again...
:[poof!]
:[squirrel chittering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': S-Should we... follow that squirrel?
:'''Applejack''': Why would we do that?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I-I don't know! I panicked!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We should wait and see what happens. And in the meantime, we can study this giant balloon... airship?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I don't know if it's my nerves or the phrase "giant balloon airship", but every time I think about what's inside that thingy, my thoughts go from sweet to sour. Is anypony else's imagination running wild?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': ["Mm-hmm", "Uh-huh", etc.]
:'''Applejack''': Yup. And... start fantasy sequence montage.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': There could be more rare baking ingredients inside! [giggling]
:[squirt!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Stuff me full of cookies, that's chocolate lava! [laughs] The scorching s'mores I could make! Huh? That's a lot of chocolate lava! Coming right for me! Rarity, what do ''you'' think it could be?
:'''Rarity''': Maybe the balloon will transform into a stage! Ponies will gather from far and wide to watch me perform my one-pony show ''Lamilton''! I play a little lamb who transforms the world through song and i-lamb-ic pentameter!
::[singing]
::I wanna be in the loom where wool happens
::The loom where wool—
:[crowd booing]
:[tomatoes splatting]
:'''Rarity''': [grunting] Didn't expect a pelting! Get it? A "pelt"-ing? [laughs]
:[splat!]
:'''Rarity''': Okay. I'll see myself out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Or the balloon could be a giant library containing all the information in the universe! What I would give to be inside with all those books!
:[rumbling]
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A reading light would be nice.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe it's a balloon monster! Maybe it's Balloonga the Destroyer!
:'''Balloonga''': Behold! I am Balloonga! All ponies bow before— Wait. "Balloonga"? My name's "Balloonga"?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, I'm not good with names.
:'''Balloonga''': But ''I'' am good with manes! [laughs evilly]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yells] Quick! Who's next?!
:'''Applejack''': Uh... maybe the balloon is full of apples?

:'''Applejack''': Hoo-wee! [laughs]
:[squirt!]
:'''Applejack''': [whimpers] Even I know that's too many apples! [screams]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hm. This fantasy feels familiar.
:'''Applejack''': End montage! End montage!
:[poof!]

:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe all those will happen. Or none of them. Honestly, I'm okay with waiting to find out.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're not scared? It could be any of those things! That's... well, it's... it's scary!
:'''Fluttershy''': Am I curious about the giant, mysterious, hovering, glowing airship balloon that none of us have any idea what it could be or what will happen next because of it being here all of a sudden?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': ["Yes!"/"Exactly!", whimpering]
:'''Fluttershy''': But that doesn't mean we should jump to the worst-case scenario. Everypony take a deep breath.
:'''Mane Six''': [inhale, exhale]
:'''Fluttershy''': Repeat after me. The unknown is not scary.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': The unknown is not...
:'''Mane Six''': [yelp]
:'''Rarity''': [faints]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': By my calculations, I think this balloon – I mean, these ''balloons'' – are somehow related to the cosmic event of the Cotton Candy Comet!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm. What makes you say that, Twi?
:[deep humming]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yup. Story checks out. Pinkie, you look nervous.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I feel it!
:'''Fluttershy''': The unknown is not scary.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The unknown is not scary!
:'''Fluttershy''': In a way, it's actually kind of exciting 'cause we'll figure it out together. Right?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': ["Yup"/"Mm-hmm", whimper]
:[ominous music]
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Cliffhanger.

==The Tiara of Truth==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:'''Rarity''': Pinkie, darling, I know this taste test is a big deal, but do you think you might be overdoing it on the streamers just a teensy bit?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope! A dessert like my splendiferous cupcakes deserves double the sweetness, triple the decorations, and quadruple the taste-testers!
:'''Rarity''': Speaking of, where are they?
:[cuckoo clock]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're right. Everypony's ''late!'' [groans] They promised that they'd be here fifteen sprinkles ago. For maximum effect, the cupcakes need to be tasted ''right at four o'clock!''
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': I'm sure they have a good reason.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Even so, I can't wait. Hurry, Rarity! You have to try one ''right now!''
:'''Rarity''': [chomps]
:[fizzling]
:'''Rarity''': [babbles] 
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well? What do you think? Too much sugar?
:'''Rarity''': No, no. Uh, it's the perfect amount of sugar. So absolutely delectable, Pinkie. Just... divine.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo!
:[pop!]
:'''Rarity''': [laughs nervously, gags, barfs]
:'''Gummy''': [chomps]
:[8-bit music]
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, no! Two sprinkles past four!
:[cuckoo clock]
:'''Applejack''': Did we miss it?
:[poof!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yes. Yes, you did.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're sorry.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': My bad.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oopsies.
:'''Applejack''': Honestly, I just plumb forgot it was Thursday. Sorry, Pinkie.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I have a good reason.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [narrating] I was super-focused on conducting a complex experiment, and I completely lost track of time.
:[bubbling]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [narrating] And I just placed first in a wing-lifting competition. They'd just given me my trophy when...
:[clock ticks]

:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] As for me, I was hosting a bountiful bunny brunch for Angel and his buddies. [speaking] Oh, my! Ohhh!
:[zip!]

:'''Fluttershy''': But... I brought you this.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What a unique apology gift. Thanks, Fluttershy.
:[shimmering]
:'''Mane Six''': [sounds of awe]
:[mystical music]
:'''Rarity''': There was a tiara inside?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! All of a sudden, I feel a strong urge to tell you ponies that... ''I love Brussels sprouts!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoa. I think that tiara might have some magical properties. Do you mind if I try it on, Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure, I... Whoa.
:[mystical music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I wasn't late because I was conducting an experiment. [gasps] I was...

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...painting lawn gnome ponies! It's my secret hobby!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've never told anypony that before.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just as I suspected! This tiara makes the pony who wears it tell the truth!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cool! My turn!
:[mystical music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I am the most awesome pony I know. [laughs] Hey, it works.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why were you late today?
:[mystical music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Truth is...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [narrating] ...I was gonna compete, but the new ''Daring Do'' book was just way too un-put-down-able!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Fluttershy''': Okay, fine.

:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] I was on the sixth attempt at making Angel Bunny an acceptable lunch.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[shatter!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh.

:[mystical music]
:'''Applejack''': I plumb forgot it was Thursday.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh.
:'''Applejack''': Told ya. I cannot tell a lie.
:'''Rarity''': Is it my turn? I need a mirror. I'm going to need to see how I—
:[mystical music]
:'''Rarity''': Look, Pinkie Pie. Your cupcakes are too sweet. Just inedible. I can't imagine a single pony would enjoy them in all of Ponyville.
:'''Rarity's Reflection''': [gasps]
:[shatter!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Awww. Why did you say they were divine?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. I suppose I was just trying to spare your feelings.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sniffles] Well... spare me any more thoughts! [sobs]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': The truthiest truth is... I'm sorry, Pinkie.
:'''Fluttershy''': We all are.
:'''Rarity''': And, well, I only lied because I don't want to hurt anypony's feelings. Especially those of my best friends.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's okay. But in the future, we should all take a lesson from Applejack and be a little more honest with each other. Starting... now!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Honestly, I still want to try your new cupcakes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo!
:[pop!]
:[poof!]
:[suction sounds]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now tell me what you ''really'' think.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Mmmm!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]

==The Comet Section==
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow! Is all this for the Cotton Candy Comet Festival?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, of course, darling! It's going to be an unmissable, once-in-a-lifetime, extra-grand extravaganza! I've booked the incomparable DJ Pon-3 as our musical accompaniment, and I've asked Zesty here to prepare a cosmic-sized party sub. But it's still missing one thing. You! I was hoping you could use that big, beautiful noodle of yours to calculate when the comet will arrive down to the second. [claps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm...
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Considering relative speed, mass, and density, and of course factoring in Ponpernicus' law of celestial bodies, I predict that it's impossible to calculate exactly when it will arrive.
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': All right, but if you had to? Say, down to the second?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... I guess 8:23pm and twelve seconds?
:'''Rarity''': I knew your noodle could do it!

:[electronic music]
:'''Rarity''': Come one, come all, to the pony event of the year! The Cotton Candy Comet Festival!
:'''Applejack''': [sniffs] Well, I've never seen so much sandwich in one place. Rarity, can we dig in?
:'''Rarity''': Momentarily, darling. The festival begins once the comet arrives in... nine seconds!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Esteemed guests, cast your eyes upward at the magnificent splendor of the Cotton Candy Comet!
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Wait for it... Wait for it... Continue to wait for it...
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Rarity''': Keep waiting for it...
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Twilight! Where's my comet?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know! I must not have calculated for orbital interference! And the speed, divide by density... [gasps] The comet won't actually arrive until tomorrow!
:'''Rarity''': Tomorrow?!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Thank you all so much for coming to this dress rehearsal of the Cotton Candy Comet Festival.
:[crowd grumbles]
:'''Rarity''': The real festival will take place tomorrow night!
:[crowd grumbling]

:'''Rarity''': Huh? Twilight, there you are!
:[boxes shuffling]
:'''Rarity''': I've nearly recreated my festival for this evening. Zesty was able to prepare another delicious sandwich. On short notice, she wasn't actually able to make it party-sized. And I couldn't re-book DJ Pon-3, but I was able to find backup in the form of—
:[discordant guitar]
:'''Spike''': Sorry. Just trying to remember how to play.
:[twang!]
:[microphone feedback]
:'''Rarity''': Just keep practicing, Spike. Everything will be fine ''if'' we know exactly when the comet will arrive.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. So I reworked the math, and the comet should arrive tonight at exactly 7:57 and seven seconds.
:'''Rarity''': Ooh!

:[acoustic guitar]
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Rarity''': Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Cotton Candy Comet Festival! Gaze upon the most astounding sight your pony eyes have pony-seen!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering]
:'''Rarity''': Tomorrow?! Uhhhh... Just kidding! This was another dress rehearsal!
:[crowd grumbling]
:'''Rarity''': See you all tomorrow for the real deal!

:[crowd murmuring]
:[saxophone playing]
:'''Rarity''': [whimpers]

:[crowd grumbling]
:[keyboard clacking]

:[paper flapping]
:'''Zesty''': [burps]
:[deep horn sound]
:[crowd grumbling]
:[keyboard clacking]
:'''Rarity''': Twilight! You're supposed to be a genius! Where's my comet?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know! I'm sorry. I know everypony is counting on me, but... I just can't figure it out! ''I'm a failure!''
:[shatter!]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Oh, Twilight. I've been so focused on planning a festival to impress my friends that I forgot to actually ''be'' a friend. Allow me to help you with this rascally space rock.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The comet just doesn't seem to adhere to the laws of physics.
:'''Rarity''': I know how she feels. Some of us naturally defy expectations.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Are you suggesting that the comet defies the laws of physics because it's not governed by science but instead by magic? And therefore adheres to a completely different set of mathematical principles?!
:'''Rarity''': You... took the words right out of my mouth.

:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''Rarity''': Behold! We've cracked the code of the Cotton Candy Comet!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We know exactly when it'll show up, which means we can plan the perfect festival to celebrate!
:'''Fluttershy''': Are you really sure this time?
:'''Rarity''': Absolutely, Flutter-bug. I have faith in Twilight. And luckily, we still have our entertainment in place.
:[discordant music]
:'''Rarity''': We have some work to do.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]

==Cotton Candy-Colored Glasses==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! I can't wait to see this comet!
:'''Fluttershy''': I haven't been this excited for something since ''Roger the Singing Dolphin 3: Sing Louder'' came out!
:'''Rarity''': After all of those almost-comet-arrivals, I thought my enthusiasm would've dwindled, but no. ''I too am excited!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And I've been thinking. What if we use this opportunity to get a new mixer for the shop?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, we could stand to replace the old one. So what did you have in mind?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So glad you asked. I'm gonna sell some of my nifty homemade crafted merch at the comet viewing. Hats, silly straws in the shape of a comet's tail, actual cotton candy, and T-shirts!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [reading] "I Saw the Comet and All I Got Was This T-Shirt, and I Don't Know What's Better – the Shirt or the Comet".
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I like it!
:'''Rarity''': Fab-dibby-dabulous! And just my size, too!
:[rip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Get your comet stuff! Remember the thing you haven't done yet before it happens so you'll never forget it again after it does!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Reuse Pony''': Oh! New T-shirts!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! And they say "I Saw the Comet and All I Got Was—"
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hi, hi, sorry, sorry, give me a second!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What is it, Twilight? I'm in the middle of a sale.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's just it. I found something else you can sell. I was telling the other ponies about it, and I had to show you. Crystal glasses that let you see the full kaleidoscope of the comet's colors. You can order them in bulk on eNeigh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': These... are... perfect!
:'''Reuse Pony''': Sorry, can I just, uh... I wanna grab that silly straw.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh. I'm sorry. Here you go!
:'''Reuse Pony''': [groans] I've seen sillier.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] I need those glasses.
:[beeping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] What? They're all sold out!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': All of them!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No way!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How did this happen?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know. It said they were in stock.

:[wheels squeaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Never reveal a trade secret in front of a bush. You never know who's scheming behind it. And... complete order! [laughs evilly]
:[fly buzzing]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [coughs] Ugh, okay.

:'''Applejack''': Aw, shucks, Rainbow. I'm sorry about the glasses. It would've been fun, but you've got plenty of other great merch to choose from.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Get your comet swag! Get your crystal glasses guaranteed to make the comet look absolutely astounding!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Dishwater's got the glasses!
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I gotta investigate. Here. AJ, can I borrow that banana bandana?
:'''Applejack''': Uh...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat] How do I look?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, like you? But more "ap-peel-ing"?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] It'll have to do.
:[zip!]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Get your crystal glasses guaranteed to make—!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat, posh accent] Hello there. I'm... Fancy Banana Moonbeam, and I'd like to buy some glasses.
:'''Applejack''': [whispering] "Fancy Banana Moonbeam"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering] I kinda like it.
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Okay. That'll be two hundred bits, please.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Two hundred?! Hah! That's ten times what they cost online! No way, pal!
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [gasps] Rainbow Dash?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, um... [clears throat] Er...
:'''Applejack''': Well, w-we gotta go! Good luck with your price gougin'!
:[zip!]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] This is the worst! Now nopony can afford the special glasses!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll still be able to see the comet. Just not as bright. Or colorful. Or sparkly.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''That's not helping!''
:'''Applejack''': Hang on a second. I might have an idea. Meet me at my apple shack before the comet viewin' tomorrow. For once, you're gonna be glad I never throw anythin' away. [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?

:'''Dishwater Slog''': Comet glasses! Get your comet glasses! Only two hundred bits a pop! Nopony? Nopony? Sure you don't wanna see all the comet's colors?
:'''Fluttershy''': [scoffs] Not for ''that'' price, thank you very little!
:[rumbling]
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, bobbins! That is the grandest accessory I have ever beheld!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But how did you do it?
:'''Applejack''': Well, I knew those glasses looked familiar. Turns out I still had my great aunt Goldie's great granny's cousin Strudel's leftover glasses from the comet's last appearance squirrelled away. So Rainbow and I figured a way that the whole town could enjoy 'em.
:[boom!]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Crowd''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And it's so much better because now all of us can share the awesomeness together. Everypony, come look! The comet's coming!
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who needs a new mixer when you're mixing it up with friends like this?
:'''Dishwater Slog''': Ugh!
:[crack!]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [sighs]

==Cute Impact==
:'''Mane Six sans Twilight Sparkle''': Three... two... one... Happy New Moon!
:'''Gummy''': [blows party horn]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': These snacks are stellar, Pinkie!
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': You be careful now. That thing looks like it's about— Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Watch out!
:'''Rarity''': [slow motion scream]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, ''magnifique''!
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow, Twilight. You're always here when we need you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And tonight, I'm here with my latest creation – the celestiascope!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Uh...
:[light switch clicks]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Hmm... [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's a portable planetarium. I like to use it to study the stars and unlock the secrets of the cosmos. Plus... it's preeeetty!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': This is so exciting! I don't even know how I'll sleep tonight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So who wants an astronomy lesson?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [snoring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's okay. Now I can dig into doing a deep scan of the skies.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoa. [gasps] Hmm. That's not right. Nothing ever shines in that area. It's just a void. It's probably nothing, Twilight. [laughs nervously, gasps] It's really there! And it's headed straight for Ponyville! [whimpers]

:[rooster crows]
:'''Applejack''': Equestria to Twilight. Come in, Twilight!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know what will wake her up. Pancakes! Heavy on the marmalade. The ''impact'' of flavors will leave a citrusy ''crater'' in her mouth.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Impact"?! "Crater"?!
:[thunder strikes]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What is it?!
:'''Fluttershy''': What is what?
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nothing! Gotta study! No time to sleep! Just study! Sleep! Study!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': What's gotten into her?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Not pancakes.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's gotta be something here on strange pink lights in the sky! Now, where's the "Impending Doom/Ponyville Historical Records" section?! Hmm...
:[whoosh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why are you all here?
:'''Applejack''': Uh... it's a library. We came to check out books. And check on you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It was great seeing you all, but I have to get back to work.
:'''Fluttershy''': Are you sure you don't need help investigating something?
:'''Rarity''': If there's a mystery afoot, I'm your mare. I lead the library's "Dashing Dame Detective Story Hour" twice a week. Thrice, if they'll have me.
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': They haven't yet.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! This is really something I should do on my own.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm...
:[scribbling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ah... [muffled sneeze]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Fluttershy''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]

:'''Rarity''': Hmm... [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]

:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [grunts]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! Don't read—!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': "''The End of Equestria, Volume 16''"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...that.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know, right? I always thought there were only fifteen volumes.
:'''Rarity''': No pancakes at breakfast? Refusing time with your friends? "''The End of Equestria''"?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! We all know something's up!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:[shatter!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] It's true. Something ''is'' up. In the sky. Last night, while viewing the star charts on the celestiascope, I saw something I couldn't explain.
:'''Applejack''': Why couldn't you just tell us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't want to worry anypony. But it's a lot harder than I thought to take this on alone. I should've told you.
:'''Fluttershy''': You can always tell us. Our friendship speaks volumes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! Sixteen of 'em!
:'''Applejack''': Well, we better get to readin'.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There it is! That's the strange pink light! [reading] "When the new moon wanes on the eve of Indigo Summer" – that's a once-in-a-lifetime event – "the Cosmic Cotton Candy Comet will return."
:'''Rarity''': [reading] "Fear not its mysterious radiance, as it will bring pure joy." 
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [reading] "Before it arrives, a current of sugary crystal morsels will float by"?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [reading] "The sky will become a pastel, multicolored light show."
:'''Applejack''': [reading] "And it's traditional to celebrate its passin' by throwin' a festival."
:'''Fluttershy''': [reading] "So everypony who witnesses the comet will have one special wish come true." Twilight, you've made an amazing discovery!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''We'' made this discovery together! [yawns] There's truly no greater problem-solving power than friendship.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Shhhh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [snoring]
:[air fizzles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[crash!]

==The Crystal Capturing Contraption==
:[keyboard clacking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Pbbbbblt! Peter Pony picked a pack of perfect peonies. A pack of perfect peonies Peter Pony picked.
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Are we filming? Oh, get my good side. Hah! They're all my good sides! Now, whatever are you up to, Flutter-loves?
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! Hi, Rarity. After the success of my YouHoof unboxing video, I want to follow in your hoofsteps and be a reporter. And I have just the story – the Cosmic Cotton Candy Comet!
:'''Rarity''': Stupendous! But this is just a topic. You still need a way in. An entree point. [giggles] I know! Interview all of us! Ask us what ''we'' think of the comet. Be a real pony on the scene!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. I don't like the sound of that. I ''love'' it!

:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm here with athlete extraordinaire Rainbow Dash. What do you think about the Cosmic Cotton Candy Comet?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It'll be cool.
:[whoosh]
:'''Fluttershy''': Aah!
:[pinball sounds]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

:'''Fluttershy''': So, Twilight, it was you that discovered the comet. Uh, hello?
:[printing sounds]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] She's speechless.

:'''Applejack''': I'm more focused on growin' season. Comets don't grow on trees. But apples do. And they need tendin' to.
:[wheelbarrow squeaking]

:'''Rarity''': Comets are out of this world. But what's ''in'' this world is my new one-pony show, ''Fiddler on the Hoof''! I play a musician who's afraid of heights, but I wind up on this roof, and I—
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': Awww.

:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] Hopefully, good old Pinkie Pie gives me some A-plus material.
:[wrench ratcheting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie, the Cosmic Cotton Candy Comet is coming. Tell the world what you think about it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I ''was'' nervicited – which is a mixture of nervous and excited – but now I'm strebebelief! That's stressed beyond belief!
:'''Fluttershy''': Go on.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] I love you, Fluttershy, but I don't have time! A current carrying Cosmic Cotton Candy Comet crystals will fly over Equestria ''tonight!'' These crystals are an incredibly rare baking ingredient!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [narrating] I went back to the library and discovered the last time the comet appeared, only ''one'' tiny blob of crystals was captured, and they were immediately used to make the most delicious dessert in Ponyville history!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': I need those crystals! They'll take my treats to new extremes!
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': This is just the kind of interview I need! Let's get those crystals!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I would, but I'm worried my crystal-catching contraption isn't gonna cut it!
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm. Maybe I can help ''you'', and ''you'' can help ''me''. Tell me, what do you think it'd be like to get caught in a current of cotton candy crystals?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wha...? I-I told you, I don't have time for... ''The crystals are coming!'' I'm gonna get to the top of Mt. Volcanope to get as close as possible!
:[zip!]
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs]

:[click]
:[whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [grunting] It's not strong enough! And I'm not close enough! If only I was ''in'' the crystal current! Ugh! But how could I be ''in'' the—? [gasps] Fluttershy! ''I need you!''

:'''Fluttershy''': These crystals sure do sparkle like a mane that just got washed. And it's now that I'd cut away to an interview about what makes the crystals so special. But sadly, this pony was unable to—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] Flutter... need... to talk!
:'''Fluttershy''': No. I need to talk to ''you'', Pinkie. I let the pressure to get the perfect interview get in the way of being a good friend. I'm sorry.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, ''I'' need to apologize. Those cotton candy crystals clouded my judgment, and I didn't stop to really listen to you. I'm sorry.
:[squeak]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There'll be time for hugs later! I know a way ''I'' can get my crystals and ''you'' can really be a reporter pony on the scene ''if'' we work together.

:[exciting music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You ready?
:'''Fluttershy''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Fluttershy, grow! Fluttershy, grow!
:[whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] The treats I'll bake with these!
:'''Fluttershy''': [distorted] Oh, the amazing news I'll report!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': And if it weren't for the help of a great reporter and even greater friend, today would've been a bust.
:'''Fluttershy''': No day is a bust when friends work together. And that is the story of the Cosmic Cotton Candy Comet, the crystal current, and the capturing contraption. Back to you, Karen.

:'''Karen''': That was our new pony on the scene Fluttershy!
:'''Herd Happily''': In other news – pasta. What is it?

==Part 1==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo! Give me your best game face!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's the Bake Day, baby!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's do this!
:'''Rarity''': Get your cakes out of the oven and into some icing!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm feelin' ''pumped!''
:'''Applejack''': [yells]
:'''Fluttershy''': The cake is yours to take! [growls]
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': Awwwww!
:'''Rarity''': Darling, you're so cute when you're trying to be tough.
:'''Fluttershy''': I ''can'' be tough! I have a dark side! ''Get those cakes in the oven!''
:[thunder cracks]
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': Awwwww!
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans]

:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] Huh?
:'''Foal''': [giggling]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gravelly] Oh, no! The ants are taking over the picnic basket! [high-pitched] "We're being invaded!" [screams]
:'''Bubbles''': "They've seized the sandwiches! They must be stopped!" Bubbles Cherub McSquee. May I join you?
:'''Fluttershy''': Fluttershy. Have a seat. You like making up conversations, too?
:'''Bubbles''': "They've broken through to the pie! We have to make a call here!"
:'''Fluttershy''': "Take the pie!"
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Bubbles''': "Sacrifice the sandwiches!" [laugh]
:'''Bubbles''': Ooh, you are so cool.
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': I just don't see the point of savory desserts. They're supposed to be sugary sweet.
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': What's, uh, crackin' ya up over there, Fluttershy?
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughing hysterically]
:'''Rarity''': Darling.
:'''Fluttershy''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': You haven't even touched your triple choco-loco shake.
:[splat]
:'''Rarity''': Who are you conversing with?
:[zoom!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [reading] "I'm at an art gallery, but it's more like a 'fart gallery'. These paintings stink."
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughing hysterically] Oh, my new friend Bubbles is so funny!
:'''Applejack''': Don't you think that's kinda mean?
:'''Fluttershy''': It's not mean. He's just got a dark sense of humor. Just like me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, if he's a friend of yours, he's a friend of ours.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We'd love to meet him!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! [laughing hysterically] Oh, my gosh! Yes!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then it's settled.
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughing] What's settled now?

:[music]
:'''Applejack''': Where's Fluttershy? She's never late.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': She's gonna miss the stretch and warm-up. She could pull a muscle. [grunts]
:[door whirs]
:'''Applejack''': Oh. You made it. You two still have time to do a few hoof touches before we start.
:'''Fluttershy''': Yeah, we're squeezing it in. This is Bubbles.
:'''Applejack''': Hiya, Bubbles. Pleasure to meet ya. Heard a lot about ya.
:'''Bubbles''': [sarcastically] Yeah, I bet you have.
:[beat]
:[music continues]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': All right, everypony! Who's ready to work out?!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Bubbles''': Ugh. Would we be here if we weren't?
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': And one! Two! Three!
:'''Bubbles''': Um, I didn't realize this was a class to learn how to count.
:[pop!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

:'''Fluttershy''': [straining] These weights are heavier than I thought! Bubbles! [giggles] You're such a prankster!
:[clang!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [yells, giggles]

:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', and '''Fluttershy''': [straining]
:'''Bubbles''': Whoopsy!
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', and '''Fluttershy''': Aah! [grunt]
:'''Fluttershy''': That hurt... But you gotta admit it's funny!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What is your deal?
:'''Bubbles''': I'm sooooorryyyyy... [purrs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ohhhh! You can't stay mad at that face!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Bubbles''': Oh, I almost forgot! I got us friendship bracelets!
:'''Applejack''': That won't fix anythin'.
:'''Fluttershy''': [squeals] Bubbles, you're the best! Thanks!

:'''Spike''': This is literally the coolest place I've ever been in my entire life!
:'''Bubbles''': That's just sad.
:[pop!]
:'''Spike''': Aw.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ohhhh. Ooh, check out this book!
:'''Bubbles''': Already read it. Saw the movie. It was bad. Bo-ring. Lame cover. Bet it's bad.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But you can't judge a book by its cover.
:'''Bubbles''': I can.

:'''Bookstore Pony''': Ah, yes. Three months of work all done.
:[crash!]
:'''Fluttershy''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': Bubbles, how could you?
:'''Bubbles''': Oopsies!
:'''Fluttershy''': Awww... [giggles]
:'''Bookstore Pony''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's okay. We'll help you rebuild it. You said it only took...
:'''Bookstore Pony''': Three months. Closer to four. [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Can you two help?
:'''Bubbles''': Sorry, my paws are full... with B.F.F. necklaces to ''match our bracelets!''
:'''Spike''': There's no way she'd fall for—
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] You're the best!
:'''Bookstore Pony''': [sighs]

==Part 2==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Thanks for being my taste-testers as I sail into the uncharted waters of savory dessert! I now present... the cheesy spinach cupcake! Enjoy!
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Applejack''': [chomp]
:'''Fluttershy''': Uhhh... Oh, my, Pinkie. This is...
:'''Applejack''': This dessert is still sweet. Like, "taffy dipped in ice cream rolled in sugar" level sweet.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''I couldn't do it! I had to add sugar! They're cupcakes, for crying out loud!'' I'll never win the Royal Jelly Juggernaut!
:'''Bubbles''': Ugh! Who cares? Reality TV is trash anyway.
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Bubbles! You can't say things like that! It's mean!
:'''Bubbles''': It's the truth. I just can't sugarcoat reality.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But... you should sugarcoat ''everything!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pinkie, don't listen to—
:[pop!]
:[fizzle]
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...him.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no! How could you—?
:'''Bubbles''': Was it something I said?
:'''Fluttershy''': Awwww. Ugh. No, Bubbles!
:'''Bubbles''': [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': We have to talk about—
:'''Bubbles''': Look what I got! A B.F.F. anklet!
:'''Fluttershy''': Awwww. [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': I think that's enough from you! Look what you have done! Upsetting our sweet Miss Pie!
:'''Bubbles''': All I did was tell the truth.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, you did, but this time it came out too mean.
:'''Bubbles''': If you can't handle me at my realest, then you don't deserve me at my cutest! I'm outie! And I'm taking my things.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Hey! Those were a symbol of our friendship. I've never seen him like this. So... so...
:'''Rarity''': Mean?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs, whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fluttershy, the fact of the matter is that Bubbles hasn't been the nicest to us.
:'''Fluttershy''': You're right. He really hasn't been that nice to me, either. He just looks cute and gives me a gift whenever he's mean. I think it's time you see my dark side ''once and for all!''
:[rumbling]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, I'm not sure you can... Okay, all right, you've got this!

:'''Bubbles''': [slurping]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hey! You don't just talk to my friends like that and then bail!
:'''Bubbles''': Oh... Fluttershy, is it? What brings you all the way over to Sugar Packet Place?
:'''Fluttershy''': What is going on? You just took our friendship jewelry and left.
:'''Bubbles''': Listen, our friendship was fun while it lasted, but I'm just too cool for you and your friends.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps, growls]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': Aah!
:'''Rarity''': [screams angrily]
:'''Bubbles''': This is my ''new'' best friend Buttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': You already have a ''new'' best friend?! And you gave her my B.F.F. bracelet?!
:'''Bubbles''': Yeah. Because, unlike you and your friends, she can handle my cuteness/sass.
:'''Fluttershy''': You call it sass, but it's actually being mean. I've had enough of you.
:'''Bubbles''': Awwww, come ooooon. Don't be maaaaaaad.
:'''Applejack''', '''Rarity''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. Going cute on me, huh? Well, two can play at that game.
:[flamenco music]
:'''Bubbles''': [groans]
:'''Rarity''': My goodness, she's trying to out-adorable him!
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': Go, Fluttershy!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's almost too cute! [faints]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I can't handle the cuteness!
:'''Bubbles''': Nooooo! I'm too cute for this!
:[boom!]
:'''Bubbles''': Aah!
:[fireworks]
:'''Fluttershy''': Guess he couldn't keep up with my cuteness after all. Thanks, everypony, for being there for me. Even when I ditched you for some too-cool cat who doesn't deserve my friendship.
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': Awwwww!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're just glad to have you back!
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

:'''Buttershy''': [deadpan] Bubbles, I'm bored. Make me laugh.
:'''Bubbles''': ''Heeeeeeeelp!''
:'''Buttershy''': [deadpan] Oh, Bubbles. You're soooo funny.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': All right! I have given savory desserts one last attempt! With soup and salad cake! The frosting is a balsamic glaze!
:'''Applejack''': [chomps] Mmm... Well, this is definitely savory. Good work, Pinkie.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, you know what ''I'm'' craving?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Something sweet?
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry, I've got you covered!
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [eating noisily]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mmmm! What a treat!
:'''Fluttershy''': Delicious!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Sweet as Fluttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': Hey! You know how tough I am now! [growls]
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

==The De-Stress Ball==
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Rarity''': Thank you! ''Merci''! ''¡Gracias!''
:[cheering stops]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Great dress rehearsal. Tomorrow night will be a piece of cake.
:'''Rarity''': "A piece of cake"? A piece of cake was grammar school. A piece of cake was the last thing I ate, and it was divine. No! This is live theater! Anything is possible.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Give us examples.
:'''Rarity''': You could forget your lines. The lights could fall. Worst of all, you could get stage fright. [laughs]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': O-Out of curiosity, w-what does stage fright feel like?
:'''Rarity''': Your legs shake. Your knees buckle. Your mouth gets dry.
:'''Applejack''': [grunting]
:[splash!]
:'''Applejack''': Well, that plumb explains it. I've got stage fright!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': I have the most superb solution.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': More cake? I'm pretty hungry.
:'''Gummy''': [chomps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': Tonight, I'm throwing a de-stress ball. It's what we actors do the night before an opening night. We chill out, get our zen on, and make all the collywobbles and worries go away.
:'''Fluttershy''': This'll cure your problem for sure, Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]

:[doors open]
:'''Rarity''': Prepare to de-stress. Beanbags for your bottom, candles for your comfort, and treats for your tummy.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals] Is that peppermint popcorn?
:'''Rarity''': Peppermint is a natural calmer.
:'''Applejack''': Yum. But I still got the fright.
:[knock on door]
:'''Applejack''': [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': I wonder who that could be. [whispers] I know who it is.
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Friends, allow me to introduce... Chamomilia! She will be guiding us in relaxation techniques.
:'''Chamomilia''': [sniffs] Sweet child, I'm glad you called me. There's stage fright in this room.
:[thunder]

:'''Chamomilia''': Let's get down to business. Find your chill zone. Close your eyes.
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]
:'''Chamomilia''': Take a deep breath in, and hold it.
:'''Mane Six''': [inhale]
:'''Chamomilia''': Hold it... Hold it...
:'''Mane Six''': [grunting]
:'''Chamomilia''': Hold it! What is that? [chomping] Mmmm!
:'''Mane Six''': [grunting]
:'''Rarity''': [strained] We need to breathe, Cammy...!
:'''Chamomilia''': And exhale slowly out.
:'''Mane Six''': [panting]
:'''Chamomilia''': [sighs] Wasn't that relaxing? Now, picture yourself on stage tomorrow night.

:'''Chamomilia''': [narrating] All of your friends and family watching you from their seats. See how proud they are of you.
:'''Applejack''': Hey. I reckon I'm feelin' better.
:'''Chamomilia''': See how disappointed they would be if you forgot your lines.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Big McIntosh''': [growl]
:'''Applejack''': [whimpers]
:[crowd booing]
:[splat!]

:'''Applejack''': [whimpers] I reckon I spoke too soon.
:'''Chamomilia''': I know you worry about tripping on stage in front of everypony.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh...
:'''Chamomilia''': But that won't happen. Will it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [whimper]
:'''Chamomilia''': And everypony, open your eyes. See? Isn't that better?
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers] I think ''I've'' got stage fright. And it's all I can think about! It's contagious!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think I've got it, too!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now ''I'' got it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Me, too!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Rainbow Dash''': [whimper]
:'''Chamomilia''': [chewing] Mmmm.
:[watch beeps]
:'''Chamomilia''': That's my time. Afraid I need to go home, watch my stories, and knit. I knit now.
:[clatter]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Chamomilia''': I'll send you an invoice, Rarity.
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': [whimpers, faints]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [worried noise]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:[shatter!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': [wails]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Rarity''': What's gotten into you?
:'''Applejack''': That's just the thing. Nothin's gotten into me. Somethin's left me. I lost my stage fright!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How'd you do that?!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, please tell us! I need this bewitching brain spell gone!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Applejack''': It's the funniest doggone thing. Now that everypony's got stage fright, I feel less alone. And that's what bein' in a cast is all about, right?
:'''Rarity''': You speak the truth.
:'''Applejack''': The only way we get over our joint stage fright is to do our show tomorrow. And I'm golly-gee determined to go on stage tomorrow with all of my best friends!
:'''Fluttershy''': Hey, I'm relaxed again.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmm... I am, too.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Explains the smell.
:'''Rarity''': You've saved opening night, Applejack!
:'''Applejack''': It was your de-stress ball, Rarity. It worked its magic.
:'''Rarity''': It really did. Now, actors, picture it. The theater gets dark. The curtain goes up. A spotlight shines on... us!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Applejack''': Showtime!

==Mad Props==
:'''[Rarity]'''
::[operatically] Me, me, me, all about me!
:Ugh! Darling, you're pitchy! [to reflection] ''You're'' pitchy!
:'''Applejack''': Let me know when you're done. This high-falutin' updo won't stay up. My character can't have a down-do.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight, your prop list spreadsheet is flawless! It's every single item used in the show organized perfectly!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks, Pinkie. I really wanted to make sure I got it right so the play can go off without a hitch. I included everything!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Almost everything. Technically, this tablet is a prop.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, scroll down to the very bottom.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] There it is!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everything goes into the spreadsheet, along with apples, a frying pan, a mirror, an old bucket, this calculator, some pizza, a wheelbarrow, an iced tea pitcher, a dozen squishy cube things...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Places! Thank you! Places!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oops. Time to go.
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You ponies are the greatest to ever grace the stage, and I know about greatness. Pre-show ritual on three! One! Two! Three!
:'''Mane Six''': [???] theater!
:'''Rarity''': ...theater!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's showtime!

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] It is cold out there. Dang near freezing.
:'''Fluttershy''': [stilted] It is cold in here, too. It has been cold in here for years.
:[crack!]
:'''Rarity''': You want heat? You want heat?! What do we look like – billionaires?!
:[flames roaring]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh!
:[hiss]
:'''Fluttershy''': Awww.
:[crowd laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes!
:[ominous music]
:[electrical sounds]
:[ka-chunk!]
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, did we hook up the stage lights wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Should I go try to fix it?
:[electrical sounds]
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Rarity''': You say you want heat? We can't even keep the lights on around here!
:'''Rarity''' and '''Fluttershy''': [nervous laugh]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What a pro.

:'''Applejack''': Sometimes, I feel like I want to gallop far, far away from all of this. You know, just gettin' out of this here town and havin' a history hoedown.
:[crowd laughing]
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': Uhhh... there's... nothin' here for me, anymore.
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:'''Applejack''': It's like outgrowin' an old coat.
:[poof!]
:[crowd laughing]
:'''Applejack''': You want to put it on again...
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': ...but it just doesn't...
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': ...fit the same way anymore. So...
:[poofing]
:'''Applejack''': ...you have to keep changin' your clothes! Always movin' forward!
:[poof!]
:[crowd laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [nervous laugh]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'd give all the stars in the solar system – the planets, too – to stay here. But we've got two days to leave.
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Audience Pony''': [crying]
:'''Fluttershy''': [stilted] But... But this is our home. What will become of us?
:[poof!]
:[crowd laughing]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't do that. Two days, huh?
:[poofing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasping]
:[crowd laughing]
:[ding!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whispers] Pssst. Follow my lead. [stilted] What will become of us? Nowhere to live. Nothing to hold onto.
:[poof!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's like... It's like all the things we hold dear in this world are just going away.
:[crowd awww's]

:'''[Rarity]'''
::[operatically] Whaaaaat a glorious niiiiight
:[poof!]
:[thud]
:[crowd laughing]
:[poof!]

:[French music]
:[clink]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': [slurp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I declare that this orange juice is the best in all the land! Nom-nom-nom. Gulp, gulp.
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chomps]
:[poof!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh. Huh?
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[prop monster roars]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh...
:[prop monster roars]
:'''Rarity''': Don't you see? Our possessions are keeping us down. We need to fight materialism! Hah!
:'''Mane Six''': [grunting]
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': Huh?
:[thud]
:'''Mane Six''': [panting]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What in Celestia's green Equestria just happened?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know, right? I didn't have "big magical monster thingy" on my prop list, but there it was. In the play.

==The Debut Taunt==
:[clang]
:'''Rarity''': Darlings, applause! Party cannon! Fanfare! Lights! Something amazing has happened!
:[thud]
:'''Opalescence''': [yowls]
:'''Rarity''': You may be asking yourself, "Why is Rarity – usually a pillar of chiller – so uncharacteristically over-the-top?"
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Seems like you're acting perfectly normal. [chomps] For you.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [chewing]

:'''[Rarity]'''
::For clarity, you're daring me
::To tell you all why Rarity
::Is having quite a day

:You see, I—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, Rarity, we'll bite.
:'''Applejack''': [chomps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] What's so important about today?
:'''Rarity''': Glad you asked. I... am going to be a star!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Well, you're already a star to us, Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, thanks, darling. But I mean a star to the great pony public! [gasps]
:[cameras clicking]
:'''Rarity''': I just shot an episode of the number-one hour-long premium cable prestige drama ''Hoof Session''! [laughs] It's about a family of ponies vying for control of an apple farm. And I play Greedenia P. Bitscoin the Third, a powerful land developer.
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow, Rarity! That's really cool! How did this happen?
:'''Rarity''': I had an audition. And I nailed it!

:'''Rarity''': Either I buy the farm, or I simply take it from you! It is your choice. But I will get what's mine! A Bitscoin always collects their debts!
:[thud]
:'''Producer Pony''': You... nailed it!

:'''Rarity''': And then he said to keep my schedule clear. Which doesn't always mean you've got the part. But then I did! I got the part! And I stole every scene!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Well, you are one fancy filly.
:'''Rarity''': Quite true. To celebrate, I'm having a little soiree over at mine this eve to watch the ep. Please come.
:'''Fluttershy''': Wouldn't miss it for the world.
:'''Rarity''': Okay, ponies. Time to get ready. Oh! Don't forget to dress to impress, okay? This is a party where you will see and be seen while you see me on the screen!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': [laughs, sighs] End scene.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]

:'''Rarity''': Make it big. But not too big. Oh, why not? Make it too big!
:[blow dryer whirs]
:'''Rarity''': Too much is always enough.

:'''Rarity''': Oh, thank you, thank you. I'm just one small piece of a very large puzzle. I feel so lucky to be part of the ''Hoof Session'' family. What? A six-episode arc revolving around ''my'' character? Oh, why, I have to say yes. So I will! I'll say yes! YES!
:'''Opalescence''': [yowls]

:'''Rarity''': I would be nothing without you, my ponies. Well, I would still be my fabulous self. [laughs] But I wouldn't have amazing friends around me to appreciate the fabulosity!
:[music]

:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [chewing]
:'''Applejack''': Ooh. I feel like I'm at a movie star's house.
:'''Rarity''': ''No talking!'' Here it comes! Here it comes!
:[door opens]
:'''Boss Pony''': Ah, Greedenia P. Bitscoin the Third. We'll never sell! Good day!
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [confused, concerned sounds]
:'''Rarity''': They... cut my monologue? [wails]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Poor Rarity. They chopped her up and cut her out!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Should we do something?
:[ding!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] I've got an idea!

:'''Rarity''': [wailing]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Go away! I don't want visitors! I don't want to see or be seen anymore! [wailing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [country accent] You're tellin' me you want to buy the orchard?
:'''Rarity''': [whimpers]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [country accent] I said... you're tellin' me you want to buy the orchard? [whispers] Pssst! It's your line, Greedenia!
:'''Rarity''': Hmm? [gasps]
:[shimmering]
:'''Rarity''': You heard me! I am a major power player, and I'm making a major play for power! I can grow your numbers faster than you can grow apples! And that's a Greedenia P. Bitscoin promise!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [country accent] We'll never sell! Good day!
:'''Rarity''': It's a bad day as far as I'm concerned. And I think your twin brother would agree.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Opalescence''': [slurps]
:'''Rarity''': This isn't the last you've seen of G.P.B.! You'll be back! They always come back.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Rarity''': [laughs] That was better than I did it on set.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awww!
:'''Rarity''': Ohhhh, thank you. Friends like you make me feel like a star.

==Flutterdash==
:[brakes hiss]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't believe we're actually here at the Sportacular Spectacular!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm signed up for the hundred-meter gallop, buckball, and hoofball, and—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe we should find our cabin first.
:'''Rarity''': Yes, please. I must unpack before my genuine aesthetic audience member attire gets wrinkled.
:[vroom]
:[crash]
:'''Spike''': It's that one right there.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': So, according to the schedule, as long as the hundred-meter doesn't run over, I can dash over to tug-of-tail, then finish off the day with some buckball! I won't even have time to sleep!
:'''Rarity''': So you won't be needing your bunk?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nope. I'll be in the arena the whole time takin' names and playin' games!
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': You get the top bunk, my pretties.
:'''Applejack''': I heard there's gonna be joustin'. What time is that, Dashie?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Let's see. Apple bobbing, apple shot put, apple tennis... I think I'm still in the "A"'s— [grunts, yells]
:[crash!]
:'''Rarity''': Darling!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Spike''': Are you okay?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no!
:'''Applejack''': Your wing!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Your hoof!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Relax. [strained] I'm fine. It was just a tiny tumble.
:[trumpet fanfare]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] The opening ceremonies!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] We can't miss that! Come on, everypony! Hurry! [pained groans] Ouch!

:[trumpet fanfare]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Welcome, fillies and gentlecolts, to the Sportacular Spectacular!
:[fireworks]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [pained groans]
:'''Applejack''': Ooh. That hoof looks mighty sore.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It hurts, but I-I'll just wing it.
:'''Rarity''': Darling, I think your wing needs a sling.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe we should just go home?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We could always try again next 'tacular.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way! [groans] Think of my reputation as the sportiest pony in Equestria! I am unstoppable! [pained groans]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, fine. I might have to sit today out. But I know I'm totally gonna heal up in time for something. Until then, I-I just need to find a... substitute.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gulps]
:[bottles clattering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This'll do. It won't give you my mad skills, but if you ''look'' like me, you might ''feel'' like me, and then you can ''play'' like me. 'Til I'm back on my hooves.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gulping, yelps]
:[whooshing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Twinsies!
:[doors open]
:'''Spike''': Back from our walk. [yells] Not this dream again!
:'''Rarity''': [whimpers]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] You look great, "Flutterdash".
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm ready to punt that helmet across the starting line!

:[ponies grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whispers]
:'''Spike''': Sorry. Sorry.
:[ponies grunting]
:'''Spike''': Rainbow Dash says, "Don't be nervous. Just run like me. Dash." 'Cause it's a dash.
:'''Fluttershy''': What does that even mean?
:'''Spike''': I don't know.
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]
:[starting pistol]
:[zooming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Flutterdash! Go! Ugh. Did she get my message?
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]

:'''Spike''': Uh, Rainbow Dash told me to tell you, "Just do what I do."
:'''Fluttershy''': What does that even mean?
:'''Spike''': Uh, just try moving those hooves this time.
:'''Pony''': [growls]
:[whistle blows]
:[ponies cheer]
:'''Pony''': [yells]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um...
:[zooming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] What is she doing?!

:[whistle blows]
:'''Fluttershy''': Aah!
:[thud]
:[ding!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is all wrong! Spike, call it off! Just tell her to do what she wants!
:'''Spike''': ''Play how you want, Dash!''
:[crowd chattering]
:'''Spike''': What? I'm tired of going back and forth.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't watch whatever happens next.
:'''Applejack''': Hey... look at her go!
:'''Pony''': [screams]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': She's playing the game like Fluttershy, not like me! And...
:[thud]
:[whipping]
:[rip!]
:[ding!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...she's amazing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's a lot better than trying to play like somepony else.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Go, Fluttershy, go!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [cheer]
:'''Pony''': [screams]
:[dinging]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [cheering]

==Don't Look a GIF Horse in the Mouth==
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:[air hissing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''It's my birthday!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Happy birthday!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I can't wait for her to open my present.
:'''Applejack''': I'm havin' a little trouble figurin' out what to get for the party pony who has everythin'.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles] This is the best day ever!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''And'' there's the added pressure of Pinkie being the best gift-giver in the world! Remember the time when...?

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles, squeals]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps, sobs] My first clipboard! All the to-do lists to be done!
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How did you know?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eh.

:'''Applejack''': And then there's her gift at the orchard.

:[fast-forwarding]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles, squeals]
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] A cowgirl hat sweatband! How'd you know?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I just know.
:'''Applejack''': Oh, this gift is perfect.

:'''Applejack''': And it ''was'' perfect.
:'''Rarity''': Darling, want to take a look inside ''my'' beautiful noggin? I was at the Grand Jamboree when I—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Rarity? Is this a birthday story?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, uh... this one is.
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]

:[fast-forwarding]
:'''Rarity''': [narrating] So I had just returned home from the Grand Jamboree on my birthday...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': A chaise fainting couch!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': Darling! How did you—?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Do I know, or do I know?

:'''Applejack''': How am I gonna rustle up an idea for the perfect gift in time for the party?
:[ding!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'll make a list!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Whenever I'm stuck on what to get somepony, I ponder the question, "What did ''I'' want?"
:'''Applejack''': A nice, sturdy pair of work boots?
:'''Rarity''': I was thinking more along the lines of... a diamond necklace, designer sunglasses, or my great-great aunt's china set.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, I don't know, Rare. Those sound a little pricey.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, [scoffs] Fine. Let's be practical and un-fun. How about a sink? Or a light bulb? Or this fancy mirror?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, that's a toaster.
:'''Rarity''': ''Oh, well, I don't know how to help you!'' I'm not a mind reader.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've got good news and bad news. I developed an algorithm to figure out what to gift Pinkie, but it only comes up with items she already has.
:'''Applejack''': No! I gotta know what she's thinkin'! I gotta get in her head!
:[ding!]
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] That's it! I'm takin' a potion to get inside Pinkie's head! Only she can know what she truly wants.
:'''Rarity''': Uh, be careful. If the inside of her head is anything like the outside...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...it's bound to be a party in there!
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scatting]
:[poink!]
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:[zip!]

:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': [gulping] Uhhh...

:'''Applejack''': Whoa! Ugh! Uh, P-Pinkie? Pinkie's brain? It's, uh... It's me, your old pal Applejack. Listen, I'm havin' a hard time—
:'''Inner Pinkie Pie''': Sweet Applejack, you're not gonna find any ideas for the perfect gift here. The magic of birthday gifts is that they have come... from ''you''.
:'''Applejack''': B-But it's not about me. It's ''your'' birthday.
:'''Inner Pinkie Pie''': Sure, but the gift is about us. It's about our friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Hey, why is it so quiet in here? There's, uh, nothin' goin' on.
:'''Inner Pinkie Pie''': Sometimes nothing is everything you need.
:'''Applejack''': Wow, Pinkie. You're pretty deep.
:'''Inner Pinkie Pie''': I know. Now... ''GO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY!'' [echoes]

:'''Applejack''': [gasps]
:'''Rarity''' and '''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:'''Applejack''': I think I've got it!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''' and '''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': Darling, are you certain this is a good idea?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mmm... I'm not so sure Pinkie'll get it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now let's celebrate my ''birthday!''
:[pop!]
:[fizzle]

:[theme song remixed]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! Oh! I think I know who this is from!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How does she always know?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs, gasps] Nothing?!
:[record scratch, music stops]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Oh! When you already have everything you need in the friends around you, a little nothing goes a long way. Thanks for nothing, Applejack.
:[slide whistle]
:[squeak!]
:[music continues]
:[party horn]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

==The Root of It==
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:[spoon stirring]
:[brushing]
:[pages flipping]
:'''Applejack''': How are y'all not goin' stir-crazy?!
:[electric mixer whirring]
:'''Applejack''': [chomps] Ugh! I am ''not'' a happy camper. Nothin' ever changes around here. A-And it's startin' to burn my grits!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You don't think my super-awesome rainbow bran muffin is exciting?
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, somepony's gotta be up to something. Pinkie, what are you doing today?
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Applejack''': Oh, you know, the usual. Baking a fresh batch of cupcakes, making sure they get delivered, mixing a potion or two together to see what happens... Who knows? Hey! Stop saying what I'm saying! I knew you'd say that. I knew you'd say ''that''! Stop copying me! ''Stop it!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Enough! Point proven!
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, we get it. We're a bunch of has-beens who never do anything new. But what are you going to do about it?
:'''Applejack''': Well, shucks. I-I haven't thought it out that far. But it's gotta be somethin' huge. Somethin' drastic.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, skydiving?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yells]

:'''Applejack''': Nope. Too risky.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A whirlwind vacation to a tropical island?

:[tropical music]

:'''Applejack''': No. Too expensive. W-What do I look like – I-I'm made of money?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A massive immersive virtual reality simulation that you can escape into whenever you want but will maybe cause you to disassociate and become stuck in a creation of your own design that you won't be able to escape from, making it more real than reality?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh...
:'''Applejack''': Uhhh... No, Twilight. Not even close.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Then what? What will you do if you're so bored around here?
:'''Applejack''': Something
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Some... thing.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Applejack''': You'll have to wait and see.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You'll... have to... wait and see!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was harder than I thought.
:'''Applejack''': And I suggest you all get trottin' and do somethin' yourselves. Or else you're gonna be stuck like this doin' the same thing forever.
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [unenthused] No. Please do not go.
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': [unenthused] Oh, she's gone.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]

:'''Applejack''': Hmmm...
:[door opens]
:[steam hisses]
:'''Applejack''': Huh? Hm.
:[door closes]

:'''Voice''': How about something... different?
:'''Applejack''': Yeah!
:[upbeat music]

:'''Applejack''': Hope y'all are ready for somethin' totally different! Hey, y'all! Take a good long look at the new, excitin', not-your-everyday-average Applejack!
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': What? W... What did you do?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... great manes think alike?
:'''Applejack''': ''My'' mane. ''My'' moment. ''My'' mane moment!
:'''Fluttershy''': We weren't trying to steal your thunder, Applejack. We were inspired by your words. You woke us up and made us want to shake up our lives, too. [giggles]
:'''Applejack''': But you could've done anythin'. Why a manecut? Why ''this'' manecut?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um... a wild and crazy coincidence. We weren't copying you. We all just wanted...

:'''Mane Six sans Applejack''': ...Something different!

:'''Rarity''': Well, I don't know what you're all saying. I pioneered this manecut when I did a brief stint on a very fun show about a group of companions. The show I refer to, of course, was called ''Chums''.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm sorry, Applejack.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm not Applejack!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Of course you're not, Twilight Sparkle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''I'm'' Twilight Sparkle!
:'''Rarity''': Please. Even with my eyes closed, I'd know you were... Fluttershy?
:'''Fluttershy''': ''I'm'' Fluttershy! At least I think I am.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, okay, okay, ''STOP!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Applejack's right.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ugh! I'm Pinkie! And I'm gonna put a hoof through the floor if we don't all stop this at once! This is ridiculous! Now we wanted to shake things up and do something different, and I'd say we did that. Wouldn't you all agree?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [halfhearted agreement]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We all got the same manecut. That's about the silliest, goofiest thing I could think of. It's not an everyday thing. Not at all. And I think there's only one thing to do about it.

:[music]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Wow. I guess the only thing I needed to shake my life up was a bit of fun with my friends. And it was right in front of me the whole time.
:[splash]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:[splash]
:'''Rarity''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [laugh]
:'''Applejack''': [laughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Applejack! You're gonna want to be in this one!
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

==The Fast and the Furriest==
:[stomach rumbles]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm soooo hungry! So hungry I could eat a... uh... ohhhh... I don't know, but something big!
:[stomach rumbles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] ''You're'' hungry? I'm so hungry, I'm gonna lick that plate clean before it even hits the table!
:[oven timer dings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, you're in luck! I've got some new frosting recipes I'd like you to really savor. Let them breathe! Experience them!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [eating noisily]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Whew! I ate that fast!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I ate it faster. If anyone's gonna "whew", it's gonna be me!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If only there were a way to settle this...
:'''Fluttershy''': Apropos of nothing, today's the Maplewood Motor Match. Just low-key friends having low-stakes fun. No winners or losers here. Um... it just happens to be a race.
:'''Owlowiscious''': [hoots]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, everypony. Here are the rules. We will all be entering our pets in a winner-take-cupcake race. That's right. We're racing for pinks... pink cupcakes!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh, "ooh"]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Each pony will serve as the pit crew for their racer/pet. As such, you will be responsible for building your car without the use of magic. Just nuts and bolts and wood and cardboard and, uh...
:'''Applejack''': Elbow grease!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mine are the greasiest!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nuh-uh!
:'''Rarity''': Glamour!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Glamour optional, but sure. You can use glamour.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Glam! Maximus glam! Glam-o-rama!
:'''Applejack''': Know-how!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know best!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know how better!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmmm, butter...cream frosting. Anyways, there's just one last rule. Have fun!
:'''Gummy''': [croaks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We're already having so much fun!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And we're having more fun than that! [laughs maniacally]

:'''Applejack''': [grunting]

:'''Rarity''': [giggling]

:'''Fluttershy''': [grunts]

:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]

:'''Spike''': Racer Owlowiscious from Team Twi! Racer Tank from Team Dash! Racer Opalescence from Team Rare! Racer Angel Bunny from Team Shy! Racer Gummy from Team Pie! And racer Winona from Team Apple! Are you ready?! On your cutie mark... get cutie set... cutie goooo!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]
:[engines revving]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Tank! We got this!
:'''Opalescence''': [mews]
:'''Angel Bunny''': [chitters]
:[crash!]
:'''Angel Bunny''': [screams]
:[crash!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] No!
:'''Rarity''': Oh! My darling delicate Opal!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': A little further!
:[engines revving]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's the wrong way!
:[screech!]
:'''Owlowiscious''': [hoots]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are you doing?!
:'''Applejack''': Your dirty racin' got our pets in a pickle! A real spicy one!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, do you think we—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Got carried away and lost sight of—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Having fun? Yes, you did!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's it, Tank! Use your boosters!
:[flames roaring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Owlowiscious! Put that extra pony power under the hood to work!
:[engines revving]
:'''Angel Bunny''': [gasps]
:'''Opalescence''': Meow?
:[engines revving]
:'''Angel Bunny''': [screams]
:[camera clicks]
:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]

:'''Winona''': [barking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think I learned something. It doesn't matter who wins.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Exactly. I cared the least about winning. So you might say I'm ''winning'' about caring the least about winning. If I cared about that sort of thing. [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Which we don't.

:'''Fluttershy''': Um...
:'''Angel Bunny''': [chomps]
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughs] Reigning champs!
:[engine revving]

==Disappearing Act==
:'''Mane Six''': [indistinct chatter]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': ''Cutie Mark Crusaders!'' [cheer]
:'''Fluttershy''': It's so good to have you Junior Trail Trotters with us today.
:'''Scootaloo''': We've been looking forward to this for weeks! Eight weeks, to be exact! Two months!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Hope you have something great planned for us!
:'''Rarity''': I do!
:'''Applejack''': Well, I was thinkin' to give 'em a little agricultural know-how. You know, teach 'em how to tend to a crop?
:'''Rarity''': Indeed.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How about a paint party?!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, yes, yes. I have something much better than that up my sleeve. Razzle pizzazzle!
:[poof]
:'''All but Rarity''': [cough]
:'''Rarity''': Okay, Crusaders! Put your hooves together for Rarity... the... the... Rare!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Um...
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Applejack''': I ain't fixin' to be a rotten apple, but I wanted to do ''my'' thing.
:'''Rarity''': And please welcome my beautiful, talented, humble assistant...
:[crash!]
:'''Rarity''': ...Me! It's me! I'm the lovely assistant.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Rarity''': Now, may I have a volunteer?
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [Me! Right here! Rarity, pick me!]
:'''Rarity''': There in the back! You five!
:'''Applejack''': We weren't volunteerin'!
:'''Fluttershy''': This is why I always stand in the back!
:'''Rarity''': [laughs] I heard "we" and "volunteering"! Come up!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [nervous sounds]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you sure about this, Rarity? These potions can be... uh... unpredictable.
:'''Rarity''': Why, sure I'm sure. Now kindly do me the favor of sitting on this table.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Rarity''': [clears throat] Now, when I combine these three potions... the table will disappear!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [distressed sounds]
:'''Rarity''': And you will all be left floating!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Ooooh...
:'''Rarity''': Presto change-o... uh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Disappear-o?
:'''Rarity''': [tut-tuts] Magician is talking! Disappear-o!
:[poof]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That was the coolest trick I've ever seen!
:'''Apple Bloom''': I reckon I agree! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, doggie!
:'''Scootaloo''': Wow! Where'd they go?!
:'''Rarity''': [screams] ''Where did they go?!''
:'''Apple Bloom''': Don't you know? After all, you ''are'' the magician here.
:'''Rarity''': They couldn't have gone far. Actually, I don't know that. They could've gone pretty far.

:[poofing]
:'''Applejack''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [scream]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': First time in the void?
:'''Applejack''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans, "Hmm..."]

:'''Rarity''': I'm sure they'll be fine. [laughs nervously]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Beggin' your pardon, Miss Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': Eh, what? Oh. Uh, not now, Cutie Mark Crusaders. I have to go and, uh... do a... a breathing exercise. [hyperventilates] Aah! I need a spell! I need a spell! If only I had some sort of a sp—
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Rarity's Super Rare Book of Rare Spells!
:[thud]
:[pages flipping]
:'''Rarity''': A-ha! I knew I could rely on myself!
:'''Scootaloo''': [coughs]
:'''Rarity''': And... the little ponies. Disappearing, vanishing without a trace, netherverse-friend-banishing and the subsequent reversal thereof— Yes! Oh! [whimpers]
:'''Scootaloo''': What does it say?
:'''Rarity''': [reading] "When you don't", uh, "let those around you participate, you make them disappear. Only by including them can you bring them back." But I don't recall preventing them from participating! They were ''my'' volunteers in ''my'' magic trick at ''my'' show and... Now I see.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah.
:'''Rarity''': I am devastated at this debacle! I wish I'd just disa— Oh! That's it!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]

:[poof]
:'''Rarity''': Ah!
:'''Applejack''': Rarity. Fancy seein' you here in the void.
:'''Rarity''': Girls! I am overjoyed to see you! What do you say we get out of this formless void and into a balanced friendship where we all share things equally?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That'd be great—
:'''Rarity''': And nobody talks over anypony else or steamrolls their ideas!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': On that note—
:'''Rarity''': Furthermore, I think that—
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': ''Rarity! You're doing it again!''
:'''Rarity''': Oh. Sorry! Um, how about some gardening? And maybe a paint soiree?
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [cheer]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Razzle pizzazzle!
:[poof]

:[poof]
:[thud]
:'''Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That...
:'''Scootaloo''': ...was...
:'''Apple Bloom''': ...awesome!

==Friendship Gems==
:[clatter]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Fluttershy''': Do you know what today is?
:'''Applejack''': Nope. [to fourth wall] But I think she's gonna tell—
:'''Fluttershy''': Today's the day they're emailing the winning troop for the Finn Tastic meet and gree-ee-ee-ee-ee-eet! [deep gasp]
:[beep]
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': [growls] Nothing yet!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Fluttershy? We all have something to tell you—
:'''Rarity''': I have received it!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': Yes, I have received the email!
:'''Applejack''': You did?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's impossi— Oh.
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yelps]
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Yes! It's right here! And it says, "Congratula-fins!" [laughs nervously] We're the winners!
:'''Fluttershy''': Hooray! [laughs] Whoo-hoo! Oh! When do we leave?
:'''Rarity''': Uh... wha...
:'''Fluttershy''': What are our travel plans?
:'''Rarity''': Well, I... [stutters]
:'''Fluttershy''': What should we wear?
:'''Rarity''': Ah! Yes! What should we wear? That I can answer!
:[zip!]
:[techno music]
:'''Rarity''': Crafting!
:'''Fluttershy''': Perfect! Just as we've woven a Trail Trotters troop from six colorful threads – the threads are us – now we can weave friendship bracelets just as beautiful, strong, and metaphorical. I'm so happy we won together as a troop. I couldn't have asked for a greater group of friends.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Uh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously] Us, too. Yes. We are also happy for that same reason.
:'''Rarity''': Yes, yes, yes. We can show Finn Tastic the magic of our friendship or... whatever.
:[clatter]
:'''Trixie''': Did someone say magic?
:[poof!]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Trixie''': No one knows more about magic than the Great and Powerful—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Trixie! Did you just magically appear?
:'''Trixie''': I've been here for five minutes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Want to join us?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Uh...
:'''Trixie''': Say no more! I'm gonna make the most amazing friendship bracelet for my bestest friend in all of Equestria... Trixie!

:'''Trixie''': Glass beads because of my crystal clear wit. Emerald clovers for being lucky and brave. And mirror beads because my reflection's always there for me. Hmm. Still needs a finishing touch. Ooh! Perfect! Like me!
:[clatter]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Incoming!
:'''Mane Six''': [yelping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah! Ugh! Awww...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, Trixie, you might be confident in the magic part, but you might need to spend some time brushing up on the friendship part.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': First of all, it's not a competition.
:'''Fluttershy''': Friendship is free like a butterfly. That you can put in a jar. Forever.
:'''Applejack''': Gettin' close to another pony is one part. But learnin' about them is the other.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just like with magic. Friendship takes a little bit of time and practice.
:'''Rarity''': It's like... a precious stone that you must cherish and polish and wear to the poshest of parties.
:'''Trixie''': That's great and all for you ponies, but every time Trixie tries to do friendship, Trixie fails.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Just leave it to us, and we'll make you into a lean, mean, friendship-making machine!
:'''Fluttershy''': All you need is... a lot of pointers.
:'''Applejack''': And a training montage.

:[rock music]
:[clatter]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?

:[rope whipping]
:[squeak]

:[zoom]
:'''Trixie''': [panting] Oh!
:[crash!]

:'''Gummy''': [chomp]

:[zoom]
:'''Trixie''': [panting] Yeah!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]

:'''Trixie''': It's finished!
:'''Applejack''': Well now. I reckon that's a good friendship bracelet.
:'''Trixie''': Trixie the Great and Powerful has become Trixie the Powerfully Grateful. Thanks for showing me the true meaning of friendship. I couldn't have done it without all of you. I know now that it's not just about being the best. It's about having the best friend...ship bracelet. And this is it! Now, prepare to be amazed by its magnificence! Ta-daaaah!
:'''Mane Six''': [straining]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, technically it did bring us all together.
:'''Trixie''': Why, thank you.
:'''Fluttershy''': [strained] This'll be such a funny story to tell Finn Tastic when we meet him.
:[poof!]

==Dol-FIN-ale==
:[heist music]
:[zipping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The target is in sight.
:'''Rarity''': Commence heist mode!
:'''Applejack''': This one's for you, Fluttershy.

:[door creaks]
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': Finn Tastic!
:[clatter]
:[splash]
:'''Finn Tastic''': Who are you? Why don't you trot on into my humble home away from the ocean and tell me why I'm the subject of your fanciful break-in? And I'm keeping this. Do you want me to autograph a piece of coral for you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': He's just as awesome as Fluttershy said!
:'''Applejack''': Uh... M-Mr. Finn Tastic, sir. We broke into your trailer because we've been pretendin' to be a Trail Trotters troop. It, uh, got out of hand when our friend – your number-one fan – was workin' like crazy on badges and sellin' cookies to win this meet-and-gree-ee-ee-ee-ee-eet with you, and it was too late to come clean to her. I know everypony says they're your number-one fan, but Fluttershy – she really is. And we'd do anythin' to help her meet ya.
:'''Finn Tastic''': I get it. I'd go to crazy lengths to meet me, too. So, where is this super fan?
:[loud stomping]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Can I meet Finn yet?''
:'''Finn Tastic''': You're right. She ''is'' my biggest fan.
:'''Fluttershy''': [squeals]
:'''Finn Tastic''': Fluttershy, it's a pleasure.
:'''Fluttershy''': [swoons] Mr. Tastic, I'll be frank. I had a whole speech planned, but... Okay! I'll just start at the beginning! Ever since I was a young filly... Enough about me! Tell me about ''you'', Finn!
:'''Finn Tastic''': Please, call me Finn Tastic.
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': They say don't meet your heroes. But whoever said that never met Finn Tastic! You can do no wrong!
:'''Finn Tastic''': Which is why, in the spirit of the transparency I live by, I must tell you that you didn't actually win the meet-and-gree-ee-ee-ee-ee-eet with me. Your friends fabricated this Trail Trotters troop. It's all a lie!
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': Aah! [crying]
:'''Applejack''': Now, why would you tell her that?!
:'''Finn Tastic''': I've learned in my life that you have to live truthfully in order to pretend to be a variety of characters on the big screen. Including my Golden Pond-winning turn as Roger the—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Singing Dolphin! [chuckles] We know.
:'''Finn Tastic''': Trust me. Even if it's hard, it's better to be honest.
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [sighs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We owe her the truth.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah.
:'''Rarity''': Let's hunt her down! Or, you know... find her and tell her the truth.

:'''Fluttershy''': How could they lie about the very core of my existence? The Trail Trotters were my everything. Now they are nothing. With nopony to trust, no badges to earn, and no celeb to idolize, I'm doomed to wander this earth alone and angry for the rest of my days. I'll need plenty of space— Oh. Space. Funny. —to cool down and move on with no friends and no "porpoise".

:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] Three months later...

:'''Fluttershy''': Ugh! I'm so mad! My friends made up every part of Trail Trotters! The badges, the cookies, the hiking, the laughing, the memories! But it was real. I got everything I wanted from Trail Trotters. My friends made it happen. I'm missing my time with Finn! And my friends!
:'''Producer Pony''': Cut! We got it! That's the one! [laughs]

:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [indistinct chatter]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] Fluttershy. It's all my fault. What have I done?
:[door creaks]
:'''Applejack''': [gasps]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': Fluttershy! You're back!
:'''Fluttershy''': I know it's been months...
:'''Finn Tastic''': It's been literal minutes.
:'''Fluttershy''': ...but I needed that time to realize. Your intentions with creating Trail Frauders – that's what I'm calling the fraudulent Trail Trotters – your intentions were good, but your actions were so, so bad. But when we got rejected from the troop, you banded together to give me everything I wanted. The cookies, the badges, meeting Finn. And I've been missing out on it because I was mad. But staying angry was only hurting myself.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Finn Tastic''': You really do have great friends, Fluttershy. Not many ponies would go to these... mmm, dramatic lengths just to make their friend happy.
:'''Mane Six''': Awww... [giggle, gasp]
:'''Princess Celestia''': May I present the winners of the Trail Trotters meet-and-gree-ee-ee-ee-ee-eet!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [dolphin sounds]
:'''Princess Celestia''': And as a reward for great friendship, in spite of less than stellar honesty, I appoint you six as Trail Trotter Leaders for Troop Four-Eighty-Two!
:[beat]
:'''Princess Celestia''': That's this troop.
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]

==Game Knight==
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] What a glorious day. It felt like the sunshine was set to perfection.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I wish it could last forever.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'll just take one last whiff of that fresh air before—
:[wind whistles]
:[door closes]
:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, am I crazy, or did the temperature just drop a few degrees?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ponyville looks like a horse-sicle!
:'''Fluttershy''': Twilight, this doesn't have anything to do with the weather-controlling machine you've been working on, does it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nope! Not at all! [nervous laugh] But since it looks like we're all iced in here for a while, why not have a game night?
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, we haven't had a game night in ages! Let's play ''Perfect Pitch-tionary''! We just need a dictionary, a tuning fork, and a croque monsieur!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What's the fancy sandwich for?
:'''Rarity''': Me, darling! I'm starving! Okay, so what about—?
:'''Applejack''': ''One-Eyed Bugbear''?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Cannonball in the Creek''?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But we've played them all before. Don't worry. I've got just the game for such a random occasion.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I invite you all to play my own original game that I invented – ''The Tails of Canterlot''!
:[poof!]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hold for applause.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Are there instructions inside?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. The rule book comes separately.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [worried sound]
:[loud thud]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh]
:'''Applejack''': All one thousand, one hundred, and forty pages of it?
:'''Rarity''': Allow me. My dramatic readings have been known to add much needed flair to any book. [reading] "''Tails of Canterlot'' is a fast-paced role-playing adventure that can be experienced over one long weekend or several. It is a world made up of over eight hundred classes and species."

:[roar]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is detailed. Even for Twilight.
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm, yes. Let's skip ahead. Oh, here we are. [reading] "From here, you spend six hours speaking in front of the Council of Elders to earn your knighthood." Six hours?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You think it's easy to be a knight? Ooooh, you're gonna want to flip to page 402 for the backstory on that!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, maybe I should go check and see if the ice has melted yet.
:[zip!]
:[door opens]
:[wind whistles]
:[door closes]
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': D-Do you have any salt?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're getting to the best part – "How to Understand the Lore".
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No offense, but the lore-ing is a little boring. Can't we just play?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. I guess I can show you what's in the box.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooh!
:'''Fluttershy''': These are cute. There's one to represent each of us. [gasps] This one could be Rarity!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Eh, technically, those are for dungeon-looting. Oh! Those are building tiles. Don't mix them up!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What if we each pick one at random and just build whatever we want?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You have to be a Level 18 Architect to build things. And even then, it has to be approved by the Council!
:'''Applejack''': Hey! We can recreate the apple orchard!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But there's already a Forest of Pears and Peril!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': Uh, I am no Game Master, but I've trimmed down the rules. Do you want to give it a little 'boo when you have a mo'?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trimming... down... rules?! [growls] ''FORGET IT! Game night's over! EVERYPONY, OUTSIDE!''
:'''Applejack''': But we're snowed in.
:[beeping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': I knew it! Your weather machine!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes. Oh, yes. I used my patent-pending "Weatherator" to ice us in here for a cozy game night.
:[beep]
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So take your perfect weather and go outside and we never have to play my game EVER AGAIN!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awww...
:'''Applejack''': Is this about our changes to the game?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We just wanted to make it the best one ever!
:'''Rarity''': Darling, while I appreciate the drama, I feel we're ignoring your dominion over the weather and the fact that you're using it willy-nilly.
:[beep]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight, you don't have to storm off—
:[thunder]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] I get it. Weather machine.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Should we go after her?
:[door slams]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awww...

:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laughing and grunting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Joust! Joust!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They're... still playing my game? I thought you didn't like it.
:'''Rarity''': The rules might be a bit...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, detailed?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Specific?
:'''Applejack''': Overwhelmin'?
:'''Rarity''': ...much. But once you get to the heart of it, you've created an amazing game.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I did?
:'''Fluttershy''': Now we need your help to storm the castle and get to the tower.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, we're supposed to roll this twenty-sided die forty-seven times. But I'm open to suggestions.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:[beep]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': For Canterlot!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': For Canterlot!
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

==Director Spike's Mockumentary==
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:[splatting]
:[whooshing]
:[splatting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mm-mmm!
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Hello, my pony friends! It's great to be back!
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': Um, forgive me, but... where were you?
:'''Spike''': Rarity! I was at my intensive week-long filmmaking workshop at E.C.C. My film-making class. I got my first assignment. And I'm really excited because... I get to make my first movie!
:[beat]
:[gems clatter]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Darling! You must make a grand romantic Ponywood epic with me as the star!
:'''Spike''': Uh, I was thinkin'—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh-ooh-ooh! You should do an action movie!
:[motorcycle revving]
:'''Spike''': [chuckles] Hang on, 'cause I actually—
:'''Applejack''': Yee-haw! A Western would be best!
:'''Spike''': Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Applejack—
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! We could record nature footage!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's do a musical about six pony best frieeeeends!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Or a sci-fi saga! In block letters – "The Day Before Tomorrow"! We open on yesterday—
:'''Spike''': ''Wait!'' I've got other plans! I want to do a documentary about what life in Sugarcube Corner is really like. And I want you ponies in it!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]

:'''Spike''': I want a real slice-of-life, okay? Do what you do. Pretend like I'm not even here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okaaaay. [stilted] I was... frosting these cakes. Right, Rainbow Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes! You were! [stilted] And I was finishing... a batch... of... frosting?
:'''Spike''': Remember. Documentaries are natural. Just be yourselves.
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers] I'm suddenly very aware of my hooves! What do I normally do with them?!
:[splat]
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Why, Rarity, I know how to be natural on camera. I'm just being me – the real, unvarnished Rarity!
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Ooookay, Rarity. Uh, maybe if you just—
:'''[Rarity]'''
::They call me R-A-R-I-T-Y
::I'm the finest filly, and that's no lie
::I'm Rar—!
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:[buzzing]
:'''Applejack''': These fillies have no idea what they're doin'.
:'''Spike''': [groans] I think we need to try something a little different.

:'''Spike''': Okay. If you would just sit here and speak your mind about each other in a way you'd naturally talk about a friend to another friend.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, hello, friend. I, uh... You are my friend, camera. And I love you.
:'''Spike''': Cut! I just... Ugh. No more addressing the camera, okay? Rarity.
:'''[Rarity]'''
::R-A-R-I-T-Y—!
:'''Spike''': Next!
:'''Rarity''': Awww...
:'''Spike''': Uh, you can, uh, tone down the hooves there, Fluttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': I... I can't! I don't remember how to control them!
:'''Spike''': Just put them down on the ground.
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers] They have a mind of their ooooooown!
:[crash]
:'''Spike''': That's it! Enough! If you guys can't be yourselves in front of my camera, I don't want to be behind it! I'm leaving!
:'''Mane Six''': Awwww...
:[beep]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I love you guys, and I love working here. But that just felt weird.
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] I'm just glad I know what to do with my hooves again.
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rarity''': [yell]
:'''Rarity''': [coughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans, laughs]
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]

:'''Spike''': Well, I'd be lying if I said this was a trot in the park. But I think you'll see that we captured a really authentic glimpse of the ponies "Behind the Counter". That's the title.
:'''Applejack''': I don't even know what he cut together. I feel like we gave him diddly-squat.
:'''Spike''': [narrating] ''Friendships like this only come around once in a while. And if you're lucky, you catch some moments when nopony else is watching.''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I didn't know he was filming then!
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:[splatting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] That was fun!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, look at the three of us working together!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rarity''': [yell]
:'''Rarity''': [coughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans, laughs]
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]
:[clang]
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was really sweet, Spike. You got all the best moments when we didn't think we were being filmed. So what's next for you, Mr. Director?
:'''Spike''': I don't know. Maybe a sci-fi Western romance with a musical component.
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now you're talkin'!

:[fireworks]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Looks like it's pony vs. pony! Steed vs. steed!
:'''Rarity''': Beauty vs. beast! [laughs] I'm... kidding, 'cause we're all beauties.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And we're all beasts!
:'''Rarity''': Well, I wouldn't go that far.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I wish we were playing on the same time. That way, we'd all win.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Or all lose.
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm just saying it's possible.
:'''Fluttershy''': Our friends would want us to give it our all. Win or lose, we ''try our best!''
:[loud thudding]
:'''Referee''': [screams]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sad that if we win, they lose.
:'''Rarity''': Well, ''I'' don't want to lose.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Rarity''': What? You don't audition hoping to be the understudy.
:'''Applejack''': What she's tryin' to say is that, even though we're competin' against our pals, we got to give it one hundred percent! Maybe one hundred and ten percent!
:'''Referee''': [blows whistle]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [growls]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]

:[zoom!]
:'''Potion Nova''': It'll be amazing if these ponies make it through and are still friends after this. Well, got to get back to work. Potions don't restock themselves. [giggles]
:[poof!]
:'''Buttershy''': They don't?!
:[zoom!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eat my dust!

:[chomping]
:[zooming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts] Everything's coming into focus.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Three seconds in the air! Ten paces per hurdle! This race can be won using a calculated game plan!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting] Wow, Twi! You give new meaning to "getting your head in the game"!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm giving you a run for your money!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You mean "run for my ''honey''"!
:[zoom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:[zoom!]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Matt 1''': Fine, I don't even care, whatever...
:'''Snips''': [sighs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gulping, sighs] I always run faster when I plant a jar of honey at the finish line.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I did not calculate for that.

:'''Bulk Biceps''': The final round features the top six players competing in the joust! The winning team will be crowned Sportacular Spectacular Champ-taculars!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You think they'll go easy on us 'cause we're friends?
:'''Applejack''': They haven't slowed down yet, so neither will we. Let's still give one hundred and ten percent. Maybe one hundred and twenty percent!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hah! [grunts]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yah! [laughs]
:'''Rarity''': [yelps] Oh! Gentle on the mane!
:'''Fluttershy''': Yikes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]

:[bonk]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:'''Applejack''': Yee-haw! Whoa!
:[squeak]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': I've never seen friends compete like this against friends. You really get what the spirit of competition is all about. Hey! [laughs] That's me! The spirit of competition!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, yeah, that's great and all. But you got to tell us who won and who lost so we can get back to being friends!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Being on different teams doesn't mean you're not friends. By competing your hardest, you push your friends to also play their best.
:'''Mane Six''': [confused sounds]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think Mr. Biceps is on to something. We came here as friends. We're gonna leave as friends. Didn't we compete as friends?
:'''Applejack''': In fact, there's five seconds left!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's give it our all!
:'''Mane Six''': A hundred and thirty percent!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': [blows whistle] Congratulations, ponies! Looks like you're all champ-taculars today! It's a tie. You're all champions!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': See? Best seats in the house! Huh?

:[wind whistling]

:'''Rarity''': [snoring] Aah! My hoofness. How long were we beauty-resting?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, not long. Just all day. The show will begin any minute! There's the spirit of competition now!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': [pants] Oh, good! Just the ponies I was looking for! I need you!

:'''Applejack''': Now what in tarnation is goin' on here?
:'''Bulk Biceps''': I've been so inspired by watching you compete here at the Sportacular Spectacular. You are true sports ponies. But even better friends. You've shown me that I need to be a better friend, too. Because friendship can be hard. But it's what makes everything worthwhile.
:'''Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': So I thought, "Why am I here putting on a perfectly executed one-in-a-lifetime show when I should go make things right with my own pal/rival Hulk Hamstrings?" Uh, I'm having a flashback. Oh, uh, that reminds me. I-I got to give my sash back to you ponies. ''You're'' the spirits of competition now!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait, Mr. Biceps! Your show!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': No. ''Your'' show. You earned it. So you're in charge of the closing ceremonies. Good luck!

==Part 1==
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [laughing]
:[jazz music]
:'''Applejack''': This is a love story. About hats.

:'''Mane Six''': [grunting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hometown cook-offs are right around the corner! We need this place looking spotless A.S.A.—!
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie Pie? Is this clean enough?
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Darlings!
:'''Applejack''': Huh? Oh!
:[zoom!]
:[splat]
:'''Rarity''': Sorry I'm late.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! Amazing hat, Rarity!
:'''Applejack''': It is amazin'. I have one exactly like it.
:'''Rarity''': You know those days when you're just not feeling anything in your massive, option-filled, overflowing closet?

:'''Rarity''': [grunting] ''I have nothing to wear!''
:'''Applejack''': Mornin', Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]

:'''Rarity''': And I thought to myself, "That's what's missing." I can put on a show with my old west chapeau!
:'''Applejack''': You sure can! She... totally can.
:[door opens, bell rings]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I believe that's for me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Fluttershy''': Ooh...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': That was fast.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Equestria Presto instant delivery!
:[door opens, bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Make room on the bandwagon, y'all!
:'''Applejack''': Oh. Another one.
:[door opens, bell rings]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] I'm a hat pony now.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, what is happening?
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, Rarity, you taste-making, talented trendsetter! You've done it again!
:[bell rings]
:'''Applejack''': All right. Get it over with.
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Ooooh...
:'''Applejack''': Phew.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now I'm ready to perfect my sponge cake for TV! So giddy-up on that cleaning, y'all!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': The TV crew will be here in less than twenty-four hours! So let's make it ''sparkle, people!''
:[squeaking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm. Applejack, I think you've got that window clean.
:'''Applejack''': Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess you're right.
:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Pull up some stool. What can I do ya for?
:'''Applejack''': This big a crisis might call for a double scoop. It's all these hats. I feel like my identity has been stolen.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sprinkles?
:'''Applejack''': Rainbow, please. I love my hat 'cause it shows who I am on the inside ''and'' on the outside.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hot fudge?
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm. But with everypony wearin' the same hat as me, it's like... I'm not myself. [whimpers]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, I'll tell you what I'd do in your hooves. Find a new identity!
:'''Applejack''': I don't know. I'm a country filly from peel to core. I'm not sure who else I can be without the hat to match.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmm... Why don't you just give some other hats a try...
:[fanfare]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...while ''I'' figure out what's going on with my sponge cake? Somehow it's ''too'' fluffy.
:'''Applejack''': Okay, then... [gulping]
:[poof!]
:[music]
:'''Ponies''': Oooh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You look good!
:'''Applejack''': Hmm...

:[plane whirring]
:'''Applejack''': Uh... what am I doin'? I don't even know what to— [over loudspeaker] Fillies and gentlecolts, this is Captain Applejack speakin'.
:[boom!]
:[alarm beeping]
:[sputtering]
:'''Applejack''': [distressed sounds]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoop!
:[crash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': Phew.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aw, tough flight?
:'''Applejack''': I-I don't know if this hat is for me.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I've got another hat that just might work.
:'''Applejack''': [gulping]
:[poof!]
:[music]

:[siren wailing]
:'''Applejack''': Now this is more like it! Excitement! Adventure! Heroics!

:'''Applejack''': HOT!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Almost got it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I said preheat, not overheat!
:'''Applejack''': Hmm...
:[sloop]
:'''Applejack''': I'm just gonna... [gulping]

:'''Applejack''': Who cares about cowpony hats? This new me needs space! [gasps]

:'''Applejack''': [gagging]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So? How's it taste? Good enough for hometown? ''It has to be perfect!''
:'''Applejack''': [slurp] It's delicious. Best thing I ever tasted. I just don't think I'm gonna be able to reinvent myself. None of these hats are workin'. I miss the old me. The hat me. What's a hat that says "I'm havin' an identity crisis?" [gulping]
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': Hmm. This feels right.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aww... [chomps] Oh, no! This fluffy failure will ''not'' fly!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': This... also feels right. [chomps]

==Part 2==
:[howl]
:'''Applejack''': What is life without a hat to wear off into the sunset? A hat to get me through the good times and the bad? That is what makes life worth livin'. That hat was full of adventure and spunk. But this black beret matches the core of who I am now. Dark. Alone. ...French? [sighs]
:'''Derek''': Hey.
:'''Applejack''': ''Bonjour''.
:'''Derek''': We love your whole vibe. You seem like the kind of pony who bucks what all the followers follow and goes to the beat of your own drum.
:'''Applejack''': That's totally me!
:'''Derek''': Whoa.
:'''Applejack''': I mean... that's... [clears throat] Whatever.
:'''Derek''': Cool.
:'''Matt 1''': The coolest.
:'''Matt 2''': Very cool.
:'''Derek''': Want to join us alternative ponies? We're a group of individually minded ponies that think things that aren't cool are actually cool.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, not to nitpick, but acting as a group kinda negates your individual—
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': [clears throat] You know what? Yes. Yes, I would.
:'''Derek''': Yay.
:'''Matt 1''': The yayest.
:'''Matt 2''': Very yay.
:'''Derek''': I'm Derek. This is Matt. And this is also Matt. Weird names, I know. That's our whole deal. Being different. Right now, we're into this super-random squishy cube thing.
:'''Matt 1''': Cool.
:'''Matt 2''': Very cool.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, the coolest. What does it, uh, do exactly?
:'''Derek''': Doesn't matter. Just as long as nopony else knows about it, it's cool. 
:'''Applejack''': Ohhhh. [clears throat] Cool.

:[jazz music]
:'''Applejack''': This here is a love story. But not all love stories have happy endings. [grunts] It's gotta do somethin', right?
:[horror music]
:'''Rarity''': [giggles] Darling, what are you doing?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, nothin'! Just playin' with my food.
:'''Rarity''': Where have you been, darling? And where is your trademark hat?
:'''Applejack''': Got a new topper now. I'm bucking the trend.
:'''Rarity''': Indeed. Do you smell toast? Do you need a smack? How many hooves am I holding up? Never mind. Are you quite all right?
:'''Applejack''': Fine. Great. Never better. Who needs a hat when you've got a... squishy-cube thingy?
:'''Rarity''': Hmm... Mind if I take a looky-loo? [gasps] Oh! The time! I must go!
:'''Applejack''': Wait! Where are you—?
:'''Rarity''': Uh, what does it do, exactly?
:'''Applejack''': Well...
:'''Rarity''': Know what? Doesn't matter. As long as it's cool.
:[zip!]
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Applejack''': Cool. Very cool. The coolest.

:[country music]
:'''Applejack''': I'm a strong, independent pony who isn't defined by her hat or anypony else's. So let 'em wear their hats.
:[door opens]
:'''Applejack''': And I'll wear mine. [gasps]
:[squeaking]
:'''Applejack''': Okay... Where'd all the hats go?
:'''Gummy''': [belches]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling. Hats are yesterday's news, darling. I may have let slip that there's a new trend in town.

:'''Rarity''': Why, Twilight! You say these squishy-cube things are the hottest trend since cowpony hats?! I say, tell me more!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I... don't know what that is.
:'''Rarity''': What's that?! Everypony is talking about them?! I better go and get one! Or a million! IMMEDIATELY!
:[ponies stampeding]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No idea what you're talking about. What does that thing even do?

:'''Applejack''': Rarity, you did all this for me?
:'''Derek''': It's happening! They hit the mainstream!
:[zip!]
:'''Derek''': Apple-J, want to join us on the next big thing? It's teeny tiny tiaras. The twist? We wear them on our flanks.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, no. I don't wanna wear teeny tiny tiaras with you. On my flank. I may not need my hat to be myself, but I also don't need to go chasin' trends, mainstream or not.
:'''Derek''': Fine, I don't even care, like, whatever...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Looking good, Apple-J! Er, Applejack!
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, you're my muse. I don't want my taste-making talents to take away your appetite for being you.
:'''Applejack''': They didn't. But it's nice to have it back. If not to define my whole identity, then at least to have sun protection. [chuckles] So, what are we gonna do with all these?

:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps, gasps] It's perfect for my sponge cake! It's what's been missing from my hometown cook-off recipe!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': What? We can eat these?
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [chomp, chewing]
:'''Applejack''': [gulps] Oh, for cryin' out loud. ''WE COULD'VE BEEN EATIN' THESE THE WHOLE TIME!''

==I, Cookie==
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals] Did you hear the news, Gummy? Everypony's gone, which means you can finally binge all fifteen seasons of ''Good Sweets'' with me!
:'''Gummy''': [hurls]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. Well, have fun. I'll, uh, just enjoy my alone time. [laughs] All alone.
:[door closes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:[door closes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] This calls for "Party Plan P"!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': I forgot "Party Plan P" needs at least two ponies to party. [sighs] I miss everypony. Everything just reminds me of them. Like this cookie Rainbow Dash didn't finish.
:[creak]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Applejack's favorite stool. It wobbles just like her. [yelps] Rarity's lending library. It holds her entire ''Detective Monet'' series.
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Fluttershy's favorite stuffed dog! It's been missing for weeks. Ah, Twilight's Replitron 5000. [sniffs, sighs] It smells just like her, with a hint of burning plastic. If only we could all hang out, even when we're not hanging out. If only... Hmmm...
:[beat]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles, imitating Applejack] Well, looky here! We're back! [imitating Twilight] By my calculations, it's like we never left. [imitating Rarity] ''Au contraire, mon mares!'' [imitating Fluttershy] I'm sorry we left you alone, Pinkie. [gasps, imitating Rainbow Dash] I was still the fastest to—
:[tap]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams] You can move!
:'''Cookie Twilight Sparkle''': And we can talk, too. Cookie Dash is saying she's hungry.
:[tapping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, you got all that from her stomps? Well, since you're here, we can all hang out!
:[record scratch]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, ooh! I could bake you something!
:'''Cookie Rarity''': Surely you're joking. There's a whole world out there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs]

:'''Cookie Applejack''': Wow. What is this life, and who am I in it?
:'''Cookie Rainbow Dash''': Ahhh... Ooh... Who am I?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait. You can't leave. We haven't even played a game yet.
:'''Cookie Twilight Sparkle''': If we play a game, will that mean we can leave?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe? Or we could play another game after that one. Or you could stay and never leave. Games! Forever!
:'''Cookie Ponies''': [growl]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Cookie Ponies''': [growling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps]

:'''Cookie Twilight Sparkle''': We get that you don't want to be alone. But that shouldn't stop us from exploring what's out there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [straining]
:[pop!]
:[fizzle!]
:[poof!]
:'''Cookie Ponies''': Huh? [scream]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ah, you're right.
:'''Cookie Ponies''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The world is a big old gumdrop just waiting for you to take a bite. Or stomp.

:'''Cookie Ponies''': [cheer]
:[door closes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Alone again.
:[thunder]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Guess I should clean up this mess.

:[zipping]
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Welcome back, everypony!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pinkie Pie! We missed you! Did you miss us?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure did! Although I had a lot of fun, too. Got creative. You know.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Half-Chomp Champion"?! You always get my talents, Pinkie!
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Perfectly steady for me to wobble.

:'''Rarity''': How fabulous! You put them in order of my five-star reviews!

:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': Mmm! You're part of the collection now. [whispers] Forever!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, did you get to relax at all?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, I learned to let go and enjoy the peace and quiet.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well then, let's make some cookies and celebrate!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously] Sure.

==Keynote Pie==
:[pages flipping]
:'''Applejack''': [pounding] "How to Succeed in Equestria Without Really Trying"? What in tarnation are you readin' that for, Pinkie? You've already got the most successful cupcakery in town!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Relax, Applejack. I'm doing it because I'm ready to take Sugarcube Corner to the big time! The tech world! ''FILLICON VALLEY!''
:[pop!]
:[fizzle!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You get it.
:'''Applejack''': Oh, well, shucks. That sounds excitin'. And-and how do you plan on doin' that?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eh, easy-breezy.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just like all the best and brightest minds of the business world, I'm planning a tech conference to get investors to contribute to Sugarcube Corner.
:[cha-ching!]
:'''Applejack''': But how can you improve on cupcakes? They're kind of just... you know... cupcakes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, you're just gonna have to come to my conference to find out, now aren't you?
:[record scratch]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Uh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Generating buzz already.
:'''Rarity''': My, oh, my. I don't know what she's selling, but ''I'm'' ready to buy!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, sorry. Should've given more information. I'm talking about my tech conference, it's later today, and it's here at Sugarcube Corner. Tell your friends!
:[door closes]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can I get a quick tech check? Or is that a pain in the neck?
:'''Producer Pony''': Got one on deck.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Glad you made the trek!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Producer Pony''': Yeah!/Mm-hmm!
:'''Producer Pony''': Note cards?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Know it all by heart.
:'''Producer Pony''': Wireless remote? [echoing and enunciating] ''Cup-cake. Cup-cake. Sibilance. Two. Two. Cup-cake.''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Perfect! Investors here?
:'''Producer Pony''': Yes, Miss Pie. They're ready for you when you're ready for them.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [deep breath] Pinkie Pie picked a pack of perfect pastries. Pinkie Pie picked a pack of perfect pastries. [hyperventilates]
:'''Producer Pony''': Everything okay, Miss Pie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can you stall for a few teensy seconds while I... [whimpers] ...''FREAK OUT?!'' [groans]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans]
:'''Spike''': It's okay to be nervous. But you got this. Some ponies and dragons will invest in anything. I once sunk a bunch of bits into T-shirts. And then I realized – I don't even wear T-shirts! I don't even ''like'' T-shirts!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers] I know you're right. I'm just so nervous all of a sudden. [hyperventilates]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pinkie, stage fright is no joke. But we'll help you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But I'm afraid of the audience! I'm afraid of the lights! And my stomach's upset! [hyperventilates] How will I overcome any of this?!
:'''Applejack''': With a montage! 

:[montage music]
:[blender whirring]
:[stomach rumbles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans, gulping, burps, gasps]

:'''Rarity''': Perfect!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals] You've all helped me so much! And I love my new hat! Have to admit I'm not really a turtleneck gal. But wait! Where's Fluttershy?
:'''Rarity''': No time to fret about that. You've got this! Unless you don't, in which case I am more than happy to step in. They don't call me Ponyville's number-one understudy for nothing.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aww, that's so sweet. But I've got this! [sighs]
:[curtains draw]
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [echoing] ''Simple. Elegant. Refined sugar. With a dash of party.''
:[balloon fizzles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [echoing] ''Imagine, if you will, a cake that could fit on the sole of your hoof. You'd probably need a pretty big hoof, right? WRONG! The future is here. Sugarcube Corner's new line of designer cakes are sleek, stylish, boxed, and ready for immediate delivery. I have seen the future. And the future is cupcakes. Thank you.''
:[ka-chunk!]
:[clapping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! Nopony came!
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, we're here, and we've got bits to invest. I've got seed money.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well?
:[clock ticking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers] ''SAY SOMETHING!''
:'''Fluttershy''': Aah!
:'''Spike''': Oh, uh, I want to be your ''silent'' partner. That's why I didn't say anything. I'll invest!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We're partners?! This is amazing! [squeals] I couldn't have done it without my best friends supporting me!
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Rarity''': [echoing] ''So, there I was, opening night, and my costume wasn't done being sewn yet! But, darlings, you bet your mane I know how to improvise! And I—''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait!
:[curtains draw]
:'''Rarity''': Thank you!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And scene!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]

==Lolly-Pop==
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This carnival has everything! Rides, games, and not to mention—
:[loudspeaker feedback]
:'''Flim''': You can even clown all around Ponyville town!  
:'''Flam''': Step right up, fillies and gentlecolts, and see the spectacle for yourselves!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Flim''': I'm Flim, he's Flam, and these are our trademark Flim and Flam Clown-o-Rama kits!
:'''Flam''': These state-of-the-art makeup kits will turn everyday ponies into one-of-a-kind clowns! Why, even ''you'' could be!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Crowd Pony 1''': I want one!
:'''Crowd Pony 2''': Ooh! Ooh! Me, me! I need one!
:[cash register dings]
:'''Fluttershy''': I need one of those kits!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, my, Fluttershy! I've never seen you this...
:'''Fluttershy''': Excited? Exuberant? Exhilarated?! I'm all of them! As a young filly, I'd dream of becoming a clown! Lolly-Pop the Clown! And now's my chance!
:[zip!]
:[rumbling]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''One Clown-o-Rama kit, please!''
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles] That ride was incredible!
:'''Applejack''': [laughs] I know! Let's go ride it a—!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Check out Fluttershy! She's living her fillyhood dream of being a clown!
:'''Ponies''': Yay!
:'''Applejack''': [shudders]
:'''Fluttershy''': Not just any clown. I'm Lolly-Pop the Clown!
:[honk!]
:'''Fluttershy''': And I'm performing tonight in the Carnival Clown Jamboree. Everypony who brought a makeup kit gets to show off their sillies. I can't wait to show you my moves!
:'''Applejack''': I... uh, gotta gallop and go! I think I saw some weeds that need pickin'!
:[zip!]
:[vroom!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. Is she okay?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You just focus on practicing for the jamboree. ''We'll'' get to the bottom of this.

:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Applejack? Oh. I guess you weren't kidding.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, picking weeds?
:'''Applejack''': It's what I do on the farm when I need to clear my mind.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You missed one.
:'''Applejack''': [yelps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just a moment ago, you were having the time of your life. Now you're jumping like a frog. What's up?
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:[ribbit]
:'''Applejack''': Well, it's embarrassin', but... ever since I was knee-high to a pig's eye, I've been plumb terrified of clowns.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That explains it.
:'''Applejack''': All I know is when I see a clown, I want to gallop away.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Good news. Fear not. Rejoice! You have something now that you didn't back when this fear developed.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Us!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know exactly how to help. You've gotta become what you fear!
:'''Applejack''': That sounds... insane.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Juggle these. And don't pretend you can't. It's been established that you know how.
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Hey! I think it's workin'! [whimpers] Now I'm afraid of myself!
:[zip!]

:'''Flam''': It's Flim Flam Clown Jamboree time!
:'''Flim''': Now put your hooves together for... Giggle Glue!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! You look great! You ready?
:'''Fluttershy''': I think so. Where's Applejack?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': She didn't want to ruin your big night, but the truth is Applejack's afraid of clowns. So... she's not coming. I'm sorry.
:'''Fluttershy''': What?! Nope. Nopey-nope-nope! This was just a silly filly's dream. But no dream is worth a friend's nightmare. Nope. I'm not performing.
:[squeak!]

:'''Applejack''': [whimpering] Did I miss it? Is it over?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not exactly. When Fluttershy found out how you were feeling, she decided not to be a clown anymore.
:'''Applejack''': But I never wanted my fear to get in the way of Fluttershy's dream. Aw, drat. What now?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sometimes things don't work out perfectly. There isn't always a clean solution, which – believe me – really noodles my noggin.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ha! "Noodles" is such a funny word! [giggles] Try saying it, Applejack. It'll cheer you up.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah, Pinkie, that really doesn't help. [gasps] Wait. Cheer me up. That's it!
:[vroom!]

:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] Huh? [screams]
:'''Applejack''': You need to go on stage and do your clown thing!
:'''Fluttershy''': So you're not afraid anymore?
:[screech!]
:'''Applejack''': Nope, I still am. But I know that you're just tryin' to cheer ponies up. And I think that's pretty great. So I can try to conquer my fear and turn it into fun. [chuckles nervously] For a friend like you.

:'''Flim''': Well, folks, I think that's the end of our jamboree.
:'''Fluttershy''': Not so fast! [grunts] Lolly-Pop's here to bring on the cheer!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Flam''': Good luck, kid. But rhyming's our thing. Watch yourself.
:'''Applejack''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [cheering]
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:[zip!]
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Applejack''': I'm here to help... Lolly-Pop!
:[crowd cheers]

==Little Miss Fortune==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I can't believe it's the last day of the Crystal Empire Carnival! Can we do it all over again?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': According to the map, we rode all the major rides, so that just leaves the Big Top.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm game for whatever as long as it means more fun before we're done.
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! What does that do?
:'''Applejack''': Wow! It's an old lucky cat machine. I heard if you pull its paw, a fortune'll pop out.
:[click!]
:[meow!]
:[ding!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [reading] "You'll find sweet success on the savory path you've chosen. Your lucky item is a spork." Ooh, that was fun! Now to find a spork.
:[click!]
:[meow!]
:[ding!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [reading] "Your lucky number is... your lucky number." Wow! How lucky!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Those were all so cool!
:[click!]
:[meow!]
:[ding!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [reading] "Life is like a traveling circus. Stay in motion, or the fun will end." But I don't want the fun to end!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't take it personally. It's not like the machine actually knows us.
:[click!]
:[meow!]
:[ding!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Your element is magic, and you'll always stay by your friends." Whaaaaat?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs, squeals] A spork!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': They're already coming true! [whines] Everypony's fortune was lucky. But mine is just a bad sign.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe you should just keep moving. Like this!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're right, Pinkie. If I do what it says, then it won't come true. Obviously I should join the circus!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': If I travel all around Equestria, then the fun will never end!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think that's what Pinkie meant.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't just stand around. I gotta keep moving! Or the fun will end!
:[zip!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Shining Armor! Just the ringmaster I needed to see! I want to join the circus.
:'''Shining Armor''': Well, we're always on the lookout for exciting new acts. But we're about to leave Ponyville.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And that's exactly what I need to do!
:'''Shining Armor''': Well, then I don't mind giving you a shot in the Big Top. 
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm in! Now the fun will never end! Take that, fortune!

:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Shining Armor''': Tonight, we introduce a new high-flying member – Danger Dash!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Shining Armor''': For Danger Dash's first trick, she'll attempt to cross the tightrope...
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Shining Armor''': ...wing-tied and blindfolded...
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Shining Armor''': ...while answering math questions!
:[record scratch]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait, what?! One plus four is more than the square root of [???] of an apple pie-aye-ayeeeee!
:[boing!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:[crash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You always had it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm just not cut out to juggle so many things at once. But that doesn't mean I'm a one-trick pony. There's surely something—
:'''Shining Armor''': Our next event for the evening is the Cage of Constant Worry!
:[thunder]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Applejack''': I'm worried just lookin' at it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't be. It's Rainbow Dash, after all.
:[zoom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They wouldn't let her do something ''too'' dangerous.
:'''Shining Armor''': You're about to see something very dangerous that few stunt ponies have ever attempted! Without using a motorcycle!
:[clang!]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. Now I'm worried, too.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts]
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I... can't... STOP!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [screams]
:[crash!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, are you all right?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I am. But something's just not right. I've gotta see if Shining Armor has any acts left to try. I know I was meant for the circus. Give me another shot.
:'''Shining Armor''': Well, we do have one last part we couldn't fill on such short notice. But it requires a costume change.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Count me in!

:'''Shining Armor''': Thank you, everypony, for joining us for our final act!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Shining Armor''': [whispers] Be ferocious!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Roar?
:'''Audience Pony''': Huh?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... roar?
:[crowd booing]
:[tomatoes splatting]

:'''Applejack''': We came to say goodbye, but why is your frown already upside-down?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Because I was so busy worrying about my fortune, I totally forgot how when we're together, it's always a super-awesome rollercoaster of good times! Things never stop moving here!
:'''Fluttershy''': Does that mean you're not leaving Ponyville?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You betcha!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Step right up! The show is just about to start!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Welcome to Rainbow's Daring Danger Dash Show!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now, everypony put your helmets on!

==Magic is Ahoof==
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Our play went over swimmingly! Exactly as planned!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity, what are you talking about? Every single prop in our Play Day play vanished before our very eyes.
:'''Rarity''': ''And'' I got three consecutive standing ovations! Which is exactly the number my horse-oscope predicted.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Rarity''': [sniffs, sighs] Roses. The winner's flower.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': [yelps] Fine. I promise I'll share.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. No lingering trace of our items. No signs of scientific eradication.
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': You're gonna have to explain to us soon what in the hoof you just said.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That all of our items have been cleanly transported with a special kind of magic... Chaos magic!
:[thunder]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': It does seem to have gotten out of control lately.
:'''Rarity''': This sounds like a case for Detective Rarity!
:[film noir music]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sounds of confusion]
:'''Rarity''': [whistles] I knew a mystery was ahoof when the magic made everything poof!
:[shatter!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh, that's a good line.
:'''Rarity''': This mystery will be messing up our manes no more.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooooh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know you're a one-pony problem solver, but it's always been my dream to join you on a caper.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooooh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Also, I know where the magic first got all funky – the Potion Ocean!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Then lead the way, Private Eye Pie! We've got some ponies to prod! Some Equestrians to question! Some—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': —horsies to hug!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Uh— [screams]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Soooo, uh... wait for them at Sugarcube Corner 'til they get back?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', and '''Fluttershy''': [agreeing]

:'''Rarity''': Hmmm... [sniffing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': You have to feel the evidence for answers, Pinkie. Really become one with the wonders of the mystery.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Or... we could just ask this pony.
:'''Rarity''': [coughs]
:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': Tell me... when was the last time you encountered magic on the sand?
:'''Reuse Pony (M)''': Uhhh, about three days ago.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh!
:'''Reuse Pony (M)''': There he is. His name is Magic. We met here three days ago, and we've been best friends ever since. Yooo-hooo! Say hello, Magic!
:[deflating]
:'''Rarity''': [groans] Bobbins.
:'''Magic''': [yelling]
:[crash!]

:'''Rarity''': Tell me... any magical mistakes happen in here?
:'''Librarian Pony''': Actually, yes. This book has been glowing with purple dust all morning.
:'''Rarity''': Do you see this, P.I. Pie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] We're one step closer to solving the mystery?
:'''Rarity''': My bookmark's still in here from when I turned this in last week. Also... we're one step closer to solving the mystery!

:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': As I conducted my investigation, one thing became crystal clear.
:'''Applejack''': You're crazy for craftin' yarn?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Rarity''': No! But also, yes.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Rarity''': I discovered my pursuit of perplexing magical powers gone kaput was pointless! Because the proof of the problem was present with ''you'' ponies!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': Actually, I was just about to start by saying—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm the reason! I wished for something really big...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [narrating] ...on the Cotton Candy Comet, and it clogged up the cosmos!
:[crack!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [narrating] Now nopony's wishes are being granted!

:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': Actually, I was just about to—
:'''Applejack''': My wish didn't come true either!
:'''Rarity''': Right, of course. But, uh, I-I kind of had this whole presentation made, so if I could just—
:'''Fluttershy''': I was so worried that ''my'' wish somehow messed everything up.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers] Oh, why did I use my wish on a giant calculator that never came?
:'''Rarity''': That's actually what I was getting to. My wish was in the library. I wished for a second sparkly bookmark, and it never came!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. You said the proof is with us. If none of our wishes came true, then there's no jam.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... So ''another'' pony messed it up. But who?
:'''Rarity''': No, dear Twilight. Isn't it obvious? It was...
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': ...''you!''
:[thunder]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Discord''': [laughs maniacally] Oh, it all started weeks ago on a typical Wed-nes-day. I was going about my normal business – a.k.a. wreaking absolute and complete chaos with a total disregard for normalcy – on my weekly stroll. And after I filled all of Rarity's hats with swamp mud...
:'''Rarity''': Huh?
:'''Discord''': ...I started messing with your wishes.

:'''Discord''': [narrating] My mischievous master plan went off without a hitch. But I soon discovered I wanted more.

:'''Discord''': Just wait and see what I do with those wishes! It's going to be deliciously out of control! [laughs maniacally, snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': [faints]
:[ominous music]

==Journey to the Center of the 'Cord==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here are the cold, hard milkshakes!
:[splat!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I mean, facts. Our wishes have disappeared. Now that we know it was Discord who did the dirty deed, I think it's time we got some—
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Justice!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I was gonna say "answers", but that works, too.

:[rock music]
:[bubbling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whimpers]
:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Discord''': Hmm? Please come in. ''Entrez-vous'', my four-legged friends.
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmph.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, Mr. Discord. We've got questions. You've got—
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Finger sandwiches?
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] My hoofness. It's so civilized. But I shan't partake.
:'''Applejack''': Well, I'm too polite to turn down a snack.
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': [eating noisily]
:[zip!]
:'''Mane Six''': [eating noisily]

:'''Discord''': So there I was, clutching the guardrails of this rickety little bridge, and the troll said I had to answer his riddle. So I asked the troll a counter-riddle, and when the troll failed to answer said riddle...
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': ...he turned into stone! But I couldn't move the stone, so I still couldn't cross the bridge.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So? What did you do?
:'''Discord''': [stammers] I went home and listened to a pony-cast about comedic uses for dark magic. Very compelling, actually.
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Discord''': So, my fair fillies, as to what do I owe the pleasure?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. Right. Where might our missing wishes be, Discord dear? We'd really like to know.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Actually, we ''demand'' to know!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp, growl]
:'''Discord''': I'll never tell! Never ever! I must ask you to leave posthaste! Goodbye! [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:[poof!]
:'''Mane Six''': [yell] Oof!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, that didn't work.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe he was lying about taking our wishes.
:'''Applejack''': Not tootin' likely. But I know he's up to somethin'.
:'''Rarity''': If only we could get into that big, twisted noodle of a brain and find out what he's thinking.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Rarity, you're a genius!

:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] We should shrink ourselves down, get in Discord's head, and see what's going on with those wishes for ourselves!

:'''Rarity''': Let's do it!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, it's on!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Yeah!

:[exciting music]
:[poof!]
:[door opens]
:'''Discord''': [yawns, sighs] What a lovely morning. Time to gather some swamp mud, make it rain chocolate... Oh! Look! The morning paper. I just adore the funny pages.
:'''Fluttershy''': [whispering, high-pitched] Fan out! Tiny pony potion paratroopers, go, go, go!
:'''Discord''': Huh. My brain itches. Hmm. Oh, well.

:'''Mane Six''': [screaming]
:'''Applejack''': Wow. Discord's brain is... tidier than I thought. But this maze is still mighty confusin'. How will we know where to find his memories? Huh?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp, scream]
:'''Applejack''': [whimpers]
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Awww. Maybe this adorable mutant bunny can help us. Hello there.
:'''3-Headed Bunny (Right Head)''': [hisses]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''3-Headed Bunny (Right Head)''': [clears throat] Sorry. I had a snake for lunch.
:'''3-Headed Bunny (Middle Head)''': Well, one of us did. Password?
:'''3-Headed Bunny (Left Head)''': "flutt3rshy", but the "E" is a three.
:'''3-Headed Bunny (Right Head)''': Uh, no, we changed it last week. We had to add an exclamation point.
:'''3-Headed Bunny (Middle Head)''': [groans] Not you! Them!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': "flutt3rshy!", and the "E" is a three.
:'''3-Headed Bunny (All)''': You may pass.

:'''Mane Six''': [yell]
:[crash!]
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:[doors open]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, everypony! Over there!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmmm... Huh?
:[poof!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Here it is! A catalog of how Discord spent everypony's wishes!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]

:'''Fluttershy''': [narrating] A million mice, a million mouse traps, more wishes, fewer wishes, the ability to breathe ice instead of fire...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [narrating] ...an apple orchard the size of a planet, a TV show starring me as every character...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...an Olympic-size pool and an indoor gym...
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait! These ones are ''our'' wishes! He took them all!
:'''Mane Six''': [growling]

:'''Discord''': [sneezes]
:'''Mane Six''': [yell]
:'''Discord''': What in Equestria?! How did you—?! What's going on?
:'''Fluttershy''': ''We're asking the questions, buddy! We know you spent every wish!''
:'''Rarity''': Including ours!
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Yeah! So what do you plan on doing about it?!''
:'''Discord''': I plan on... um... offering you another sandwich. And by the way, whatever you did in there, my ears have never felt cleaner.
:'''Mane Six''': [growling]
:'''Discord''': Aren't I a stinker?

==Magical Mare-story Tour==
:[keyboard clacking]
:[clang!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': One quick cobbler to go!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoooaaa! Cobb-ler. This is like a sweet, buttery dessert salad.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I never thought of it like that!
:'''Applejack''': Don't y'all worry your pretty little pony heads.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're calculating a way to get you home sooner than you can say "chronology protection conjecture"! [laughs, trails off]
:[keyboard clacking]
:'''Echo''': Oh, but we're not rushing back to go home.
:'''Sugar Snap''': We were actually hoping to learn more about Ponyville.
:'''Lightning Chill''': Take in the sights... [sniffs] ...and sweet bites.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals] Ponies? Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That Lightning Chill's gonna have a tummy ache if she doesn't slow down?
:'''Lightning Chill''': [eating noisily]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That we should give our new friends an official Ponyville tour!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But they're from the Wild Side. They're used to excitement and adventure.
:'''Rarity''': So we give them the tour to end all tours and start all friendships.
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Applejack''': [laughs]
:[zip!]
:[door opens]

:[beeping]
:'''Applejack''': To the Apple family apple farm!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Wild Siders''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Applejack''': And over here's our pink pearl pack. Over there's our opal orchard.
:[ka-chunk]
:'''Applejack''': And comin' up next is the red, delicious, super-ambitious tower of tasty tree snacks!
:'''Sugar Snap''': Whoa. Is there a chance we can try any of these apples?
:[watch beeps]
:'''Applejack''': Aw, shucks. We're almost late for the cider-tastin', water-paintin' craft corner out in the barn. Let's go!
:[zip!]
:'''Sugar Snap''': Whoa!

:[watch beeps]
:[zip!]
:[zip!]
:[glass clinks]

:[beeping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Picture it – judges here, and me whipping up my award-winning white frosting on a very cozy countertop.
:'''Echo''': This is incredible, Pinkie! It is!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Yeah! Like, maybe we could try and do some baking in here, too?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm...
:[watch beeps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! No time for that! Off to the next Ponyville tour stop!
:[zip!]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoa!

:[beeping]
:[rapid footfalls]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Here it is! The Potion Ocean! Isn't it just glori—? Ouch!
:'''Wild Siders''': [panting]
:'''Echo''': [panting] Glorious, that is. So... glorious.
:[water rushing]
:'''Wild Siders''': [deep breath]
:[splash!]
:'''Sugar Snap''': Ohhh...
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo! Oh, this is the best part of the beach!
:'''Echo''' and '''Sugar Snap''': [cheer]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! Time's up for surf, 'cause there's still so much to see!
:[zip!]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoo-hoo—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And by my calculations, we only have 2.73 minutes for each!
:[zip!]

:[beeping]
:[doors close]
:[camera clicks]
:[zip!]

:[door opens]
:[watch beeps]
:[door closes]

:[beeping]
:[rapid footfalls]

:[lava bubbling]
:'''Bighoof''': [roars]
:[watch beeps]
:[rapid footfalls]
:'''Bighoof''': [whines]

:[alarm ringing]

:'''Rarity''': And now, the pièce de résistance, the prize of all Ponyville, the—
:'''Lightning Chill''': [yawns]
:'''Wild Siders''': [snoring]
:'''Rarity''': Really? I have exactly ten more titles to get through.
:'''Lightning Chill''': Oh, um... sorry for my snoozing. Go on.
:'''Rarity''': The tip-top of the tour—!
:'''Echo''': [groaning]
:'''Applejack''': Hey. What's pickin' at ya, partners?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's like you've lost the pep in your step.
:'''Sugar Snap''': It's not that we're bored.
:'''Lightning Chill''': We were just hopin' to see what you pony dudes do on the reg.
:'''Echo''': We appreciate your efforts to show us around. We do, we do.
:'''Sugar Snap''': We just wanna get to know the real yous better. We think your normal life is totally wild.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But normal is the opposite of wild.
:'''Lightning Chill''': We'll be the judge of that.

:[dice rattling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoo-hoo! I'm in the lead!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, you just lost five points.
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoo-hoo! Five points!
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [laugh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sorry about earlier. We were just so excited to have you in our dimension.
:'''Rarity''': But sometimes, keeping things simple can be the best move a pony can make. I win!
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [cheering and laughing]

==Life of Pie==
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And with one more squeeze... my triple-stuffed glitter puff is done!
:[alarm rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just in time to surprise my protégé for the day – Lightning Chill! Since she's shadowing us today, I thought we could experiment on new recipes together.
:[knock on door]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! She's here! Do I have anything on my muzzle?! I want to surprise her!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Sweet, Pinkie Pie. You really put the bling into ba-king.
:[whoosh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! Duck!
:[thunder]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! Now that's what I call a lightning jolt of luck! Lightning Chill, do you think you can teach me that kind of magic? It would make cleanup a lot easier.
:'''Lightning Chill''': I'm sure we can figure something out. But right now, I'm here to hang and learn from you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, right!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Since you're the head chef of Salad Bowl Junction, our kitchen powers should blend together perfectly to make something the likes of which nopony has ever tasted before! Behold! My saccharine sanctum of supreme sweetness...
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...The pantry! Everything is divided by sweet seasons and treat reasons. In here, I keep my rarest ingredients.
:[door opens]
:'''Lightning Chill''': [gasps] Ahhh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Careful. Bathing for too long in its sweet glow is liable to give anypony a toothache.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': So, any questions?
:'''Lightning Chill''': I'm all good. What should we bake first?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, there's a bit of a process to working in this kitchen. But first, hats! Perfect! Gummy learned everything he knows by watching me.
:'''Lightning Chill''': Oh, that's cool. So he bakes, too?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nah. He just watches. But jump in when you feel comfortable.
:[zipping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mm-hmm!
:[whipping]
:[zipping]
:[whipping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now, where did I put the sugar? Uh-huh!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Uh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And now for a taste test. [chomps, coughs] Too much salt! [gulping, sighs]
:'''Lightning Chill''': I'm sorry, Pinkie. Did I mess up your flow?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No-no-no-no! It wasn't your fault. Just not used to having help. Now, it's time for my special technique. Watch carefully.

:[whipping]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps] Baking pans! I need more baking pans!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Looks like they're all dirty. I can totally wash a few for you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No-no-no-no, it's okay! If you're ''wash''ing, then you're not ''watch''ing. It's time for backup plan B!
:[zip!]
:[door closes]

:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Hmmm...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Quick thinking! It always keeps me on my hooves! And even dirt cake is delicious. So? What have you learned so far?
:'''Lightning Chill''': That you're used to working solo?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, you're right. I'm not even letting you join in. I'm so sorry. Hey, I know. Let's finish baking the lava cake together.
:[clatter!]
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': All it needs is the final ingredient to be added. Now, stand back and watch!
:[splat]
:[bubbling]
:[splash!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screaming] Time for plan B! ''Get to higher ground!''
:'''Lightning Chill''': Sooooo... should I just keep watching it, or...?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, Lightning Chill. I'm so used to doing things all by myself that I left you out. Now look at this mess.
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're so right, Gummy. I really need to mix it up this time and accept a helping hoof. [whimpers] Whoa!
:'''Lightning Chill''': I'd be stoked to help. You know what, Pinkie? I think I know just what this recipe calls for.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sprinkles?
:'''Lightning Chill''': Nope. Just a goooood cleaning.
:[thunder]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You saved us from becoming the special ingredient. Thank you!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Everypony has their own way of doing things. I learned that from watching you.
:[music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Working together truly is the best recipe for friendship.
:[oven dings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And cakes!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Lightning Chill''': [laugh]

==Meet Potion Nova!==
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]
:[slide whistle]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oof! Um...
:'''Applejack''': Welp... not much goin' on today.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What happened to us?! We used to go on adventures! Fight evil! Regale each other with lore!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm... Lately, it does seem like we get into less adventures and more... comedic situations.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If only something magic would happen...
:[vacuum cleaner whirring]
:'''Rarity''': Well, darlings, if you insist, I will sing an aria that I just happened to have prepared.
::Me, me, me, all about me!
::Me, me, me—!
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [yelps]
:[angelic music]
:'''Applejack''': Guh!
:'''Fluttershy''': [yells]
:'''Rarity''': Guh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Geh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': She's... She's amazing!
:'''Potion Nova''': [yelps, grunts] Can't a pony enter a room without whipping up a cloud of magic? Oh, heya, there! What's shakin'?
:[rattling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Me! With excitement!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hello! May I offer some special help to a clearly ''special'' customer? A cupcake, mayhaps?
:'''Potion Nova''': Yeah, I need some help. But not with the cupcake.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't see how that's possible. But go on.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Who are you?
:'''Potion Nova''': [dramatically and echoing] I... am Potion Nova.
:[thunder]
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh. [clears throat] I'm Potion Nova! The potionista behind all your silliest potions!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''You're'' the potion maker?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Fluttershy''': [groan]
:'''Potion Nova''': Yeah, yeah, yeah. [giggles] Anyways, I need you—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Y... Y... You?!
:[shatter!]
:[vacuum cleaner whirring]
:'''Applejack''': Welp. We lost Twilight.

:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! No more potions?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What happened?
:'''Potion Nova''': Every potion uses the same base. Sourced direct from the Potion Ocean. But the problem is... I've totally run out. So I've come to ask you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Say, have you ever considered... oh, I don't know... taking on an apprentice?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no, I dropped my resume! I'm so embarrassed! And also qualified.
:'''Potion Nova''': Um... you good?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Yes. Sorry. It's just... I've been wanting to meet you forever!
:'''Potion Nova''': Me? Oh, [scoffs] Listen, I'm just a simple unicorn with a refrigerator company and a dream.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And really amazing magical potions!
:'''Potion Nova''': Not if you six don't help me make it to the Potion Ocean.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I knew it! I knew we were going on an adventure! Time to get the gang back together!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': 'Kay. We're back together.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then let's go!

:'''Mane Six''': [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Look! A magical bridge! I bet we have to answer a riddle from a troll in order to cross! You! Troll! Give me your riddle!
:'''Stranger Pony''': I'm not a troll. I'm just trying to cross this bridge, too.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Or is that part of the riddle, huh? Huh? [laughs]
:'''Potion Nova''': It's okay. Come on. Excuse us. Have a good one.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've seen this illusion before. Classic trick. The key is to be—
:'''Potion Nova''': Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait up a sec!
:[whistling]
:[splash]
:[snarling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh]

:'''Mane Six''': [grunting, panting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This must be some sort of sinister, mystical, shape-shifting world!
:'''Potion Nova''': Um... full disclosure. [nervous laugh] Not the best with directions.
:[shimmering]
:'''Potion Nova''': Hang on! My mane only twitches when something magic's gonna happen!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is it!
:[poof!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aw.
:'''Potion Nova''': You know, not all magic has to be big-explosive-showy. Magic's all around us. Which means it's kind of normal.
:[zip!]
:'''Potion Nova''': See?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laughing]

:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my!
:'''Applejack''': The Potion Ocean!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Pretty!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's so magical!
:'''Potion Nova''': Nice to see it through fresh eyes. Guess I forgot how special it is.

:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': [slurps]
:[squirting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Fluttershy''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Can I ask you something? If the journey wasn't full of dangerous magic, why did you need us?
:'''Potion Nova''': Ha! You joking? I can't lift all this potion myself. Only got four hooves. [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You just needed some pack mules?
:'''Potion Nova''': Plus, company wasn't bad. And if somepony were... say... to be my apprentice...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles] Yaaa-ha-hay! Whoo-hooooo!
:[fireworks]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]

==Pony Surfin' Safari==
:'''Fluttershy''': Hm.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps] Mmm.
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps]
:[poof!]
:'''Potion Nova''': Hope you're all enjoying the vacay and fun activities! [giggles] Just stay away from the Cute Triangle! Once you're lost, you're lost forever! Okay, have fun!
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': Time for our first group activity – a bonfire! Uh... [sighs] Well, we can't get started with anypony missin'. Be back in a jiff.
:[zip!]

:[crab chittering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Your serve!
:'''Applejack''': Hey! We're tryin' to do a group thing back at the fire, and – thing is – you're a part of the group.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs]  Bet you can't score while I'm gone!
:[pop!]
:[air hisses]

:'''Applejack''': All righty, where were we? [sighs] What part of "group activity" do we not seem to be gettin' here?!
:'''Rarity''': Darlings, tragedy! I can't find my couture sunglasses! Huh?
:'''Applejack''': Oh, I-I think I saw 'em by the bonfire.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggling]
:[snip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': [distressed sounds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [slurping]
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um... [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmm... Should I order a cupcake?
:'''Applejack''': This isn't Food Fest. It's Fire Fest! Now get your haunches outside with the rest of the crew!

:'''Applejack''': [gasps] How the...?! [groans] ''We're never gonna have a group activity at this rate!''
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh, don't stress, Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': I just don't see the point of vacationin' together if we're not gonna ''be'' together.
:[shimmering]
:'''Potion Nova''': [gasps] My mane! It means something magic's about to happen!
:[poof!]

:[owl hoots]
:[rooster crows]
:'''Mane Six sans Applejack''': [snoring]
:[door opens]
:[upbeat music]
:[alarm clock rings]
:'''Applejack''': We're burnin' daylight here!
:'''Fluttershy''': [yawns] Sleep in...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Applejack''': We didn't get group time at the bonfire, so I signed us all up for a surfin' safari!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yawns]
:'''Applejack''': Now let's go, go, go!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Follow me to the caves!
:'''Rarity''': Are there any parasols available? My hat and SPF don't seem to be doing the trick.
:'''Applejack''': Uh—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm gonna go back for snacks!
:'''Applejack''': ''Everypony, listen up!''
:[splash]
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': We're havin' a fun day out as a group. No talkin', no snacks, no caves, no distractions! ''Just fun! Everypony stay in between these three rocks! Nopony allowed outside the boundaries! WE! STICK! TOGETHER!''
:[whooshing]
:'''Applejack''': [yelps]
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:[splash]
:'''Rarity''': Ah! Darlings! My sunglasses!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This must be the Cute Triangle, where everything lost is lost forever!
:'''Fluttershy''': Including us?
:'''Applejack''': At least we're... together?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [growl]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [slurping]
:'''Applejack''': I got a feelin' I caused this. But I might be able to fix it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh!
:'''Applejack''': All right, ponies.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Applejack''': It's been a minute, but if we're gonna get out of here, we're gonna have to use some good old-fashioned friendship magic!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You sure this is gonna work?
:'''Applejack''': It always has.
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp] Whoa! [scream]
:[splash]
:'''Mane Six''': Whoa!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We did it!
:'''Rarity''': I lost my sunglasses!

:'''Applejack''': Welp, gotta admit. Your mane was right. We got caught in the magic of the Cute Triangle.
:'''Potion Nova''': Oh, yeah? Well, I had something really magical happen. I guessed how many gumballs were in the gumball machine at the beach bodega.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And you won?
:'''Potion Nova''': Nope. I was totally off. [giggles] But I was the only one who entered, so they gave it to me anyway!
:'''Applejack''': That's...
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow.
:'''Applejack''': ...incredible.
:'''Potion Nova''': I have so many gumballs! More than I ever could've guessed!
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Potion Nova''': [laugh]

==The Mysterious Voice==
:'''Spike''': Hey, Twilight! You ready to hang out? I got this great new app—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, Spike. I need a rain check. I'm busy transferring all of my organizers onto my tablet today.
:'''Spike''': Oh. Well, I can wait if it's not gonna take too long.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They're my five-year planners.
:'''Spike''': Oh... Maybe tomorrow then?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. I'm scheduled to balance all my books. Look how uneven they've become.
:'''Spike''': I bet some time away from the workshop would be good for you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's no time like the present... for more work! Excuse me!
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">twilight sparkle.</span>''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh? Who's there?
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">twilight!</span>''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... There is no way you're talking to me.
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">but what if i am?</span>''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-uh! If there was ever a sign for a break, this is it!

:'''Applejack''': [straining]
:'''Spike''': Hey, Applejack! Check out this app I—
:'''Applejack''': Heya, Spike! Come and revel in my memories!
:'''Spike''': I don't remember you playing the saxophone.
:'''Applejack''': Never learned how. But who knows? I still might.
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Remember this wheelbarrow? Don't use it anymore since I got a new one, but I can't get rid of it. Never know when you'll need two barrows.
:'''Spike''': You're not using this stuff. Why don't you donate it?
:'''Applejack''': Hmmm... I want to, but losin' this junk would be like losin' friends. Got a lot o' memories attached to this stuff.
:'''Spike''': Well, if you're not gonna get rid of it, come hang out with me.
:'''Applejack''': Mmm... maybe later.
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">applejack! you've outgrown us!</span>''
:[rattling]
:'''Applejack''': This thing hasn't worked in years. [blows]
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">keeping us here is lonely when we could get passed along and make new friends! don't hoard all the fun!</span>''
:'''Applejack''': O-Okay, okay! I'll donate all of it! [grunting]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting, groan] Today is so boring. I've already played every sport, read every comic, and crushed every video game. Ugh. Is this it? Will I just wither into nothingness now?
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">what if you could add a little adventure into your life?</span>''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aah! Who are you, strange and mysterious voice?
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">well... that's... the adventure! sounds like a little job for a certain winged crusader?</span>''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're right! I am more than this! I am Danger Dash!
:'''Disembodied Voice''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">uh... yeah! only you can save this planet from boredom!</span>''

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Relaxing is fun. Relaxing is productive. Relaxing is good.
:'''Applejack''': [grunting] Who can I give this away to?
:[clatter]
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I like peace and quiet. Work can wait.
:[rumbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [screams] Relaxing is bad! [screams]
:[boom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': [pants] My friends!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm...
:'''Applejack''': Uh, I-I mean my friends! You saved the day, Rainbow Dash!
:'''Danger Dash''': That's ''Danger'' Dash to you! But don't thank Danger Dash either. Thank that weird voice that sent me out here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. You heard it, too?
:'''Applejack''': I did! Do you know what it was?
:'''Spike''': [in altered voice] ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">did it sound like this?</span>''
:'''Applejack''', '''Danger Dash''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasp] Spike?!
:'''Spike''': The voice was me. I didn't mean for this mess to happen. I just wanted us all to hang out, and I thought I could help by getting you motivated to finish your tasks.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! You could've just told us you wanted to hang out.
:'''Spike''': Well, I tried, but you wouldn't listen to me when I showed up with my new voice app.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm.
:'''Danger Dash''': Oh... Sorry, Spike.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry.
:'''Danger Dash''': Let's take a look at that app.
:'''Spike''': Well, you kinda already heard it.

:'''Spike''': [in altered voice] ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">twilight sparkle!</span>''

:'''Applejack''': [gasps]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's pretty cool, Spike! And honestly, your silly app helped me out. I needed a break.
:'''Applejack''': And hey, it made me ditch all the stuff I was too afraid to let go of.
:'''Danger Dash''': And if there's ever any danger of being bored, I'll squash it on the double! After all, I am ''Danger Dash!'' Adventure is calling. Feel along for the ride, pal?
:'''Spike''': You got it!
:'''Danger Dash''' and '''Spike''': [whooping and laughing]

==The 5 Habits of Highly Effective Ponies==
:[party horn]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo! Guess what, Fluttershy! I just pulled my one-thousandth cupcake!
:'''Fluttershy''': Amazing news! How are you gonna celebrate?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': By eating a cupcake, of course! [chomps, chewing] [with mouth full] What's this thing you have?
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, it's a caterpillar in a cocoon that was supposed to turn into a butterfly weeks ago. But I've been waiting and waiting and waiting, and it's not helping. What would you do in my hooves?
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': First time here? You've got a lot of sweets to sample!
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie, you're the most passionate pony I know. I bet you'd have this butterfly out and about in no time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here you go! Whoo! Try some of this! [giggles]
:[pop!]
:[fizzle]
:'''Pony''': [laughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': That's it! I'm gonna spend the day as a pony on the wall. Seeing how you do things, copying it, and then I'll succeed for sure!

:'''Fluttershy''': I'm moving about with passion and enthusiasm! Doesn't it make you want to break out of your cocoon?
:[fizzle]
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans, sighs] Pinkie Pie's methods must not be the special sauce I need. Tomorrow, I'll try...

:'''Fluttershy''': Applejack!
:'''Applejack''': Well, howdy, Fluttershy. You dropped in at the perfect time. Can I interest you in a fresh apple?
:'''Fluttershy''': [chomps] Mmm! Delicious! Say, Applejack? What's your technique for growing such wonderful apples?
:'''Applejack''': I reckon it's knowin' just the right amount of sun, water, and fertilizer to give 'em. I also let 'em know how much they're loved.
:'''Fluttershy''': Loved?
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm. Hey there, little apple. You're doin' great. Keep on hangin' in there!
:'''Apple''': [laughs]

:'''Fluttershy''': [country accent] Well, howdy, Miss Butterfly-To-Be. It's your old pal Fluttershy. Butterfly. Fluttershy. See? We're meant to be friends. So won't you come out and play? The weather's dandy. [gasps]
:[snoring]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] I may need to try more dramatic tactics. Tomorrow, I'll visit...

:'''Rarity''': "Rarity"! Sometimes I say my own name just to remind myself how wonderful I am. [grunts, clears throat] The stage is my world. The world is my stage. Oh, I'm sorry, Flutter dear. What was it you were here to ask?
:'''Fluttershy''': You know, you've already answered it.
:'''Rarity''': Wonderful. Then you can be my audience as I rehearse. To neigh or nay to neigh! That is the question!
:[cheering and applause]

:'''Fluttershy''': Well, someone's been quite dramatic in staying in their cocoon. Well, this pony can be dramatic, too. To emerge from your cocoon or, nay, merge from your cocoon! That is the question! And the answer is... ''YOU WILL!''
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans, calm breath] Forget passion. I need logic. And the logical pony for that is...

:'''Fluttershy''': Twilight Sparkle! I was hoping you could help me—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I will be right with you. I'm organizing all of my daily tasks into a spreadsheet, and I'm almost done.
:[printer whirring]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. That's perfect.

:'''Fluttershy''': I just need to map out the days the cocoon has been active, factor in the amount of sunlight it needs... [muttering] ...Yes! Thanks to Twilight's logic, this must be the exact amount of sunlight you need to finally hatch!
:[clock ticking]
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans] "Thanks for nothing" is more like it! I just have one final shot.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Rainbow Dash! Whatcha doin'?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm training for the Sportacular Spectacular! Hard work! Determination! Perseverance! Stick-to-itiveness!
:[squirrel chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hard work! Determination! Perseverance! Stick-to-itiveness!

:'''Fluttershy''': Hard work! Determination! Perseverance! Sticky-cocoon...ness! [sighs] I just don't get it.
:[rain pattering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] Being passionate didn't work. Neither did being gentle. Or dramatic or logical or active. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. All of those things work for my friends. But not for me. What usually works for me is patience.
:[shimmering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:[pop!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Awwww! It all makes sense now. Patience was the right way after all. My friends are great at being themselves, but I'm great at being me. And you, Madam Butterfly, are great at being you! Welcome to this beautiful world!

==One Last Wish==
:'''Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ugh! This madness has got to stop! But wish magic is the only thing powerful enough to undo all the chaos magic in Ponyville.
:'''Rarity''': But Discord took all the wishes!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait just a sugar-frosted second. While we were exploring Discord's head, I learned that today is his birthday!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': In fact, he's ''never'' had a birthday party!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Which means...
:'''Applejack''': He's one year old!
:'''Rarity''': [giggles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, but love the enthusiasm. It means Discord gets a birthday wish!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': That's it! Let's throw Discord the best birthday party ever! [narrating] So he'll use his birthday wish to return Ponyville back to pony-normal!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes! Buuuut we gotta make it a surprise. Knowing Discord, he'd do his usual chaos thing and ruin the party and our last hope.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Much to do and little time to do it!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Rarity and Twilight, you're on decoration duty. Applejack and Fluttershy, you take care of the music. I'll bake the coolest birthday cake ever, aided by my trusted sous chef Rainbow Dash.

:[whir!]
:'''Cheerilee''': Hello and hellooooo! Welcome to Let's Decorate! We make every party great!
:'''Rarity''': We need some emergency decorations for a [whispering] surprise birthday party.
:'''Cheerilee''': [squeals] I love surprises! [whispering] Don't tell me who it's for! I want to be surprised! [twitch]
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah... So we're gonna need streamers, balloons, confetti... Just give us all the best stuff you have.
:'''Cheerilee''': But we have the best stuff! Let me just peek into my storage room for a moment.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Cheerilee''': We're completely out of everything.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Cheerilee''': Surprise!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But you said you have all the things!
:'''Cheerilee''': We do! But not right now. The whole store's been rented, and I must've forgotten. [laughs] Isn't that silly?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [deadpan] The silliest.
:[whir!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What now? We need decorations.
:[ding!]
:'''Rarity''': Twilight, darling, I might just have a solution.

:[techno music]
:'''Fluttershy''': Sorry to bother you, DJ Pon-3, but we really need your help.
:'''Applejack''': We're throwin' a party, and we want to be a real barn-blaster.
:'''Fluttershy''': Will you provide the music?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': Whoo-hoo!
:'''Muffins''': Telegram for DJ Pon-3.
:[zip!]
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [reading] "Congrats. You won a two-week vacation to the tropical oasis of Azebra. It starts immediately. Happy travels." [sighs] Talk about bad luck. What do we do now?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, DJ Pon-3 doesn't mind when ponies rent her equipment, right?

:'''Rarity''': I have a bucket full of old props somewhere. We can use them as decor.
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': [in singsong] Here it is!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [deadpan] Wonderful.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Can we eat it? It looks incredible. I need to eat it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-uh-uh, not yet. First, we frost.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Applejack''': [strained grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Where's DJ Pon-3?
:'''Fluttershy''': No time for a recap! Discord's meeting me here in thirty minutes, and there's much to do! Let's decorate!

:[assorted noises]
:'''Applejack''': [strained grunting]
:'''Rarity''': Props from ''The Pirates of Penprance'', dino gear from ''Jurassic Horse''...
:[roar!]
:'''Rarity''': ...and the aliens from ''Independence Hay''! The party just might be saved!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [cheer]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [sinister chuckle]
:[fizzling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm. Huh? My regular sugar was swapped with my special stash of exploding sugar? [gasp, in slow motion] Noooooooooooo!
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?
:[BOOM!]
:[splatting]
:[door opens]
:[zip!]
:'''Discord''': [grunts]
:[click]
:'''[Mane Six and Spike]'''
::Hey, hey, it's your birthday
::Cheer, cheer for another year
::Hooray for your special day!
:[tense music]
:'''Discord''': What a positively chaotic sight! Let me guess. You want my birthday wish to set Ponyville back to normal?
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How did you know?
:'''Discord''': I overheard you ponies planning.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': I rented everything from that annoying cheeful decoration store pony. I got the DJ to leave you in the lurch.
:[zip!]
:'''Discord''': And swapping the sugars? I wonder how that could've happened.
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Discord''': Surprise!
:'''Fluttershy''': We should've known this craziness couldn't have been a coincidence.
:'''Discord''': I just adore chaos!
:'''Applejack''': I suppose it's so long, birthday wish, and so long, Ponyville.
:'''Discord''': Oh, how wrong you are, "Frappleclack". A ruined party is a perfect party!
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Discord''': Today's chaos has been the perfect birthday present. I'll use my birthday wish to return Ponyville to normal.
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Better do it quickly, 'cause your candle is almost out! Then it'll be goodbye, wish.
:'''Discord''': [inhales, blows]

==Wild Heart Beats==
:'''Applejack''': I-Is it over? C-Can we look?
:[beat]
:'''{{H:title|in Spike's body|Twilight Sparkle}}''': I think it worked! Discord's wish has restored order!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Twilight? Spike? Whoa! "Twilight Spikle"!
:'''{{H:title|in Spike's body|Twilight Sparkle}}''': Ha-ha, very funny. Huh? [gasps] Wait. Why am I Spike? [screams]
:'''{{H:title|in Twilight Sparkle's body|Spike}}''': Whoa! This is freaky! Uh...
:[whoosh]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Whoa. Something's wrong with our portal. We got sucked right back through.
:'''Sugar Snap''': It's like we got... disconnected.
:'''Applejack''': Somethin's not right.
:'''{{H:title|in Spike's body|Twilight Sparkle}}''': Well, that's for sure! Discord's birthday wish should've put everything back to normal, but everything is even more chaotic than before!
:[phone rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry. Have to split for a moment and take this. Oh, okay. And then I said... [trails off]
:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Maybe we can try agaaaaain!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': Bravo!
:'''Echo''': Wow!
:'''{{H:title|in Spike's body|Twilight Sparkle}}''': I'm in Spike's body. Fluttershy is singing everything she says. Pinkie just answered a piece of fruit. I think that the mix of cosmic wish energy and the Wild Side magic is messing with the natural order of Equestria!
:'''Applejack''': So Discord's wish wasn't strong enough?
:'''{{H:title|in Spike's body|Twilight Sparkle}}''': I'm afraid not. Which means our two worlds are merging into one! If that happens, we'll have more than a little chaos to worry about!
:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::This doesn't look goooooood
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [talking incoherently]
:[poof!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''', '''Spike''', '''Echo''', and '''Sugar Snap''': [gasp]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Chill out, everypony. [slurps] I think we can clean up the loose Wild Side magic and set everything right. And I know just how to do it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She's very good at cleaning. Especially glitter. Also, I still have all those weird magical items in the pantry. Sorry, mom. Gonna have to call you back. Gotta go save Equestria! [chomps]
:[zip!]
:'''{{H:title|in Twilight Sparkle's body|Spike}}''': Okay! What's the plan?
:'''Lightning Chill''': First, we'll need those objects so we can infuse them with our magic.
:[rumble!]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [gasp]
:[poof!]
:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::We gotta hurryyyyy!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Coooool! Let's test 'em out!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [cheer]
:'''{{H:title|in Twilight Sparkle's body|Spike}}''': Now it's a portal wand!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [cheer]

{{#lst:Wild Heart Beats (song)|song}}
:'''{{H:title|in Spike's body|Twilight Sparkle}}''': All right, everypony. It's time to end this chaos once and for all!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait! Does this mean...
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...goodbye?!
:'''Sugar Snap''': I think it might.
:'''Echo''': But it's been fun. Super fun.
:'''Lightning Chill''': We could meet again. After all, you never know what the future holds.
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': Awwww...
:[magic sounds]
:[whoosh]
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]
:[whoosh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': Hey! I'm me again!
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [cheer]

:'''Discord''': Just in case these ponies are in need of a little more chaos. [chuckles]
:[crack!]
:'''Discord''': Uh-oh.

==Pie vs. Pie==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Behold! The dough-cup-pop! Part doughnut, part cupcake, part lollipop, all phantasmically yummy!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chomps] Mmmm! Three times the dessert equals three times as delicious! [chomps]
:[door opens]
:'''Applejack''': Howdy, y'all! Check it! Sugar Packet Place is givin' sweets away for free!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps, stutters, gasps]
:'''Buttershy''': New owner special! Get off your seats and come by for free treats!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmm...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Clever rhymes, sweet treats, lower prices? I wonder who this new owner could be.
:[door opens]
:'''Octavio Pie''': Wonder no more!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, allow me to introduce you to... my brother.
:'''Octavio Pie''': Octavio Pie! Pie's my name, pie's my game! Buckball's also my game, but we're not playing that right now. Bring it in, sis!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [grunts] Well, pie was my name ''and'' my game first.
:'''Octavio Pie''': Aw, come on, sis! You afraid of a little friendly sibling bake-off for old times' sake?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] I've never been afraid of a sibling bake-off! Ever since we were little, Octavio and I would face off to bake off delectable desserts.
:'''Octavio Pie''': Pinkie always won. But not this time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] We'll just see about that, won't we?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hate to break it to you, Octavio, but there's no beating Pinkie's dough-cup-pops.
:'''Octavio Pie''': We'll just see about ''that'', won't we?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [stammers] But...! I just...! [groans] Now let the...
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Octavio Pie''': ...sibling bake-off begin!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey!
:'''Octavio Pie''': [laughs] Jinx.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [growls]
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Huh. Well, sure was dandy meetin' your brother, Pinkie.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, it always starts off sweet with him. But things have a way of turning sour. But there's no way he's gonna beat my dough-cup-pops!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [burps] Mmm! I don't know how he can top this! [chewing]

:'''Octavio Pie''': Get 'em here, get 'em now! Part cupcake, part doughnut! An Octavio orig' – the loll-up-nut!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [growls]

:[indistinct chatter]
:[clattering]
:'''Octavio Pie''': You come to surrender already?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] Hardly! You're telling me that you just happened to create the same combo doughnut-cupcake-lollipop ''one day'' after I did?!
:'''Octavio Pie''': Why, we're just two slices of the same pie.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT PIES!!!'' Time to turn up the heat on this bake-off.
:[zip!]

:[music]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Come get the ''original'' dough-cup-pop! Why settle for an imitation when you can get the real thing?!
:[boom! boom!]
:'''Octavio Pie''': Loll-up-nut! Now with free sprinkles!
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] Free unlimited toppings!
:[crowd gasps]
:[splat]
:'''Octavio Pie''': Two loll-up-nuts for the price of one!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''Three'' for the price of one! Beat that!
:'''Octavio Pie''': ''Three'' loll-up-nuts ''and'' a bucket of cookies for the—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': All of that ''and'' my friends and I will personally cater your parties!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Applejack''': We will?

:'''Pinkie Pie''': We're a go with Operation: "Take Back My Creation That Was Shamelessly Copied By My Brother and Sold Across the Street". Wish me luck.

:'''Octavio Pie''': Here you— Hey!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah! It's not what it looks like!
:'''Octavio Pie''': Well, ''this'' is exactly what it looks like.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You took my dough-cup-pops!
:'''Octavio Pie''': It feels good to be one hoof ahead of my sis for once in my little pony life.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [growls]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, you Pies.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': He was copying me!
:'''Octavio Pie''': She came all the way over here!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Octavio Pie''': [yelling over each other]
:'''Applejack''': ''That doesn't matter!''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It doesn't?
:'''Applejack''': No! Octavio, you know you shouldn't have copied Pinkie, right?
:'''Octavio Pie''': I guess...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And Pinkie, you know he copies you because he admires you, right?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah...
:'''Octavio Pie''': I'm sorry I copied your dough-cup-pops. I've always wanted to be just like you. You're so good at what you do. It's hard following in your hoofsteps.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] I see that now. I'm sorry this got so out of hoof. [sighs, gasps] Maybe instead of a bake-off, we should do a bake-with!

:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Octavio Pie''': Come get your sweet-sweet-sweets! Pie sibling originals!
:[applause]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chomps] Mmmm!

==Superb Six==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Listen up, ponies! Today, we're not the Mane Six – we're the Superb Six! Lifestyle gurus and emotional makeover-er-ers. Snips and Snails are coming in to get ready for the Meet-and-Gallop, and they need our help!
:'''Rarity''': "What is the Meet-and-Gallop", you ask? Why, it is only the grandest gala of the year! The swankiest soiree! Everypony worth their mane will be there showing off the highest fashion...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...the best bakes...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...and the sweetest dance moves!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Exactly. So, after a disastrous appearance last year, Snips and Snails have enlisted the expertise of us, the Superb Six. It's our job to make them the best version of themselves. Tip-top attendees! Rarity and Twilight, you two are on fashion patrol.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rarity''': Fashion patrol!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, you're on dance duty.
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Dance duty!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And since everypony attending brings a baked treat, Applejack and I will be their cooking crew to help them whip up the perfect dessert.
:'''Applejack''': Their dish will be the belle of the ball! The cream of the crop! The... the... Y'all get what I mean.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We know our mission – help Snips and Snails put their best hooves forward! "Superb Six" on three! One! A-two! A-three!
:'''Mane Six''': Superb Six!
:[creaking]

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Come in, darlings! Today, we are your personal style guides! [singsong] Wardroooooobe!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And a bow tie, plus a top hat, subtract monocles, carry over a pocket square... By my calculations, this makes you...
:'''Rarity''': The sum of all cuteness!
:'''Snails''': Whoa... We're fancy!
:'''Snips''': Ahhh... That's, uh, different.
:'''Snails''': [grunts]
:[cat yowls]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Hmmm... There! The jaunty angle.

:[dance music]
:'''Snips''' and '''Snails''': [grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa! Those are some wild moves. I can see why you ruffled some feather boas at the Meet-and-Gallop last year.
:'''Fluttershy''': But don't worry. We've got just the routine to help you two feel hoof-loose and fancy-free.
:'''Snails''': We've always gone freestyle.
:[dance music]
:'''Snips''': I don't know if we can do that.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You've just got to get out of your comfort zone. And into the ''groove'' zone.
:'''Snips''' and '''Snails''': [grunting] Ugh!
:'''Snips''': Is the groove zone on the way to the Meet-and-Gallop?
:'''Snails''': 'Cause I don't think we're there yet.
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't worry, you'll get it. Now for the hard part.
:[whoosh]
:'''Snips''' and '''Snails''': Whooooaaaa!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': To really put our best face forward, we're gonna put our best bake forward.
:'''Snails''': Oooh! We could add spray cheese!
:'''Applejack''': That's just a recipe for disaster.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No need to overthink. We're providing you with all the right ingredients for success. All you have to do is add these chopped apples. Maybe I should just...
:'''Snips''': Are you sure we can't—?
:[clatter]
:'''Applejack''': Trust us. We're gonna turn you into tip-top attendees this year – if you follow our instructions to a T. 
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A little bit of this.
:'''Applejack''': A lot of that.
:'''Snails''': Can we... add anything?
:[creak]
:[whirring]
:[pop!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yes! And you're ready for the Meet-and-Gallop!
:'''Snips''': If you say so.
:'''Applejack''': We know so!
:[spraying]

:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We styled. We danced. We baked. And now, we get to see the Snips and Snails of our labor!
:[car horn]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Snips''': We arrived... Best hooves forward...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think the Superb Six superbly messed up.
:'''Rarity''': What do you mean? They're styled to the nines.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But being a tip-top attendee means being true to yourself.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh... We were supposed to help them put ''their'' best hooves forward, not ours.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Rarity''', and '''Fluttershy''': Ohhhhh...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [nervous laugh] Yeah...
:'''Fluttershy''': Time to un-fix what we messed up! "Superb Six" on three!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No time!
:[whooshing]
:'''Snips''': Oh, wow!

==Part 1==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's down to the last three contestants in the Royal Jelly Juggernaut. Chef Pinkie puts the finishing touches on her self pie-trait.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But will it be enough to take the cake?
:[zip!]
:[ding!]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Where'd it go?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': One minute remaining!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah! Where'd you go?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': You seem to be missing a key ingredient, chef.
:[cake screams]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Winners don't lose desserts!
:[cake screams]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait up! [panting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Where's your pie, Pinkie?!
:'''Applejack''': You are jugger-not gonna win without that pie, Pinkie!
:'''Fluttershy''': There's no Pinkie without the pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''Nooooooo!''

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps, panting] It's just a dream. Just a dream.
:[clock ticks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But the finals of the Royal Jelly Juggernaut are ''not'' just a dream. I haven't even decided what to bake.
:[door opens, bell rings]
:[foals laughing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. Good, you're here. I'm foal-sitting today. Except it turns out to be more like foal-chasing. [laughs nervously]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's five-thirty in the morning. Shouldn't they be... mmm, I don't know... sleeping?
:'''Fluttershy''': These fillies wake up early. When they wake up, they're hungry! I've tried everything to get them to settle down. Could you just... help me?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nothing some snacks won't fix.
:[pop!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, thank you, Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No sweat. Always happy to help.
:[clock ticks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh. Still got plenty of time before the competition.

:[clock ticking]
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Foals''': [snoring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Peace and quiet. Whoa. I never say that.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's see. My cake needs to demonstrate who I am...
:[door opens, bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...as a chef/pony inside and out.
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie! I procrastinated for the first time ever! And I hate it! Can I get your help setting up for my film screening and Q&A? We have a ton of work to do before everypony gets here!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Movie screening? Well...
:[clock ticks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's no way you can set all that up on your own.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, good! And we could use a cake. I didn't have time to grab food.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. Yes, um... Well, I suppose we could use this for the screening if you really need it.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A little to the left.
:[film reel clicking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow. Okay. That's actually perfect. Nopony ever gets it on the first try.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What can I say? I work well under pressure. Actually, I gotta go! [yells]
:[zip!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whew. Finally. Time to get my work done.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughing] Pinkie...?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Are you okay?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughs] Just a... a little under the weather. But I-I'm fine. D-Don't worry about me.
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! Let me get you some soup.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, you shouldn't. Unless it's not too much trouble?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] No trouble at all. Happy to help. Anything for a friend in need. Should only take a sec, and then I'll just make up my recipe when I get to the studio.

:[clock ticking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [slurps, snoring]
:[clock ticks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah! I gotta get out of here!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': All tucked in! Now mommy— ooh, I mean, Pinkie can get to the TV studio and figure out what my winning cake will be! ''Live!''
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, don't jet off just yet. I need your opinion.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': On...?
:'''Rarity''': The renovations for Sugarcube Corner. I just need your picks for the tiles, the paint, the floor, the backsplash, the counter, the fridge, the—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Is now really the time? [laughs nervously]
:'''Rarity''': Should just take a moment.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Sure. Still got time. [gritting] Not much, but some.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah!
:'''Applejack''': [straining] Pinkie! Finally! Can you help me get these chairs out to make room for Rarity's new ones?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, uh, I want to help, but I—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But now there's nowhere for my guests to sit!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, well, we could just—
:'''Rarity''': Don't look at me, darling. You haven't even decided on the color palette!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Okay, okay, okay! How about... black?
:'''Rarity''': Black isn't a color! It's the absence of color! [whimpers]
:'''Applejack''': Great. Another couch I'm gonna have to move all by myself.
:[foals laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We could just run away together...
:'''Applejack''': I know I make it look easy, but movin' furniture is hard!
:'''Rarity''': How long was I out?
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie, can you stop them? I...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This isn't for entertainment! It's educational!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [strains] How am I supposed to get everything done?!
:[alarm clock rings]

==Part 2==
:[various commotion]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''EVERYPONY, QUIET!''
:[beep!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Go for Pie!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Pinkie, where in Equestria are you?! It's mere minutes before we start filming the finale!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry! I'll be right there! Just gotta wrap up a few things!
:[beep!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no! The Royal Jelly Juggernaut finale!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We got so caught up in our own stuff, we forgot your competition!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry, Pinkie! We'll get you there in time! You're gonna win this thing, even if it takes all of us to make it happen!
:'''Rarity''': Let's go, fillies! Not a moment to lose!
:[zip!]
:[rumble]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aah! Oof! [laughs nervously] We don't have much time. We're gonna have to split up the work. Each of you needs to make a layer of cake if we're gonna finish before the buzzer.
:'''Applejack''': I'll do my specialty.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Apple spice?
:'''Applejack''': Carrot cake!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Perf! Rarity, can you make your maroon velvet?
:'''Rarity''': Chef, yes, chef!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughs] I've always made a mean confetti cake.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not a chance, young sickling. Let's give those hooves a hot, soapy scrub. Then I'll tackle my family's famous chocolate cake.
:[blender whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Fluttershy, can you do an angel food cake layer?
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm more of a devil's food cake kind of gal. But I'm happy to help out however I can.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And I'll get started on the outside of this cake!

:[whirring]
:'''[Applejack]'''
::Three cups of flour, fourteen carrots
::Cinnamon and butter, bakin' powder, brown sugar
::And a hint of fall
:Are we gonna get this all done in time?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Time to shine by slowing down— [coughs] ...time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''There's no time to stop time!''
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whew. Honestly, I didn't have the energy.
:'''Rarity''': Hmm.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ohhhh! [shatters] Keep it together, Twi. Don't fall to pieces when your friends need you most.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [gasps] Beautiful! Tell us. What makes this cake a representation of you, Chef Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Even though I'm a hundred thousand million percent sprinkles and pink and pep on the outside, I'm lucky enough to have the love and support of these five ponies. Their friendship truly makes me who I am on the inside. Just like each of these layers of cake. I wouldn't be Pinkie Pie without them.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [gulping] Mmm! Delicious! This may be the best cake I've ever tasted! And the metaphor for your friendship is perfect! There's just one thing. You're disqualified.
:[music winds down]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''WHAT?!''
:'''Princess Celestia''': This is an individual competition, not a group one.
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''TV Producer Pony''': I love live television! [laughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why didn't anypony stop us?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': This sign has been here every day.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers]
:'''TV Producer Pony''': You had this whole beautiful "friends supporting each other" thing going on, I didn't have the heart to stop you.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I'm sorry, Pinkie. You're out of the Royal Jelly Juggernaut!
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]

:'''Applejack''': Smells good. What'cha makin'?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Chocolate soup.
:'''Applejack''': Oh, wow. Uh, very nice. Very cool. [laughs nervously] It, uh, looks like melted chocolate chips with some sprinkles thrown in there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''You got a problem with that?!'' Sorry. The soup will help calm me down.
:'''Applejack''': [slurps] Wow. Really does pick you right up out of the blues.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie, we feel awful.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We're just so used to you helping us out, no questions asked.
:'''Rarity''': We didn't even stop to consider that you had more than enough on your plate. Literally.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's okay. I need to do a better job of putting myself first.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Taking care of yourself first is important. That way, you have something left in the tank to help out the ones you love. [coughs]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Go home and rest!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But you need me here! I... Ohhhh, wait. Yeah, I see what I did there.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Uh-huh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughing]
:[spraying]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh? [reading] "You are cordially invited to the ''Royal Jelly Juggernaut: All-Star Chefs'' spin-off!"
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''EVERYPONY, OUT! PINKIE'S GOT WORK TO DO!''
:'''Applejack''': Yee-haw!
:'''Fluttershy''': Yay!
:'''Rarity''': Darlings, let the master work!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Redemption in the kitchen!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now skedaddle so I can start on a brand new recipe! This one's gonna take some time to be camera-ready! J.K., don't skedaddle yet!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', and '''Fluttershy''': Mmmm!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Now skedaddle! For real! [scatting] Yeah!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [screaming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [screaming, groans] Where are we?
:[techno music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think we're in Ponyville anymore. [yelps]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, okay. Take me to your leader! [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Fluttershy?!
:'''Fluttershy''': [grunting]
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait! If we're gonna rescue Fluttershy, we have to be strategic.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But did you see that robot mind control helmet?! They're trying to make her into one of them!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All the more reason to have a plan. I think if we—
:[beeping]
:'''Pulverizer''' and '''Natalie''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">two more unidentified ponies located. commencing.</span>
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers]
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [scream, pant, yelp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not one step closer, you big metallic monsters!
:'''Pulverizer''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">monsters?</span>
:'''Pulverizer''' and '''Natalie''': [laugh robotically]
:'''Natalie''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">we are mecha-ponies, not monsters. i am a mobile atlas protection sentinel. but you can call me natalie.</span>
:'''Pulverizer''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">and i'm ''the pulverizer!'' warning – i'm a hug machine.</span>
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm Twilight Sparkle. And she's Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grumbles]
:'''Natalie''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">we did not mean to alarm you. we wanted to help.</span>
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Like how those other mecha-ponies "helped" our friend by pony-napping her?!
:'''Pulverizer''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">oh, nanos. a mecha-pony would never.</span>
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. We must've been mistaken. Maybe one of you could help clear things up by taking us to Fluttershy?
:'''Natalie''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">scanning for fluttershy. fluttershy found. location – sucrose quadrant.</span>
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'll believe it when I see her.

:'''Natalie''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">turn left on saccharine street.</span>
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Twilight, this is so obviously a trick. Look at them. They're big, shiny, metal, robo-pony-bots who—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Who are actually pretty friendly. Let's give them a chance. We need to find Fluttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': Help!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': Help! I'm stuck!
:[zip!]
:[beeping]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I knew it! This ''is'' a trap!
:'''Pulverizer''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">oh, sorry. some mecha-pony must have tripped on the circuit.</span>
:[click]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. This is Sugarcube Corner.
:'''Pulverizer''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">we know it as sucrose quadrant. owned and operated by q-t-pie.</span>
:'''Q-T-Pie''': [giggling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Sucrose"? "Sugarcube"? Wow! Whoa! It's almost the same on the inside!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, help! Help!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fluttershy! I'm coming!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oof! [groans] Oh, no! I'm too late! They've made you into their mecha-pony queen!
:'''Fluttershy''': Rainbow Dash! Did you come to play, too? This V.R. game feels so real.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You mean you haven't been assimilated yet? What about their leader?
:'''Fluttershy''': The leaderboard for this game is great. I bet you could get first place like Twilight did.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [eating noisily] Oh, there you are! These computer chip cookies are so good! [eating noisily]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So you weren't pony-napped?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] Uh-uh.
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oops.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm sorry I was so quick to judge you based off the way you look. Just because a mecha-pony is scary on the outside doesn't mean you're scary on the inside.
:'''Natalie''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">affirmative. friends?</span>
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groaning] Ugh! [strained] Yup. A real hug machine.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Fluttershy''': [laugh]

:'''Pulverizer''': <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">the ts-83.</span>
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hushed] It's my calculator. I think we need it to get back home. But they think it's a game. What are we gonna do?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't worry. I have a plan. Sorry, Pulverizer. That's not a game. It's Twilight's calculator.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles nervously]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Do you think we could have it back?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's right. My plan was just to ask.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Brilliant move. Looks like our next one should be to head home.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': My hoofness! We're eleven minutes late to open the shop!
:[zip!]

:[keys jingling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope. Uh, nope. Nope. Did the portal warp all my keys? Can somepony go around back and check the gate?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, wait a minute. What is this?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Salad Bowl Junction? What happened to Sugarcube Corner? It's a healthy food restaurant now? They... [gasps] ...don't even have dessert options?!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[pop!]
:[poof!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Something fishy is going on. We'd better do some investi—
:'''Rarity''': Yes?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...-gating.

:'''Reuse Pony''': Yeah, no, I heard you. I just don't think the deal is worth signing. Sure, the perks are nice, but—

:'''Lightning Chill''': Welcome to Salad Bowl Junction.
:[squirrel chitters]
:'''Lightning Chill''': What can I get tossin' for ya? Our salad special today is called "Sprout, Sprout, Let It All Out".
:[squirrel belches]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ugh! This is ''my'' shop! We sell cupcakes!
:'''Lightning Chill''': Uh, no, cupcake. This here is ''my'' shop. And we sell salads.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Lightning Chill''': [laughs] I'm just kidding.
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Lightning Chill''': Chill, chill. I'm sorry. You ponies looked so mad. Please sit down. Zen out.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, we don't know what you're talking about. We want answers!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Yeah!
:[thunder]
:'''Lightning Chill''': I'm Lightning Chill. And these are my friends Echo... (Echo) ...and Sugar Snap. We have all kinds of answers.
:'''Rarity''': Goodness. Look at your style. Aren't you three just a walk on the wild side?
:'''Lightning Chill''': Are we wild? So I've seen wilder. So what's goin' on? What can we do you for?
:'''Echo''': Tell us everything, and maybe we can help. We're helpers!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, well, you might want to sit down. It's a looooong story. It all started when I was...
:[fast-forwarding]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Well, that was quite a pony tale. If you're looking for a portal, we'll help you look. But first, you gotta try one of our salads.
:'''Mane Six''': Uh...

:'''Fluttershy''': [chomps] Mmm. This is actually pretty good.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [munching] Try some, Pinkie.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I can't! It's just too salad-y! Ugh!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, that's your mixing bowl!
:'''Echo''': It wants you to try the salad! ...I think.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers] Ahhhh... [gasps] I can't believe it. It's... delicious!

:[shaking]
:'''Applejack''': Those look delicious, Pinkie Pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hold on! A spritz of sweet cream will make it even splendider.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [slurping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yells] Hold your horses!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps, yelps]
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I made toffee cupcake toppers for each and every one. Well? What are you waiting for? Drink it up before they melt.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [slurp]
:'''Applejack''': [gulps] Pinkie Pie, these milkshakes sure are the motor to my mosey.
:'''Fluttershy''': But what's the special occasion?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] You mean you ponies forgot?!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] We're hosting Ponyville Play Day this year!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ohhhh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The holiday created to mark the one day that's furthest from all the other holidays.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Last year, when Trixie hosted it, it was amazingly incredible!

:'''Fluttershy''': This year, we have to make ours even better!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Especially since the Wild Siders are here.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe I can serve up some of my monster milkshakes!
:[milkshake growls]
:'''Rarity''': Or maybe, for ''Play'' Day, we should actually put on a play!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Rarity''': The pressure's on! What play shall we pick to perform?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! Something heavy on the prop comedy? [chomps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Or one scientifically proven to spark super-fun celebration?
:'''Rarity''': Or a multi-part melodrama with a cast of at least twelve!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But, Rarity, we're only six ponies.
:'''Rarity''': All right, you've twisted my hoof. I'll play seven roles myself!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sounds of excitement]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know! Let's pitch our plays to the Wild Siders, and ''they'll'' decide!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good evening, Wild Siders. May I present... the Mane Six!
:'''Wild Siders''': [cheer]
:'''Applejack''': Welcome to Ponyville Play Day! Where each day is met with a rootin'-tootin' rhythm! Hit it!
:[piano playing]
:'''[Applejack]'''
::[singing]
::I am a pony, and it's my day to play
::I say "hooray", for it's Play Day!
::Yay!

:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But wait! There's more!
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting] This is going to be... [gasps] ...a stage adaptation of... [gasps] ...the true story of... [gasps] ...the fastest pony in Ponyville! [panting]
:[crash!]
:'''Wild Siders''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': Not so fast, ponies. This very special production will be performed... in the round! That means both the stage and the audience are the stage!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': I shall be playing Pon-tine, the innocent daughter of the banker. [deep voice] And I'll also be playing Pon-tiffe, the banker.
:[splat!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's all well and good, ponies. But what this play really needs is some sweet, sweet slapstick.
:[splat!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps] Mmmm! [eating noisily, gulps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, you're making a mess. How are we gonna clean this before my Play Day presentation about important topics? Like the stars in our solar system and... and... other serious stuff!
:'''Applejack''': Or my holiday history hoedown honoring the Play Day tradition?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting, groans]
:[French music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Your play's... about a box?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': It's a play about multiple boxes?
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] It's a play about the Ponyville bicentennial and the founding of our town through the eyes of its original members.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, mm-hmm. That was my next guess. But, [terse laugh] back to ''my'' play.
:'''Mane Six''': [arguing]
:'''Lightning Chill''': Hey, hey, hey, hey! Chill out, pony dudes! What are you even arguing about? This play's already got it all. The beginning with the musical...
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles]
:'''Sugar Snap''': The melodrama in the middle...
:'''Rarity''': [giggles]
:'''Echo''': The pies! Comedy pies!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Lightning Chill''': It's like six gnarly plays in one. Like some kind of hip super-play!
:'''Applejack''': Wow. I hadn't even thought of that.
:'''Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chewing]
:[French music]
:'''Echo''': Huh?
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [sounds of confusion]
:'''Fluttershy''': A perfect depiction of the strengths of our friendships and our Ponyville town pride.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ohhhh.
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [laughing]

==The Shows Must Go On==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm. Paint – check. 
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting]
:'''Rarity''': Props – check. Hmmm. Have you seen my teapot?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe we left it behind.
:'''Rarity''': As the lead star in ''A Neigh in the Life'', I must have my teapot.
:'''Applejack''': I reckon we should double-check the wagon then.

:[clattering]
:'''Rarity''': Ah, there you are. Wait. Is that a crack?! Alas, poor teapot! I knew you well! You hath brewed for me a thousand times, and now—! Oh, wait. It was just lint.
:'''Curtain Call''': [clapping]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Curtain Call''': That... was... great. Listen, Verity – that's your name, right?
:'''Rarity''': [muffles]
:'''Curtain Call''': I've been looking for a grand actress like yourself to perform in my new stage show ''I Trot Along''.
:'''Rarity''': [babbles]
:'''Assistant''': Curtain Call, you're needed on stage!
:'''Curtain Call''': That's my cue. You're going to be the best "Tree Number Two" there is, Clarity! See you at rehearsal!
:'''Fluttershy''': Need a hoof finding your teapot?
:'''Rarity''': Did you know Curtain Call, Applewood director extraordinaire, is here to debut his new play?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah. They're in the theater right across from us.
:'''Rarity''': And he wants ''me'' to play a part in it! My big break has finally arrived!
:'''Sugar Snap''': [sighs] It's a shame our plays are on the same night. [echoing] Same night... Same night... Same night... 
:'''Rarity''': [whimpers]
:[poof!]
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 1''': Don't worry! Just put on a happy face!
:[creak!]
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 1''': Perfect!
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': Huh?
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 2''': This is a big opportunity that's knocking! So answer the door and say "yes" to the dress rehearsal!
:'''Rarity''': You're absolutely right. I can take on both parts. Besides, how many lines could a tree even have?

:'''Sugar Snap''': Heya, Rarity! Do you think we could do a read-through together before I help with the lights?
:'''Rarity''': I don't think I'll have time. I'm already busy rehearsing for both plays, and well—
:[chiming]
:'''Rarity''': Oh! That's probably my agent. I had him e-mail me my new schedule. Hmmm... There's a bit of an overlap during rehearsal. But [scoffs] nothing I shouldn't be able to handle. I am, after all, an actor.

:[fast music]
:'''Rarity''': [clears throat]
:[watch chimes]
:'''Rarity''': [yells, panting]
:[doors open]
:'''Rarity''': [panting, laughs nervously]
:[watch chimes]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, no!
:[zip!]
:'''Makeup Ponies''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': [panting]
:[splash!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oops.
:[watch chimes]
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': [panting and groaning, whimpers]

:'''Rarity''': From the top of scene five. "I am the tree." [clears throat] Oh, sorry, let me try that again. "I ''am'' the tree!"
:'''Sugar Snap''': You're the what?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. How could I be such a silly filly? I was reading from the wrong play.
:[chiming]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, it's an update from Curtain Call. Uh, [reading] "Charity, congratulations. Your role as Tree Number Two has been extended, and you will now be onstage for the entire play"?! [faints] There's no way now I can be in both plays at once. This big break feels more like a big headache!
:[poof!]
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 1''': Think of the exposure!
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 2''': The show must go on!
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 1''': One of them must happen without her.
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 2''': Ah, friends come and go.
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 1''': But one-night shows are forever!
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 2''': Should we ask her what she thinks?
:'''Shoulder Angel Rarity 1''': No! She knows the role she was born to play!
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': [whines]

:[whirring]
:'''Rarity''': Ponies, lend me your ears! It is with great sadness that I have decided to leave our production of ''A Neigh in the Life''. Parting is such sweet sorrow. But Sugar Snap will be a great replacement as she's an amazing understudy. I will now make my exit stage left.
:'''Sugar Snap''': Everypony's gonna be so excited that I fixed the house lights when they get back from lunch!
:'''Gummy''': [chomping]

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Rarity''': "I ''am'' the tree." "I ''am'' the tree!"
:[knock on door]
:'''Rarity''': Huh? [reading] "Due to unforeseen magical events, our performance has been... cancelled"?! No! That can't be right! Must be right.

:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': Soooo... a funny thing happened on the way to the theater. The Crystal Globe is reopening as an aquarium. But even if it wasn't, I know that leaving our play was selfish of me. And that is why I believe Sugar Snap should keep the role that I so carelessly cast aside. And now, I shall be out of the play!
:'''Sugar Snap''': Actually, I have a better idea. Let's split the role.
:[applause]
:'''Sugar Snap''': What do you say, Rarity?
:'''Rarity''': I gracefully accept.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Sugar Snap''': So can we finally do that read-through?
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': Absolutely.

==Ponies of the Moment==
:[whooshing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm...
:[ding!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ouch! [whimpering]
:[splatting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! I hope we can get all these orders out in time! I'm a little stressed! But I know we can do it if we all chip in.
:'''Rarity''': Stressed! Yes! Me, too! Virtual baking, darling! Hard, darling!
:[beeping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hellooooo?! It's the middle of our busy season, Rarity! If we get even a few more orders, we're really gonna be in a bind!
:'''Rarity''': Don't you worry. Be right there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Phew.
:'''Rarity''': And by "right there", I mean right after I fill these one hundred new orders and make it to the next level!
:[beeping]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groaning]
:[splatting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [strains]
:'''Gummy''': [chomping]
:'''Rarity''': Whoo-hoo!
::[rhythmically]
::Gotta fake it before you bake it!
::Gotta cup it before you cake it!
::Oh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [growls] Rarity! A little help?! Just a teeny, tiny, little bit of help?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I've got you, Pinkie! Heads up! [straining]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You certainly take the cake, Rainbow Dash. I doubt there's a baking machine in the world you can't keep up with.
:[crank]
:[whirring]
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Applejack''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yells]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps] I regret saying that! Whoooaaaa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yells]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Kind of running out of hoof space for these cakes, Dash!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wuh-oh! I'm tipping!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Pinkie! You got this!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpering]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe she don't got this.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whaaaat am I doing?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, you're... dancing?
:'''Rarity''': Cake-tacular!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Quick! All hooves on deck!
:[splatting]

:[owl hoots]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] I think I'm ready for a nap. [snores]
:'''Rarity''': Brava, darling! Oh, maybe I should've been a little more help.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Hey! Hey, everypony! Check this out! It's an e-mail from the Mayor of the Internet! We've gone viral!
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': Spike, what are you talking about? I only sent the video of Pinkie and the cupcakes to the Mane Six and you. It couldn't have gone viral unless—
:'''Spike''': It was me!
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Spike''': I-I'm sorry, but that was the coolest video I've ever seen! I had to share it with my closest friends on the World Wide Web.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Spike! I don't want to be caught on the web!
:'''Spike''': Not even with... one million views on YouHoof?
:'''Mane Six''': [excited noises]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This ''is'' pretty cool, ponies. But let's all agree not to let the viral fame go to our heads, okay?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Okay.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Viral fame has gone to our heads!''
:'''Fan Pony''': [giggles]
:[zip!]
:[camera clicking]
:'''Applejack''': I don't get it. It's just a wall.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, but it's a famous just-a-wall now!
:[camera clicks]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Sometimes this do be bad"? What does that even mean?
:[camera clicks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Who cares? They're talking about us!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey, guys! This is my cool Frosting-Tron Frosterator! It's the best, and I use it every day!
:[cameras clicking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': #Ad.
:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] I'm out of bandwidth for this. End montage.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Last call for photos! And cakes, too. I guess we still sell those.
:[door closes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh, snoring]
:[door opens]
:[rooster crows]
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': What's going on with the video? Any more action?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nah. No new views.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And no line? But we're only one day into our fifteen minutes of fame!
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] Thank the internet. It's about time.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, yeah, uh, what a relief.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, you said it. What a relief. [laughs nervously]
:'''Mane Six sans Applejack''': [laugh nervously] Hmmm...
:'''Applejack''': [groans]

==One Click Wonder==
:[patriotic music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So, when the crowds get here, remember to shake everypony's hoof on your way in. Photo ops should happen at the photo wall. And above all else, smile! We've got to stay on the Viral Express! Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga, choo-choo!
:[door opens]
:[applause]
:[beep]
:[wind whistles]
:'''Ponies''' and '''Spike''': [sigh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I guess this means we've gone back to normal.
:'''Spike''': The video only had one view today. And it was me.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs]
:'''Rarity''': Yesterday, our inbox was full of fan mail. And today, it's at zero. Oooh! This looks promising. Do any of you know a prince from Neigh-geria?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Rarity''': He wants to give us a lot of bits!
:'''Fluttershy''': You catch the attention of so many ponies all at once. I thought they were our friends. We didn't even get to say goodbye.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The crowds might be gone, but the Frosterator is still here! Great gifts for extended family members and casual acquaintances.
:[boom!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I tried to figure out algorithms to put us back on top, but they're more chaotic than Discord!
:'''Applejack''': At least now we can go outside without all that attention and make some new memories together.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're right, Applejack! We don't need views or Frosterator deals. We just need to go outside and make... a new video go viral!
:'''Rarity''': Yay!
:[boom!]
:[fizzle]
:'''Applejack''': Yeah, not exactly what I said. 
:'''Spike''': It's so simple.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Like syrup! If everypony helps, we'll be trending by lunchtime.
:'''Fluttershy''': But how do we make a video go viral?
:'''Spike''': Well, let's see what's trending.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look at his little legs go!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': See? All we have to do is produce hilarious original content in a bite-sized package for the masses to consume.
:'''Applejack''': What if we just do somethin' for ourselves?
:'''Spike''': Looks like all these videos have the same thing. Comedy plus pets plus magic equals viral.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] As much as I love drama, comedy has always been my true forte.
:[cameras clicking]
:'''Rarity''': [laughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, I would love to do something with my pets.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You can count on us to put the "action" into "reaction"! Right, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, if you say so.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's... get... trending!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Rarity, to your mark, please!
:'''Rarity''': [clears throat] For my first impression, I will conjure the voice of Applejack. [sighs] Ah reckon it is a beautiful day for apple-uh picking-uh.
:'''Applejack''': Yes! Thank you! Let's go!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Pickin'. Pick-in'. The "G" is silent. Come on, Rarity. You've been training for this.
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait, is it recording? [clears throat] Oh. The pets aren't here yet.
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whispering] They all have the lines.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think we need to brainstorm some more ideas.
:[buzz]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, I haven't gone yet, but we need to go outside for it.
:'''Applejack''': Yes! Please listen to these ponies! Let's pick some apples!
:'''Rarity''': That's mah line, dahlin'.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How would apple-picking go viral?
:'''Applejack''': It wouldn't. But we might just have some fun doin' it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe later. Dash, you're up!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat] Warning – do not attempt this at home unless you're a trained professional. Or me.
:[whooshing]
:[pinball sounds]
:[thunder]

:[beep]
:'''Mane Six sans Applejack''' and '''Spike''': [cheer]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That was amazing! But where did Applejack go?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe she's in the footage.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': I think all this viral talk has her wanting to unplug.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, what's this filter?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, I think it's just ''outside''.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe it's time we go experience it for ourselves. Offline.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Just the pony we're looking for!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, sorry, ya'll. You'll have to film yourselves. My viral days are done for.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No video, no tablets. Just us.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Plus apple picking.
:'''Applejack''': Really? For me?
:[creaking]
:[crunch!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [scream]
:'''Applejack''': [yelps, groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [scream]
:[thunder]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That... was... awesome!
:'''Rarity''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now ''that'' would make a great video!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry. It doesn't have to be a video at all. And we're sorry we didn't realize you wanted to hang with just us and not the whole internet. Friends?
:'''Applejack''': Forever!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] I guess some of the best moments are the ones recorded up here.
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rarity''': Group hug!
:'''Mane Six''': [giggling]

==Potion Mystery==
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And for my next trick... [slurps]
:[poof!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Gotta go dash!
:[whir!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! [giggles] How precious. Me next. [slurps]
:[slide whistle]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm. I don't feel anything. Wait! The crick in my neck is gone! Double wait. What are you doing down there? [giggles]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': It made you all shorter.
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Fluttershy''': [laugh]
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Helloooo! Just in time for the last potion.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [slurps]
:[poof!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Fluttershy''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Potions are so zany! Do you know when you're ordering more, Pinkie?
:[pop]
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I don't order them. I thought ''you'' ordered them.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Me?
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Who ordered what? We gettin' pizza?
:[door closes]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait, if ''I'' don't order them and ''you'' don't order them, then where do they come from?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, the fridge, of course!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, but who puts them there?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh. Now that you mention it, I'm not sure. Whoever it is refills it while we're sleeping every night.
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're telling me a stranger sneaks into Sugarcube Corner, restocks our potions, and leaves without a word?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps] Is something wrong?! Did the fridge die?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I ''will'' find the culprit.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wasn't me. I have an "ali-pie". [chomps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's odd. I can't find a single print or hair that would help me determine who was involved.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You could call this a... cold case.
:'''Spike''': YEEEEEAAAAAAH—! [groans] Sorry. Stubbed my toe.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'd wager to say this case is just heating up!
:'''Spike''': YEEEEEAAAAAAH—! [groans] Ow! Stubbed my other toe.
:'''Fluttershy''': Who's to say it's a pony at all? What if it's a magical creature?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The evidence says otherwise. These potions are made by a gifted magic user/scientist. A genius! A pony I absolutely must meet!
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Fluttershy''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They must've been perfecting this recipe their whole life. Every time I try to reformulate one of these potions, I fail miserably.

:[boom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': One failure closer to success! [coughs]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's imperative we find them so I can become their apprentice! If we empty the fridge, they'll restock it tonight. Then we stay up!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And catch 'em in the act!
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! We can build a pillow fort!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now we get comfy and wait.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [snoring]
:[owl hoots]

:[rooster crows]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! We missed them!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': Quiet like a mouse. I respect it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's it! No more pillows! It's too comfy! Too dangerous!
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We have to stay awake at all costs!

:'''Winona''': [snoring]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] I'm sorry, Twilight. Once the sun goes down, so do my eyelids.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe this is one mystery that is meant to remain unsolved.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. This isn't the end of the line. Not by a long shot. Rainbow Dash, hide the rest of the potions. Pinkie, nothing cracks louder than your peanut brittle. We'll lay a trap that will wake even the sleepiest sleeper! Fluttershy, dust the floor in powdered sugar. We'll get hoofprints one way or another! They'll never see us comin'.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [snores]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans, snores]
:'''Fluttershy''': [snores]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:[bells ringing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Gotcha!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm awake! Definitely so awake!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, Twilight? [smacks lips] I think our plan is crumbling. It needs more butter.
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Fluttershy''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [sigh]

==Sick Day==
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [slurping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hold on to your cutie marks! We just got our biggest order yet!
:'''Rarity''', '''Applejack''', and '''Rainbow Dash''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Celestia needs six different flavors, two dozen each! All for her big birthday ba... ahh... [sneezes]
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Excuse me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're sick!
:[zipping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just a little tickle in my muzzle. [sneezes]
:'''Rarity''', '''Applejack''', and '''Rainbow Dash''': Uh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Applejack''': Oh, please. Get her to quarantine!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're no exception. I already sent Twilight and Fluttershy home with acute cough-itis.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Fluttershy''': [shivering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Special... pizza delivery... for my brain...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pardon...? [coughs] Which way to the peppermint cabbage patch...?

:'''Pinkie Pie''': I can't leave the kitchen! Who will make Celestia's cupcakes? Ah... [sneezes]
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, you must rest. We'll take care of things around here.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmm, fine. I'll go, but we can't screw up this order. Follow these closely!
:'''Rarity''': Lovely. Germy instructions.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope.
:'''Applejack''': [screams]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's a glossary of helpful terms that will come in handy when reading the ''actual'' instructions.
:'''Applejack''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hmmm...
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, Pinkie, off you go. The cupcakes are in good hooves. See ya!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps]
:[thud!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rest up.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, poor Sicky Pie. But we'll do just fine without her precious rules.
:'''Applejack''': [coughs]
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Uh... gesundheit?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, not you, too!
:'''Applejack''': [sniffles]
:'''Rarity''': Home, Applejack! Home! Spare the rest of us.
:'''Applejack''': Fine. [sniffles] I'm goin', but I'm not— [coughs] —happy about it.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panicked whimpering] Gotta work! Gotta perfect the recipe for Celestia! Oh, no! What about frosting? [shudders] Marzipan, cotton candy, lavender, jasmine, butter, bean soup, candle wax, and pickles! Makes my tummy rumble!
:[stomach rumbles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oopsies. But I have to share this with Rainbow Dash and Rarity! What do you think, Gummy?! Blink once if you hate it!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Good enough for me!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ahhh...
:[splat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, these look edible-ish. How are we doing on frosting, Rarity?
:'''Rarity''': [vibrating] Noooooot greeeeeeat!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, may be time to crack open Pinkie's playbook.
:[phone rings]
:'''Rarity''': Hello?
:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Rarity''': Celestia! What's that? You're coming early?!
:[blender whirring]
:'''Rarity''': That's completely fine! See you soon!
:[click]
:'''Rarity''': What do we do?! ''What do we do?!'' If only we had written instructions on how to properly run a cupcake business!
:[pounding on door]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groaning] Must... bake... cupcakes...!
:[door creaks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Pickles... are in... the fridge...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pickles? She's delirious.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Reeeeead the instructioooons... and pull the red lever on the auto-froster! Section Pink, subsection D! [singsong] The footnotes!
:'''Rarity''': We promise we'll read the instructions. Just stay in bed to keep the virus from spreading!
:[drilling]
:[blowtorch]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Phew! Bet you barricading the door isn't in that binder.

:'''Pinkie Pie Hologram''': Hello, friends. If you're seeing this, I have a terrible fever and you probably barricaded me in my room by now in order to fill a request without me. Please do the opposite of whatever my delirious mind makes me say, and all will be well. That's a Pinkie Promise! Love you! Bye!
:[winding down]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hmmm.
:'''Rarity''': Well, she did say to push the red lever. So that means...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pull the ''blue'' lever!
:[splat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Celestia''': [gasps]
:[zip!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, perfect. I'm so glad I chose Sugarcube Corner for my party-catering needs.
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': Us, too!

:'''Rarity''' and '''Applejack''': [slurping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Rarity''': Pinkie! You look as healthy as your hologram.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Thank you for taking care of business while I was down. I'm glad I listened to you and rested.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And ''we're'' glad we listened to you and followed your directions. Eventually. We should've trusted you from the get-go.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, it all worked out perfectly.
:[stomach rumbles]
:'''Rarity''': Blegh!
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, no, it's fine. I feel absolute— [vomits]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sounds of disgust]

==Part 1==
:[rattling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie Pie! Aah!
:[splat!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She's just about done it. Oh, yes. Pinkie Pie might have created the perfect dessert!
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:[splat!]
:'''Rarity''': I will always love you, but... ''you've ruined me!''
:'''Applejack''': Easy now, Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': ''My mane!'' [wailing]
:'''Applejack''': [to fourth wall] Did you miss this? I missed this.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It all comes down to this! May I present a Pinkie Pie original recipe... the Ice Cream Sundae of Towering Importance! [giggles]
:[pop, fizzle]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait for it...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Three...
:'''Applejack''': Two...
:[pop!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': One! [screams]
:[rumbling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oops.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aah!
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I, uh... [laughs] ...meant to do that.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Potions! Potions for everybody!
:[gulping]
:'''Applejack''': Pinkie, did you have to make that sundae so... dramatic?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': YES! It's just one of the recipes I'm considering for my Royal Jelly Juggernaut audition later today!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [spits] You're auditioning for the Royal Jelly Juggernaut?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A Royal Jelly who-da-what-now?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's a reality show! [gulping]
:[whoosh]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [narrating] Ponyville's greatest dessert makers face off in a jelly battle royale! Judged by the enigmatic ingenue of irresistible icing herself – Princess Celestia!
:[cameras flashing]

:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh. A telepathy potion. Very chill.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is not chill at all! [slurps]
:[bottle smashes]
:[whoosh]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [narrating] It's the saltiest competition that ever called itself sweet! Even the most precise ponies go home with their heads hung low!
:[splat]
:[flies buzzing]
:[click]
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]

:[whoosh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maintaining a clean workspace is vital!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gulping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No pressure.
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Exactly! No pressure! It's just a series of incredibly competitive auditions followed by a callback, a bake-off, and a personal interview. Should be a breeze! All I need to do is practice, practice, practice and get feedback from my best buds. ''TO THE TEST KITCHEN!''
:[zip!]

:[flies buzzing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not ''not'' worse than I thought.
:'''Rarity''': Huh?
:[tink, tink]
:'''Rarity''': [screams, groans]
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Applejack, and Rarity—
:'''Rarity''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, she's still fainted. From a place of love and support... we have to stop her!
:'''Rarity''': [groans] We must help Pinkie Pie!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Right. Yeah, that's what I meant. From a place of love and support, we have to ''help'' her.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scat-singing] [deep voice] Pastries!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, please tell me you have a plan for your audition.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I do! Step one— Aah!
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Have fun!
:[clang!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's it. That's the only step.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, great. And cool. And nice.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We can fix this. We gotta fix this!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You know how I'd audition? I'd be mindful of health codes.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look, Pinkie. An audition needs something that's gonna grab their hearts, eyeballs, and advertisers!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What if you make it to hometown cook-offs?! We gotta get this place sparkling clean! Even if we have to turn it inside-out and upside-down!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Good idea, Twilight! My pineapple upside-down cake always impresses.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's not what I meant.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know. That's what I love about you. You're brilliant without even trying.
:[zip!]
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [screams]
:'''Rarity''': You know, darling... I once thought about getting into the "biz", meaning the TV industry. I could've been a star, too, I tell you. But I gave it all up to focus on my suntan. How's that turned out? Don't ask. Long story. [kisses]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I love your long stories, Rarity, but I'm running out of time.
:'''Rarity''': The perfect audition requires the perfect audition look. May I?

:[music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [grunting] Ooh!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [awestruck sounds]
:'''Rarity''': Behold her! Pinkie Pie – polished!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': She's camera-ready!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cake-ready, too! Is this upside-down enough for ya, Twilight?
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's just one more recipe I want to try. Mostly because it's so fun to say. ''FLAN!'' It's as flashy as I am now! And not only that, I finally got my hair net to stay on!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [awestruck sounds]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[blender whirring]
:[zip!]
:[boing!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]
:[thud]
:[blender whirring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': [gulps]
:[boom!]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [grunting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously] Oops.

==Part 2==
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [grunting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] Looks like we're in a pretty—
:'''Applejack''': Don't say it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': —''sticky'' situation.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', and '''Rarity''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You guys!
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'll save you!
:[fanfare]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': At least if she's stuck, she won't be able to make it to—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ugh! Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ugh! I know! I wanted you all to come support me at my audition!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just remember to clean as you cook.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And do something flashy!
:'''Rarity''': And put your best face forward!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If you follow those rules, you've got this. No way you'll look like a silly filly. No pressure!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. [laughs nervously] Okay. [voice cracking] No pressure.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, we did all we could.
:'''Fluttershy''': She seemed really sad. This feels... not good.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe we should've just believed in her from the start?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sigh] Yeah...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I... made a mistake, didn't I? And now she's going all alone!
:'''Applejack''': We gotta make a plan to get out of this flan! Uh, as quick as we can! Hand me that pan! Let's eat!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [eating noisily]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [with mouth full] We're coming, Pinkie!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Our hero in pink stands under the bright lights of the Royal Jelly Juggernaut competition kitchen. Game time! Steely, she looks across the studio to see three tail chairs. These are the judges' chairs.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Uh, excuse me, but are you... narrating?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh? Oh. Yeah. Kinda.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well then... [clears throat] One audition, one recipe. That's all that stands between you and TV stardom.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh. I thought it was gonna be a lot more complicated than that. Prepare to have your taste buds totally ANNIHILATED! Then revived stronger than ever by a Pinkie Pie original recipe! Watch as I create upside-down flan cakes! [imitating Rainbow Dash] Be flashy! [imitating Rarity] Look the part! [imitating Twilight Sparkle] And keep it clean! [sighs] I can do this. [gasps]
:[bowl smashes]
:[gong!]
:[pen scribbles]

:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [groaning]
:'''Rarity''': [burps] I can't! I simply cannot eat another bite!
:'''Applejack''': You can't get up and leave this kitchen until you finish your dessert! [sighs] Literally. None of us can.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We have to eat! For Pinkie!
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': [eating noisily]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers] Clean as you cook... Whoops! Aah!
:[thud]
:[clatter]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here's a little flash— Aah! Too much flash!
:[splat]
:[whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay. [pants] I'll put my best face forward and—
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oops.

:[ding!]
:[zip!]
:[slide whistle]
:[sparkling sounds]
:[door opens]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no! We're too late!
:'''Princess Celestia''': [lips smacking] This... is so... raw.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:[shatter!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gulps]
:'''Princess Celestia''': It's raw... beautiful television! And not only that, this is the best cake I've ever taken a teensy little bite of! Oh, you must be on the show!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Really?! But my audition was a disaster.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Eh, maybe so. But your baking's top-notch, and it's you who really takes the cake! [giggles, snorts] Did you get that? That's gold.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo-hoo!
:[pop, fizzle, pop]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! Whoo!
:'''Princess Celestia''': A second helping, please!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, I'm sorry. I was afraid you'd embarrass yourself. When the only one who should be embarrassed is me. I tried to make you do things the way I'd do them when you were doing them perfectly fine all along.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's okay. I know you were just trying to help. But I can't help being me. And I like it that way. [gulping, hiccup] Uh-oh!
:[poof!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Pinkie Pie}}''': Whoa! [gulping, hiccup]
:[poof!]
:'''{{H:title|as Applejack|Pinkie Pie}}''': Actually, it's kinda fun to be you guys, too!
:[poof!]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

:[lamps clicking]
:'''Rarity''': Hello there, my darlings! This is Rarity, and this, my sweet angels, is ''Rare Occasions with Rarity''! Thank you for subscribing! Welcome to my one-hundredth episode!
:[party horn]
:'''Rarity''': Oh. Should I say "sweet darlings" and "angels", or should I keep "sweet angels" and "darlings"? [murmurs] I guess I can decide during the real livestream.
:[zip!]
:'''[Rarity]'''
::[singing] One hundredth ep, show me some respect
::I've got no regrets, bah-bah-bah... bah...
:[muttering] Ah. The rest of the words will come later.

:[oven whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Old friends and new friends alike, I need to know your true opinions. You three, I can't stress enough how valuable your taste buds are. You are healthy eaters who have not truly tried dessert before coming to Ponyville. Ooh! I should be taking notes!
:'''Echo''': [chomps]
:[rock music]
:[whoosh!]
:[flatulence]
:'''Echo''': Noooo!
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Sugar Snap''', and '''Lightning Chill''': [gasp]
:[squeak!]
:[rattle!]
:'''Echo''': Wow!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So? You like it?
:'''Echo''': It's, uh... It's a flavor explosion. And explosions scare me. I-I wasn't ready. [chuckles]
:[powering down]
:'''Rarity''': Sorry to interrupt, darlings, but tonight is the hundredth episode of my livestreaming solo show!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': Tonight, I will be doing my all-me rendition of David Mane-et's classic, ''Glengrassy Glen Crop''. Which of my lovely buddies will assist please?
:'''Applejack''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Rainbow Dash''': Uhhh...
:'''Sugar Snap''': I'll do it!
:'''Rarity''': [yelps] Where did you come from?
:'''Sugar Snap''': The portal. Remember?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [giggle and "awww"]
:'''Rarity''': No, I-I meant—
:'''Sugar Snap''': Oh, relax, I'm just goofin'.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Sugar Snap''': I did that play in our dimension. I know it well.
:'''Rarity''': Um, I was thinking more a buddy I know.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': Rarity! She knows the play, and she's funny as all get-out.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Plus, it would be like a student taking a masterclass from a pony at the top of her game!
:'''Sugar Snap''': What she said.
:'''Rarity''': Well, let's not waste another minute, Sugar Snap. I'd love to see you at the taping.
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Pinkie, you can provide refreshments if you so please. I would love for your cakes to complement my performance.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, and minus a cup, plus a tablespoon... [gasps] I can't believe I'm saying this. But do these need... ''less chocolate?!''
:[rumble!]
:[squirt!]
:[crash!]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [gasp]
:'''Echo''': Perhaps just a little less?

:'''Rarity''': Soooo... you are a comedienne?
:'''Sugar Snap''': Oh, yeah! I had my own network TV show – ''Coleslaw & Order''. I played a short-order cook who was long on laughs. It was based on my comedy routine.
:'''Rarity''': Well, that sounds divine. Uh, I'm going to do a run-through. Would you adjust that light so I look simply radiant?
:'''Sugar Snap''': Will do!
:[zip!]
:[clunking]
:'''Rarity''': Acting! I've been coming to this diner every day, you know? [deeper voice] What'll it be, Marge? [normal voice] Give me... uh... oh.
:'''Sugar Snap''': [affecting voice] Yeah, gimme the usual. Anything I can douse with hot sauce until it's unrecognizable.
:'''Rarity''': Why, yes, thank you, darling. Now where was I? Ah, yes. Give me—
:'''Sugar Snap''': You know, Rarity, I can jump in there and run it with you. Just for rehearsal.
:'''Rarity''': Well, I am usually more of a—
:'''Sugar Snap''': I'm not trying to step on your hooves. I just know I get most of my best work dunzo when I'm doing it with friends. Even new friends.
:'''Rarity''': Well then, from the top!
:'''Sugar Snap''': From the top!
:'''Rarity''' and '''Sugar Snap''': From the top!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay, pals, I experimented all day looking for a great flavor that was less, um...
:'''Echo''': Too too much much?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, okay, okay. I've come up with a less overpowering cake. Presenting an olive oil cupcake with a salted peanut butter frosting!
:'''Lightning Chill''': [chomps] Ooooh! You nailed it!
:'''Echo''': [chomps] Delicious! Delicious!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [chomp, cheer]
:'''Lightning Chill''': It's almost like...
:[powering down]
:[clank!]
:'''Rarity''': Hello, my dear fans and friends. I am Rarity, and thank you for coming to my one-hundredth livestream.
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Rarity''': Tonight, I will be performing some top-notch drama. But I won't be flying solo.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': No! Instead, I would like to invite my good friend and rehearsal partner and the star of ''Coleslaw & Order'', Sugar Snap!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [cheer]
:'''Sugar Snap''': Me?
:[clank!]
:'''Sugar Snap''': I'm so excited to join you!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': Awwww!
:'''Rarity''': I realize I could probably do it without you, but not if I wanted to be the best. And I do. Let's wow them, scene partner!
:'''Rarity''' and '''Sugar Snap''': Acting!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Wild Siders''': [cheer]

==Portal Combat==
:[dance music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:[whooshing]
:[wind rushing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great! Now try the Reverse Trapeze!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! Thanks for helping me practice my moves, Twilight. I am gonna be a breakdancing star!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's do one more. The Dash Master!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I've never done the Dash Master before.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It has "Dash" in it. It's like it was made for you. You got this!
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoaaaa!
:[splat!]
:[squeak!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:[pinball sounds]
:[vortex swirling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans, yells] Whoa. That was a close...
:[vortex swirling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...caaaaall!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': [panting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no! What's going on?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The portal's pulling Rainbow Dash! Quick! Help a pony out!
:'''Applejack''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': It's like she's stuck!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, it seems like I'm getting sucked all the way in and the portal is closing up!
:'''Echo''': Those of us from the Wild Side will be trapped here forever!
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Echo''': [yelp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yelling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Echo''': [gasp]
:'''Echo''': Do any of you know a science pony clever enough to save Rainbow Dash and solve this problem?
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do I have something in my teeth?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]

:[squeaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah! Let's do this!
:[hammering and wrenching]
:[ding!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! [chomps] Mmm! It's done!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The P.D.R. 9000!
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Echo''': Ooooh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [deeper] The portal's changing my voice!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [deeper] How looooow can it gooooo?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpering]
:[electrical sounds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Oh.
:[fizzling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yelling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's okay! It was a first attempt!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We don't have time for a first attempt! Time is of the essence!
:'''Echo''': It's looking like the portal will be closed forever! That'll be sad!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [even deeper] Uh, yeah! That would not be ideal!

:[squeaking]
:[knock on door]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpering]
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We brought something to relieve the stress.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do I seem stressed?!
:[rumble!]
:[shatter!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': When I'm stressed, I bake.
:'''Applejack''': And I stroll through the orchard.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So we combined the two. Apple pie!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chomps] Mmm! Delicious!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But I'm still stressed!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooookay. Our de-stress tactics didn't work, but clearly something is stressing you out. And I think it's more than just getting the machine to work. What is it, Twi? We want to help.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, it's all my fault! If I didn't push Rainbow Dash to do the Dash Master, then this would never have happened! Now the Wild Siders and Rainbow Dash will both be out of luck!
:'''Applejack''': You're not bein' fair. You and Dash were playin' together. Don't let guilt get in the way of craftin' a solution.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chomps, gulps] Ohhhh, I get it! Applejack and Pinkie Pie! Apple pie! You combined the two!
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's it! I know how to fix... well, everything! Let's go!
:[zip!]

:[vortex swirling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [even deeper] Have you come to say "seeeee yaaaaa laaaaateeeeer"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've come to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got you, Echo, and everypony into this mess.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [even deeper] It was neeeeeveeeeer yooooour faaaaault. Weeeee're iiiiin thiiiiis togeeeeetheeeeer.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I know. My equation wasn't working because I was only thinking of the Equestria side of the portal. But we need to think of both sides. We have to combine them! Don't you get it?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Not really.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, what now?
:[clunk!]
:[electrical sounds]
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts, sighs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [squeals]
:'''Echo''': Does this mean "goodbye, portal"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nope!
:[crank]
:[clunk!]
:[vortex swirling]
:[whoosh]
:[pulsing sound]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I fused the portal with the door! Now it's a doorway between our two dimensions!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's like the apple pie! You combined them!
:'''Echo''': You saved the day, Twilight! We can be friends forever!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh, ooh! Dance party to celebrate! Who wants to see me do the Dash Master?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Echo''': Nooooo!

==The Rarity Report==
:'''Herd Happily''': Herd Happily live at the Sportacular Spectacular, providing an exclusive look at athletes off the field. Hello, sporty ponies! You're all about to compete in the games. What's the secret behind playing your best?
:'''Applejack''': Uh... I pick apples.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Um, I've been practicing my game face. [whispering] Can you see it?
:'''Rarity''': Allow me to speak for my camera-shy friends. Each of us has been training sportacularly hard for this spectacular event and can't wait to compete.
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Applejack's been training in her orchard to reach peak physique!
:[clang!]
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Twilight keeps stats to track how she's doing on the field. And Fluttershy has devised a pump-up routine to get into the competitive spirit.
:[loud thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': [roars]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [yell]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm.
:'''Herd Happily''': Wow. And what about you? What event can we look forward to seeing ''you'' perform in?
:'''Rarity''': ''Moi''? Oh, [laughs] While I do enjoy being center stage, athletics is not my forte.
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You can catch her at fencing later!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, the only time you'll catch me with a foil is when I'm dyeing my mane! [laughs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But you're a pro! You said so yourself!
:'''Rarity''': Dearest Dash! That résumé is for stage combat, not hoof-to-hoof athletics! What have you signed me up for?! [faints]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': See? "Champion fainter" right here. Ooh, she can also cry on cue.
:'''Herd Happily''': Me, too. Back to you, Karen.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm sorry, Rarity. All the rest of us have signed up for games, and I didn't want you sitting out.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, it's not your fault, Dash.
:[poof!]
:'''Rarity''': Even as a young filly, sports were never in the cue cards for me. Although I did once attend a "basket ball".

:'''Rarity''': [narrating] I brought my finest basket expecting a splendid affair. But instead of dancing, everypony was just running back and forth throwing a ball into bottomless baskets. Hmph! I couldn't keep up at all.

:'''Rarity''': It was positively dreadful. And ever since then, I swore only to attend basket galas and soirees.
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm sure there's an activity for you. This is the Sportacular Spectacular. There's something for everypony here. Even indoor ponies.
:'''Rarity''': Whoa!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Well, looky here, Rarity. How about rhythmic trampolinin'?
:'''Rarity''': The only "bounce" I want is in my curls.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then how about curling?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, [scoffs] Unless it involves my mane, no, thank you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh! This one's artistic! Cloud gymnastics!
:'''Rarity''': Ah! The humidity, darling! [gasps] This one will do!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Freestyle debate ribbon-pinning?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, perfection! It combines two of my loves – oration and decoration! This calls for a celebration!
:[thud]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': [reading] "Freestyle debate ribbon-pinning has been cancelled due to... lack of interest"?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awww...
:'''Rarity''': [whines] But this was it. My ideal event. It was perfect for me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We can keep looking, Rarity. There's bound to be another event here for you.
:'''Rarity''': Do not fret for me, Equestrians. The truth is, this is not the end of my story. I shall find a place within it, no matter what!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:[ding!]
:'''Rarity''': That's it! I know what I can do at the Sportacular Spectacular! Use my strongest muscle of all!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?

:'''Herd Happily''': How would you describe the Sportacular Spectacular?
:[dubstep music]
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': The DJ doesn't speak. Allow me.
:[microphone feedback]
:'''Rarity''': DJ, what events are you mixing while you are here?
:[dubstep music]
:'''Rarity''': Disco discus! Should be a "groovy" game!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! [laughs] She's a natural.
:[dubstep music]
:'''Herd Happily''': Thank you for saving my interview.
:'''Rarity''': It was my pleasure. Interview-saving is one of my résumé skills. In fact, it seems I am perfectly qualified to join you as co-lead?
:'''Herd Happily''': It's called a co-anchor.
:'''Rarity''': Oh! So I got the part? You "Herd" it here first! A pony never arrives unprepared.
:'''Herd Happily''': Well, there's plenty more where that came from here at the Sportacular Spectacular. I'm Herd Happily.
:'''Rarity''': And I'm Rarity, come to you live! Back to you, Karen.

:'''Karen''': Uh, thanks, Rarity. In entertainment news, Finn Tastic's new summer blockbuster is making a splash. But it's this reporter's opinion that ''Roger the Singing Dolphin 2: Roger Sings Again'' doesn't have nearly enough singing. [laughs]

==The Great Divide==
:'''Fluttershy''': I can't believe how much fun the Sportacular Spectacular is.
:'''Rarity''': Agreed, darling. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not the sportiest of ponies, and even ''I'm'' having a great time.
:'''Applejack''': I'll say. It's always good to get outside, and today is no exception.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's not just ''being'' outside that's been so great. It's being able to do so much stuff together with all of you! My best friends!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Earth to Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm having a friendship flashback!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmmm...
:'''Applejack''': [chomps]
:[loud thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Applejack''': [laugh]

:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You can do it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! Sports!
:[splash!]
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer and laugh]

:'''Announcer''': All ponies to the arena for buckball!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Flashback over! We're on a tight schedule!
:[zip!]
:[splash]

:'''Announcer''': I repeat – all ponies to the arena for buckball!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Let's do this!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're gonna win!
:'''Applejack''': We got 'em!
:'''Fluttershy''': We're gonna ''pulverize 'em into tiny, itty-bitty, little pieces!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. [laughs nervously] I took it too far. [hums] Game time!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:[screech]
:'''Referee''': Hey there, ponies. Line up on the grass and count off to determine teams.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh? Oh, ref. Maybe you don't understand.
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We're the Mane Six. [trumpet fanfare] We're kind of already a team.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah! A team of best friends!
:'''Fluttershy''': Who are gonna pummel the competition!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, save it for the field.
:'''Referee''': Love the enthusiasm. [laughs] Line up on the grass with the other players and count off. We got a game to play!
:'''Snails''': [snoring]
:[honk]
:'''Snails''': Huh? [sighs]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': [chomps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! I thought we'd automatically be on the same team!
:'''Applejack''': Well, me, too! This is not what I had in mind at all!
:'''Rarity''': I don't want to compete against you five. I barely wanted to play in the first place!
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': But I... was excited to be on a team with my besties! [laughs nervously]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I agree with you. This is not how I thought the game would go down.
:'''Referee''': AHEM? I'm clearing my throat for emphasis.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Just a moment!'' Emergency huddle!
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, ponies. They're having us count off, but I've got a plan.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [voiceover] We'll line up next to each other, they'll split the group in two, and we'll face off against the other six.
:'''Fluttershy''': ''We'll clean the grass with them!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... Eh, the grass already looks pretty clean though. You know, they have to keep it cut to regulation.
:'''Rarity''': It was a figure of speech, darling. Even I know that, and I'm out on the grass as little as possible.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, okay! Everypony, we're gonna get out of this huddle and say "break!" to prove that we all understand what's happening. Okay?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now let's get out there, line up next to each other, and get on the same team! Ready?
:'''Mane Six except Fluttershy''': Break!
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Break their spirits!''
:'''Referee''': Okay, ponies! Count off!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Count off? I think you mean split down the middle.
:'''Referee''': No, count off one-two-one-two.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Emergency huddle!
:'''Referee''': No! You've used your allotted huddle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I hate to admit it, but he's right.
:[loud thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's here in the rule book.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] One.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Two!
:'''Fluttershy''': One.
:'''Applejack''': Two.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': One!
:'''Rarity''': Two!
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]

:[crowd cheers]
:[fireworks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whines]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': We have our teams facing off in today's Sportacular Spectacular Mane Event! Pun intended.
:[crowd cheering]
:[whirring]
:'''Dishwater Slog''': We're gonna crush 'em!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! I don't want to hurt them!
:'''Derek''': We're gonna destroy 'em.
:'''Applejack''': But they're our friends!
:'''Snips''' and '''Snails''': We're gonna pulverize 'em into tiny, little, itty-bitty pieces!
:'''Fluttershy''': That's what I said, but... but... [whispers] ...then I changed my mind!
:'''Rarity''': This isn't what friendship is all about. I don't want to do this!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't either!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': It's game time, folks!
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]

==Terrorarium==
:'''Applejack''': [grunting and laughing] I've got it! Got it! [groans]
:'''Winona''': [barks]
:'''Applejack''': It's okay, girl. Found it!
:'''Winona''': [growls inquisitively]
:[poof!]
:'''Applejack''': [groans, gasps] What in carnation?
:[plant squeaking]

:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': And you'll never guess what's inside!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': My lucky spatula? Oh, wait. Here it is.
:'''Applejack''': Good guess, Pinkie. But not as good as the real thing.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': Ta-da!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cute!
:'''Applejack''': I named the little flower Hawthorne the Third. After my favorite singer Yee-hawthorne the Second.
:'''Hawthorne''': [squeaks]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, be careful, Applejack. Magical creature require extra caution.
:'''Applejack''': Well, you ponies worry too much.
:'''Hawthorne''': [squeaks]
:'''Applejack''': Who better to figure this little sprout out than me?
:'''Hawthorne''': [squeaks]
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Applejack''': Oh! Gotta go!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Heya, Big Mac. Have I introduced you to my new little bud?
:[ominous music]
:'''Hawthorne''': [growls]
:'''Applejack''': Isn't he just the cutest little thing you ever did see?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnnope.
:'''Applejack''': There's nothin' to worry about. You're just a unique little bloomer. [yelps] Phew! [chuckles]
:[zip!]

:'''Applejack''': Hmm. You're not garden-variety, but I think you're rootin'-tootin' cute.
:'''Hawthorne''': [growls]
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] Oh, no! I over-watered ya! Here! Have some plant food! It'll fix you right up!
:'''Hawthorne''': Ahhhh.
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] What was in that stuff? Whoa there! I think you've had enough.
:'''Hawthorne''': [whines]
:'''Applejack''': Be right back, Hawthorne.
:'''Hawthorne''': [growls]
:'''Applejack''': Phew.
:[buzzing]
:'''Applejack''': Guess whose green hoof is even greener than ever. This pony!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess this means things are going well with Hawthorne the...
:'''Applejack''': Third! [laughs] You betcha! He's even bigger now.
:[crash!]
:'''Applejack''': [gasps]
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, you're frozen. Maybe you have a bad connection?
:'''Applejack''': I-I'll have to call you back.

:[crunching]
:[ominous music]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, have you seen Hawthorne the Third? He's about yea big now.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnnope.
:'''Applejack''': Huh. Uh...
:[crash!]
:'''Hawthorne''': [roars]
:'''Applejack''': This is all my fault. Everypony was right. I thought it was a flower, but he's just a mean, green mutation from who-knows-where. Well, I do need some help to get this problem under control, but who am I gonna call? Of course! My friends! I figured it out! Thanks for listenin', Big Mac. [sighs]
:[beeping]
:'''Applejack''': Listen. I know I got a lot of explainin' to do, but I could really use a hoof first.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': We're on it!
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did somepony call the gardening squad?
:'''Applejack''': Oh, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you earlier. I thought I could handle takin' care of Hawthorne, but he's outgrown my tender lovin' care.
:'''Rarity''': Does he need a little trim? A little off the top can go a long way. Look at my bangs, darling. Fabulous. I know.
:[crunch!]
:[crash!]
:'''Applejack''': More like he's tearin' up the orchard. And if we don't stop him, he'll do more than just pick it clean.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I need a bigger watering can.
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] Water! He doesn't like water! When I tried to give him some earlier, it made him shrink instead of grow!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then I think it's time for some big, red, delicious water balloons!
:[rock music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Apples! Apples! Get your apples!
:'''Hawthorne''': [roars]
:[whistle!]
:'''Hawthorne''': [roars]
:[splash!]
:'''Mane Six''': [cheer]
:'''Applejack''': Thanks, everypony. I'll say it now – lesson learned. Who would've guessed a balloon would be burstin' with so much trouble? [chuckles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, who? Do we know them? We should talk to them if we do.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack's right. Something's strange about these balloons. And it's about time we got to the root of it.
:[ominous music]
:'''Hawthorne''': [growls]

==Bubble Trouble==
:[sci-fi music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Soooo...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': Huh?
:[zip!]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[pop!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is that a bubble wand?
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, I love bubbles! And wands! This works out perfectly for me!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, maybe we should be careful with this thing. Don't get me wrong, it looks really cool. But we just had to deal with taking down a monster plant together, so maybe let's not go crazy playing with more balloon stuff until we know more about—
:'''Spike''': Wand yoink!
:'''Applejack''': Hey, Spike, be careful.
:'''Spike''': Yeeeeeaaaaaah!
:'''Mane Six''': [yelp]
:'''Spike''': [blowing, giggling]
:'''Mane Six''': [panting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Spike! That came out of a magic balloon!
:'''Spike''': It's no big deal. I used to have one of these when I was a little dragon. Watch this. [blowing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': My hoofness. Those are quite impressive.
:'''Applejack''': Well, would you look at that?
:[warbling]
:'''Applejack''': The bubbles aren't poppin'. They're just... floatin' up and up.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe they pop when they get higher?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nope. As far as I can tell, they're still floating. Hey, Spike! Blow the biggest bubble you can! Really go for it!
:'''Spike''': You're on! [deep breath]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Please be careful!
:'''Spike''': It's just a bubble wand. But okay.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Spike''': [deep breath, blowing]
:'''Mane Six''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Way to go, Spike-o!
:'''Applejack''': Hoo-wee! This one's a real humdinger!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey, uh, that bubble's getting a little close to us, don't you think?
:'''Spike''': So what? Pop it if you want. It's already big enough.
:[boing!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh-oh. I gotta pop this thing! [grunting] A little help, friends?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [yelling]
:[boing!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Okay. This is kinda what I was worried about!
:'''Applejack''': Now, let's not get our britches in a twist. Spike, a little help?
:'''Spike''': Just, uh, let me find something sharp to pop the bubble with.
:'''Rarity''': Don't worry. I'm sure he's got it under control.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey, why does he look so small?
:'''Applejack''': Because he ''is'' small.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] Oh. I thought he was shrinking.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''He's'' not shrinking! ''We're'' getting farther away from him! Spike! Go get help!
:'''Spike''': Get held? I guess I could use a hug. It's been a while.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, ''help!''
:'''Spike''': Oh! Help! I'll be right back!

:'''Rarity''': Perspective, darlings. Look, you can see all of Ponyville. Getting very small. [gags] It would be a shame to barf on it from this height. [gulps] Down, please!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We're in major bubble trouble! We gotta get out of here! Ooh! I know! Let's use magic! Can't believe I didn't think of this earlier.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo!
:[pop!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rarity''': [grunting]
:[boing!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [grunting]
:'''Mane Six''': [yelp, groan]
:'''Applejack''': I think the bubble's magic is stronger than yours.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [yelling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The bubble is even stronger now! [pants] Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!
:[helicopter rotors whirring]
:'''Fluttershy''': Is that a rescue helicopter I hear?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo-hoo! We're saved!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, hi, Tank! Wait. Tank?
:'''Spike''': Can you see me? Can you hear me?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': But I figured I can communicate with you better this way. How you doin'?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're kinda freaking out here, Spike! We can't use our powers!
:'''Spike''': Sometimes I find it hard to concentrate when I'm stressed out, too. Maybe if you just calm down, the bubble will drift back down to the ground? Hang on. Watch this.
:'''Serene Voice''': Relax. Let go of tension and stress. Look at this chick.
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]
:[whistle!]
:[pop!]
:'''Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Spike''': I'm really sorry I caused you ponies so much stress.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-huh?
:'''Spike''': But now that we know it works, anyone else wanna try this thing? It's so cool!
:'''Rarity''': I hate to burst your bubble, dear, but no. I have a much better idea.

:'''Mane Six''': [sighing]

==Time After Time Capsule==
:[calculator clicking]
:[calculator yawns, snores]
:[click!]
:'''Mane Six sans Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Galaxy glow-in-the-dark glaze! Get 'em while they're glowing!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [excited sounds]
:'''Rarity''': Wow, Pinkie! These dough-cup-pops look out of this world!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': They are! I used more of my special Cotton Candy Comet crystals!
:'''Applejack''': Ooh! [chomps]
:[clanging]
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] It's like a fizz-poppin' party in my mouth!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I gotta try that! [chomps]
:[whoosh!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chomps]
:'''Rarity''': [chomps]
:'''Fluttershy''': [chomps]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs]
:'''Applejack''': Somethin' wrong, Fluttershy?
:'''Fluttershy''': Quite the opposite. Things are so amazing right now. But I just wish I could freeze this time forever.
:'''Rarity''': Well, you can! Selfie time!
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]
:[camera clicks]
:'''Rarity''': And print!
:[camera whirs]
:'''Fluttershy''': It's perfect!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I love it! What else can we do so we don't forget how much fun we're having?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We should make a time capsule!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! Then each of us can choose one super-duper-perfect thing to put in it, then we'll bury it, and dig it back up way, way later?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [excited sounds]
:'''Applejack''': So it's settled then. Everypony meet at Ponyville Park tomorrow with your extra-special, one-of-a-kind item.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [giggle]
:[zip!]

:'''Applejack''': Now this is perfect!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um... Hah! Easy-peasy!
:[zip!]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Add nostalgia, multiply by sentimentality, plus usefulness... [gasps]

:'''Rarity''': [gasps] It's perfection. [kisses] Even better!
:'''Opalescence''': [meows]

:'''Gummy''': [slurping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
:'''Gummy''': [slurping]
:[ding!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's a great idea, Gummy! I know exactly what to put in the time capsule!

:'''Fluttershy''': Okay, so which of these things represents me? Oh, I do love my Finn Tastic pillow. But this squeaky carrot from Angel Bunny is also quite special.
:[squeak, squeak!]
:'''Angel''': [growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': I did make lots of fun memories at the Potion Ocean. Maybe my sunglasses? It's so hard to pick just one thing to remind "Future Fluttershy" of all the fun "Now Fluttershy" is having with her best friends! [whimpers]

:'''Applejack''': I brought my third favorite cowpony hat. It's just like the one I was wearin' when I first met all y'all.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': What'd you ponies bring?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I brought us the time capsule!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A first place ribbon from the Sportacular Spectacular, when we all competed as a team!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My favorite calculator, because all of us added together equals friendship!
:'''Rarity''': Drumroll, darlings! The script from my episode of ''Hoof Session''! My monologue as Greedenia P. Dollarsign is seared right into my memory! So you needn't worry! I can recite it for you all at any time! Any time at all! Like now.
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Rainbow Dash''': [whistling]
:'''Rarity''': Hm.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I also brought my best mixing bowl.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooh.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's the one I used in the ''Royal Jelly Juggernaut: All-Star Chefs'' spin-off.
:'''Applejack''': That just leaves you, Fluttershy. What'd you bring?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Fluttershy?

:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, are you all right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why'd you leave our time capsule ceremony?
:'''Fluttershy''': I left because I... I... I couldn't decide! [higher-pitched] Nothing I choose seems special enough to represent our friendship. Just look at this photo. We're all laughing, eating dough-cup-pops, and having a great time. What one single item can show all that?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, are you ponies seeing what I'm seeing?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [sounds of agreement]
:'''Fluttershy''': [higher-pitched] Hmm? [gasps] Of course! It's been right under my muzzle this whole time!

:'''Fluttershy''': It's awesome! Just like my friends!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww.
:[thunk]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:[shimmering]
:'''Applejack''': Hey, Pinkie? That treasure box really was just the thing. Where'd you get it?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, just from one of the mysterious magical balloons. Why?
:[vortex swirling]
:'''Mane Six sans Fluttershy''': [yelp]
:'''Fluttershy''': [yelp]
:'''Mane Six''': [screaming]

==The Great Cowgirl Hat Robbery==
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': [screaming]
:'''Rarity''':
::[operatically] Aaaaaall this swirling in the vortex
:I wonder where we're going.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': [screaming]

:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': [grunt]
:'''Applejack''': More like "I wonder ''when'' we're going." Hey... This is Sugar Street! I reckon that vortex sent us back in time to Old Equestria!
:'''Rarity''': Time travel? My goodness, how can you tell?
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] I recognized it from old pioneer pony tales Granny Smith would tell me. Oh, this is excitin'! I've always dreamt of bein' a real cowpony!
:'''Cowgirl Pony''': You two lose your hats or somethin'?
:'''Rarity''': Why, she's right. I'm not sporting a chapeau, and neither are you.
:'''Applejack''': That's it! Remember how I put my cowpony hat into the time capsule?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Are you, uh, pickin' what I'm growin'?
:'''Rarity''': Yes! We're going shopping for hats!
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] What I mean is,r I think we gotta find my cowpony hat to get back home. But don't worry. [chuckles] These country folk are just my kind of ponies. Here. Follow my lead.

:[lasso whipping]
:'''Applejack''': 'Scuse me. Do you know where we can find a hat?
:'''Cowgirl Pony''': Reckon there are hats every which way is where.
:[wheel squeaking]
:'''Applejack''': Right... But this hat's special.
:'''Cowgirl Pony''': You sayin' my hat ain't special?
:'''Applejack''': Uh...
:'''Rarity''': [country accent] Howdy, stranger. My time-trottin' partner and I are hot on the trail of her missing cowgirl hat. Without it, she's as lost as an alligator in an ice storm.
:'''Cowgirl Pony''': Well, why didn't ya say so? You'll need to see ol' Saddle Bags. He's been ramblin' about a cowgirl hat that fell out of the sky that's a-glowin' like it swallowed the sun. That's Saddle Bags. Always spinnin' yarn.
:'''Applejack''': [scoffs] I don't get it. Why'd she answer you and not me?

:'''Applejack''': [gasps] My hat!
:[screech!]
:'''Saddle Bags''': What in tarnation is all the commotion?!
:'''Applejack''': Heh. You must be Saddle Bags. Howdy to you. That happens to be my hat, and I really need it back.
:'''Saddle Bags''': ''Your'' hat? This here's ''my'' hat! I'm holdin' it, aren't I? [chuckles]
:[beat]
:'''Saddle Bags''': [chuckles]
:'''Rarity''': This isn't working, Applejack. Let me try my something.
:'''Applejack''': I got this. These ponies are my kin. I appreciate what you're sayin', but, uh, the hat really does belong to me.
:'''Saddle Bags''': Ah, razzle and dazzle!
:'''Applejack''': I... I don't know what that means.
:'''Saddle Bags''': The hat chooses the pony. Like an alligator chooses a warm climate. Old Saddle Bags here will only part with it to the cowpony who proves themselves worthy in front of the entire town.
:'''Applejack''': Hmmm... Time for this cowpony to giddy up.

:[lasso whipping]
:'''Cowboy Pony''': Hey!
:'''Applejack''': Betcha never seen a thing like this before. This here's real cowpony stuff. [gasps]
:'''Saddle Bags''': That's nothin'! I juggle apples in my sleep! Literally.
:[cowponies cheer]
:'''Saddle Bags''': [chomps] I have issues. Hat stays with me!

:[sad music]
:'''Applejack''': Turns out I'm not a real cowpony after all.
:'''Rarity''': You ''are'' a real cowpony. You're ''our'' real cowpony.
:'''Applejack''': And ''you're'' a real actress. [gasps] That's it! These Wild West ponies want a show? That's just what we'll give 'em!

:'''Applejack''': Saddle Bags?
:[cowponies gasp, scream]
:'''Applejack''': That hat belongs to me - Applejack, the outlaw of Old Equestria. I mean, ''Now'' Equestria.
:[lasso whipping]
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Rarity''': [country accent] Un-hoof these innocents, outlaw!
:[cowponies cheer]
:[clocktower bell rings]
:[hawk cries]
:'''Rarity''': There's no place for scoundrels like you in a time like this. You're a thing of the past! We are the future!
:[cowponies cheer]
:'''Applejack''': [yelps, laughs]
:[cowponies cheer]
:'''Applejack''': I know when I'm defeated, sheriff. I've learned my lesson. I will try to lead a true and noble life. A life you yourself would be proud of.
:[cowponies awww]
:'''Applejack''': That hat doesn't belong to me. It belongs to a pony who's worthy.
:'''Saddle Bags''': Well, I'll be an alligator in a swamp! You cowponies ''are'' worthy! That was some high-class show-tainment! I got razzled, and you surely did dazzle! [chuckles]
:'''Applejack''': Now I get it!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': Yeeee-haw!
:[vortex swirling]
:[cowponies gasp]
:'''Saddle Bags''': Now do you believe me, Mrs. Bags?!
:[beat]
:'''Saddle Bags''': Aw, pickles and stew!

==The Trail Less Trotten==
:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whistling]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] It's heeeere! [squeals] Our official Trail Trotters troop designation!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fluttershy's gonna be so stoked that we're all finally a troop! Officially recognized by the Ponies Earning Badges Organization, L.L.C.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Careful. Precious cargo.
:'''Rarity''': Flutter dear will be absolutely delighted. She's been certainly mentioning this for decades. An eternity! A long time!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh! I can't believe it! Today's the day I finally take over Sugarcube Corner from Mr. and Mrs. Cake!
:[drums and cymbals]
:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''I'' can't believe there's only two hundred and ninety-five days until Trail Trotters registration opens! And then I simply earn more badges than any other troop in our region, thereby winning the grand prize of an all-expenses-paid trip to meet celebrity dolphin Finn Tastic! I'll just be a pony standing in front of a dolphin, telling him he's my hero!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, what does that have to do with—?
:'''Fluttershy''': My. Hero. HERO!
:[zip!]

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Darlings! Did you all get Fluttershy's text?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I came as fast as I could.
:'''Applejack''': It must be some kind of emergency.
:'''Fluttershy''': Thank you for coming. Only two hundred and ninety-four days until we're the best Trail Trotters troop in the world and we get to meet Finn Tastic and become best friends and probably go on vacation together and have inside jokes! [giggles]
:'''Applejack''': Yeah, I... can't tell if she's excited.
:'''Fluttershy''': ''I'm so excited! Wheeee!''

:[thunder]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': With the Elements of Harmony working in unison, there's no problem too great! No foe too irredeemable! ''No evil that can't be outdone!''
:'''Fluttershy''': And only one day until we get our Trail Trotters troop assignment!
:[roaring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah, yeah. And also, no time until we have to conquer evil.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. Right, right, right. ''TRAIL TROTTERS!''

:'''Applejack''': Uh, openin' somepony else's mail is a felony.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-huh.
:'''Applejack''': But Fluttershy won't mind. All right, everypony. Our request to become an official troop is... denied!
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Rarity''': [cheer, gasp]
:'''Applejack''': Wait. Denied?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Apparently, there's an age cutoff. You have to be a filly to join.
:'''Rarity''': We're too old? Why, one is never too old to have fun. [sips]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Technically, according to Trail Trotters bylaw six-A-dash-three-five-seven, we are.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh-oh. How are we gonna tell—?
:[rumble]
:[boom!]
:'''Fluttershy''': It's TRAIL TROTTERS DAY!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, Fluttershy? [hyperventilates, chomps] We got ourselves a Trotters Troop!
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, we— [grunts] Huh? Oh! Uh, yeah! [laughs] Toot-toot! All aboard for badge city! Here we come! Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga!
:'''Fluttershy''': Badges for crafting! Badges for rafting! Badges for... -ing! Something that rhymes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are you doing?! Cough up that letter and tell her the truth—! [grunts]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ohhhh, I get it. We're covering to protect her beautiful, fragile, and very important feelings. Let's get this Trail Trotter her first, completely real badge!
:'''Fluttershy''': All that's standing between me and Finn Tastic's briny breath is a few badges. So, which one are we earning first?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The...
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...Great Question Badge! The Great Mane Badge!
:'''Rarity''': [forced] What... an honor.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] Someone just earned the Quick Reflexes Badge! The, uh... Apple Badge!
:'''Applejack''': Original.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting]
:'''Fluttershy''': This means everything to me!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And one for yours truly! [grunts]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, Pinkie? Earning badges as a troop is super fun, but shouldn't we tell her it's not real?
:'''Fluttershy''': [hums, giggles] Who's the best badge in the world? It's you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... a little longer can't hurt.
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh, Pinkie! What's that badge for? I haven't seen it in the official Trail Trotters training manual.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, this? It's, um... It's a Badge-Making Badge! Yeah! They just recently added it.
:[suspenseful music]
:'''Fluttershy''': Cool!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Phew!
:[gurgling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [gasp]
:'''Gummy''': [gags]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [scream]

==Death of a Sales-Pony==
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': It's cookie time!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! Finally, after years of begging, you've converted to P.S.T. Pinkie Standard Time!
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, it's cookie ''selling'' time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': Only the top-selling troops qualify to win a meet-and... [imitating dolphin chirp] gree-ee-ee-ee-ee-eet! ...with celebrity dolphin Finn Tastic.
:[dolphin chirp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously] Right. That is what these cookies are for. Selling. And... not eating. [gulps]
:'''Applejack''': Howdy, y'all.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's cookie selling time!

:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We got this!
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Teamwork in action! Noice!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] This is so fun!
:'''Applejack''': And it's always gonna be that way!
:[crunch]
:[bits jingling]
:'''Fluttershy''': Always... be... selling!
:[cha-ching!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:'''Fluttershy''': Divide and conquer!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Fluttershy''': We've got a water-dwelling bottlenosed celeb to meet! Specifically, the star of "Roger the Singing Dolphin" – he played Roger – and "Hamlet" – he played Hamlet.

:'''Applejack''': Thanks! Tell your friends!
:'''Fluttershy''': Pick up the pace, Applejack! Supply and demand! ''Get rid of your supply so ponies demand more!''
:'''Applejack''': Oooookaaaaay.
:[clicking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just created an algorithm targeting anypony who has so much as ''thought'' about cookies today. They're practically selling themselves!
:'''Fluttershy''': Great! Then you're freed up to ''sell even more!''
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gulps]

:[cameras clicking]
:'''Rarity''': Cookies are the latest trend, darling.
:'''Derek''': Food is fashion? Insane. Love it.
:'''Rarity''': They're fierce! Fun! Flashy! And—!
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': [chomps, spits] ''Oatmeal raisin?! Ugh! This'll never do!''

:[zooming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, Fluttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': You really think there's time to chat?! ''Go break your delivery personal best!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] Phew!
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie, we got to ramp up production. These cookies are selling faster than—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': —than I can make them!
:[boom!]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Well, you got to figure it out! These ponies need their cookies!''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''And I need my visit with the world's greatest water mammal...''
:[boom!]
:'''Fluttershy''': ...Finn Tastic!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams] What am I gonna do?!
:'''Spike''': Hey, Pinkie! What kind of snacks you got in here?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh... you're gonna have to earn your snacks today!
:[zip!]

:'''Fluttershy''': ''I've done it! Instant delivery...''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''...great prices...''
:'''Applejack''': [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''...customized orders...''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpering]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''...and fashion spin-off brand!''
:'''Rarity''': No, no, no!
:[crash!]
:'''Rarity''': [groans]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Finn Tastic... I'll see you soon!''
:'''Applejack''': [groans] Fluttershy? We need a word.
:'''Fluttershy''': ''What is it? Time is cookies, and cookies is everything!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's just it! Cookies aren't everything!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': W-Well... they are delicious and sweet.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What we're trying to say is selling cookies just isn't fun like this.
:'''Rarity''': And I'm a complete mess about it!
:'''Applejack''': The troop's supposed to be an enjoyable way for us to all hang out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah, not a tunnel-vision goal to meet this "Phantasmic".
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans] ''IT'S FINN TASTIC!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Aah!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groan]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Oh. I see what happened.'' I made the cherry on top the bottom line, and that's no way to run a dessert business. Or a friendship.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Awwww.
:'''Rarity''': I'm still miffed. But that is cute.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm sorry. When you're at the helm of a cookie empire, everything seems like crumbs in comparison.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I love crumbs!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [narrating] One time, I followed a trail of them into...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': You know what? It's a long story, and Fluttershy's having an epiphany, but I miss my brother.
:'''Fluttershy''': How about this? From now on, cookies are for fun and fun only.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww!

:'''Spike''': Get those pans in the oven, Gummy! Are the snickerdoodles ready for delivery yet?!
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Spike, you three go ahead and... Oh, um... keep making cookies. Just keep at it. You're doing great.
:[cha-ching!]

==What Goes Updo==
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't believe the Crystal Empire Carnival's back in town! The moment that ribbon's cut, I am racing!
:'''Applejack''': I'm ridin' the rip-roarin' rides!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And I'm galloping to the games! With my trusty calculations for best buckball-throwing velocity to hula-hoop-catching probability, those carnival prizes are mine!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whines] I just hope Rarity shows up soon. They're about to cut the ribbon.
:[crowd cheers]
:[cameras clicking]
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Princess Cadance''': The Crystal Empire Carnival is now officially open!
:[snip!]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Princess Cadance''': And to all your happy hooves, welcome!
:[rapid footfalls]
:[zoom!]
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [coughing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Princess Cadance is trotting towards us! Act cool.
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [shuddering]
:'''Princess Cadance''': What's wrong, ponies? Is something off with the opening day ceremonies?
:'''Applejack''': Not at all, Princess Cadance. We're just waitin' for our friend— Dangity-doo! That's one gem of an updo!
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': Oooooh...
:'''Fluttershy''': I wish I could wear my mane like that.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Well, you're in luck. There's a bejewel booth just up the way.
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Mane makeovers for all!
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [gasp]
:[zip!]

:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [cheer]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Yaaas!
:[camera clicking]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Beautiful! Chic! Fierce! You ponies put the "you" in "fab-you-lous"! We have to get a sparkly selfie. Say "faboo"!
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [laughing and cheering]
:'''Rarity''': Yoo-hoo!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] That must be Rarity!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': I am sorry I'm late, darlings. Rehearsal ran long, and you know how that... [gasps] My hoofness! Look at all of your updos!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] You dig? I think this apple really brings out my eyes.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Rarity''': I simply must have mine done in that style, too! ''Immediately!''
:[dramatic sting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, no. The booth's boarded up.
:'''Rarity''': Now I'm stuck with a normal and boring – albeit amazing – mane. This moment can't get any worse!
:[beeping]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! New notification from Princess Cadance!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': Don't mind if I do! [gasps] The sparkly selfie of your updos? [faints]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, Rarity feels so bad.
:'''Fluttershy''': I knew we should've waited.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are we gonna do?
:'''Applejack''': I've got it!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs]
:'''Applejack''': Hey, Rarity!
:'''Rarity''': [yelps]
:[squeak!]
:'''Applejack''': How 'bout we become your personal sparkle stylists?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer]
:[hay rustling]
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] Hmmm.
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ahhh...
:[spraying]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ahhh...

:'''Rarity''': Ooh, I am going to be the most fabulous pony here! Thank you—! [gasps, shrieks, barfs] You've made a mess of my mane!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] I don't think it's all ''that'' bad.
:[flump!]
:'''Rarity''': [growls] What have you done to me?!
:'''Applejack''': I've got it!
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Again.
:[zip!]
:'''Applejack''': Pssst. All right. Solution's as easy as a toad tryin' to wrassle a flea. We just have to muss up our own manes to match Rarity's.

:[zip!]
:[whirring]
:[ponies yelp]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoo-hoo! Whooooaaaa! [laughs, yells]

:[ponies screaming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ugh.

:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:[squeak!]
:[ding!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wheeee!
:[whistle!]
:[squeak!]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [laugh]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': Hmm? [gasps, shrieks, barfs] Darlings, your manes! They're...
:'''Fluttershy''': Delightfully disheveled?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sweetly sloppy?
:'''Applejack''': Rootin' tootin' rumpled?
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [laugh]
:'''Rarity''': But they were so beautiful before. Oh, you didn't have to do that just for me. Sure, I wanted to be included, but I should've accepted that I was late to partake in the fancy fun. On the bright side, at least you still have that sparkle selfie.
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [laugh]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Yaaas!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Princess Cadance is trotting over here. Act cool!
:[zip!]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Actually, I took the sparkle selfie down. After seeing Rarity left out, I realized it has lost its luster. Let's take another one.
:'''Mane Six sans Rarity''': [cheer, gasp]
:'''Rarity''': But your updo was the cutting-edge of coiffure!
:'''Princess Cadance''': And it still is. I love the untidy trend. So chic and low-maintenance.
:'''Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Say "messy do"!
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:[camera clicks]

==Communication Shakedown==
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screaming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Fluttershy''': [screaming]
:haunted house growls]
:'''Rarity''': [giggles]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [panting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': All right, ponies! We're doing this carnival right! But there's still sights to be seen and treats to be eats! So what do we all want to do next?
:'''Applejack''': I – and this might shock some of y'all – feel like bobbin' for apples.
:'''Rarity''': I would like my muzzle painted. Even though there's clearly no improving this visage.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I gotta play the mallet game. I need total strangers to know how strong I am.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'd like to ride the teacups!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Ooh.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': I don't have a reason. Just seems fun.
:'''Mane Six''': [sigh]
:'''Rarity''': Seems we have not arrived at a consensus.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] That's no problem at all. Let's just split up, do separate stuff, then synchronize our plans in a group text.
:'''Applejack''': Hmm. Not a bad idea.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm in.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, I'm adding us all in a text together. And go!
:[beeping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And... break!
:[zip!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Never mind!
:[zip!]

:'''Applejack''': Now, if I know apples like I think I do, just gotta factor in the weight of the submerged Fujis with the bulk of the honeycrisps, minus the displacement of the red delicious... There it is! [chuckles] The biggest apple in the bushel! [grunts] Yee-haw! [chomps]
:'''Pony Running the Booth''': That was the best bobbin' these baby-blues have ever seen!
:'''Applejack''': Well, shucks. Thank you kindly. So what's my prize?
:'''Pony Running the Booth''': Well... it's the apple.
:'''Applejack''': Huh. Fair enough. [chomps]

:'''Face Painter''': Almost finished. No peeking.
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm... Darling, I think you're doing a top-notch job. Just a few suggestions on the intricacies of capturing the butterfly's delicate wings. I could, um... Well, I'll just finish it myself.
:[heavenly music]

:'''Fluttershy''': Whoo-hooooo! This is so exhilarating! I've never known excitement like this! I am on a nonstop thrill ride, and I never want to get off!
:[teacups creaking]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': You ponies dare me to win?!
:'''Pony''': [indifferent grunt]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, well. I dare myself! [grunts]
:[squeak!]
:[ding!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs, kisses]
:'''Reuse Pony''': [gasps] Would you look at that?!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Reuse Pony''': I bet the prize for a win that big is enormous!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh. I'll just have my memory of this moment as my prize.
:[squeak!]
:[crashing sounds]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! That was awesomazing! Better check in with everypony so we can meet up and have even more fun together! "Hey, anyone around or what?" And send! Perfect!

:[phones beeping and buzzing]
:'''Rarity''': "Anyone around or what?" I didn't think we were gone ''that'' long. Is she implying that I've been dillying? Or worse – dallying?!

:'''Applejack''': If she wanted us to meet up sooner, she should've said somethin'.

:'''Fluttershy''': W-What did ''I'' do?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow. No smiley face? Is she mad at me?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Anyone around or what?" [scoffs] Of course I'm around. I'm gonna answer, "Yeah!"
:[beep]

:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Huh?

:'''Rarity''': This cannot be good!

:'''Fluttershy''': "You OK?"

:[phone beeps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "You OK?" Wow. Okay, Fluttershy. Message received! Time to reply in all caps! "I THINK SO!"

:'''Pinkie Pie''': "Whatever."

:'''Mane Six''': [whimper and sigh]

:[Ferris wheel creaking]
:[sad music]
:[hissing]

:[phones ring]
:'''Mane Six''': Oh, hey, it's you! Huh. Hey, stop saying what I'm saying! Stop saying what ''I'm'' saying! I wasn't really mad. It's just 'cause of that really weird text.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''Enough!'' I mean, we had to put an end to this sometime.
:'''Applejack''': Hey, Pinkie? You mean you weren't really mad at us?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, not at all! This has been a great day! Maybe we just needed to communicate a little bit better.
:'''Rarity''': Well, I can say that I'd love to do a little less texting and a little more talking face-to-face. Especially with fabulous friends like you.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awwww!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Look! More treats to be eats! Who wants some? It's on meeee!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [cheer and laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps] Mmmm!

==Whoof-dunnit==
:[clattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoo! I'm on a "roll"!
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] You certainly are, darling. But perhaps you could put a "pin" in it for now?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm almost done. Whoa!
:[crash]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You were right, Rarity. The Pin Pyramid was pretty precarious.
:'''Rarity''': While I am an organizing expert, remember the Marie Pondeau craze?

:'''Rarity''': Joy! Joy! Joy! Everything I own is gorgeous! [sighs]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! Can you teach me?
:'''Rarity''': No.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Awww.
:'''Rarity''': But I do have a fabric organizer that would be perfect for your baking tools. I'll just pop home and get it. [yells]
:[clatter]

:'''Rarity''': Where exactly did I put that thing? [gasps] An orphaned accessory. Where's your mommy, darling?
:[dubstep music]
:'''Rarity''': Hello? Is this yours? Shade in the front, party in the back?
:[dubstep music]
:'''Rarity''': Oh. You're just living your life. Carry on!
:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [to herself] She began to think that the head to which the visor belonged was going to be a hard head to find. Detective Rarity is on the case. Never fear, visor. You'll be shading some pony's eyes in no time. Excellent stitching. Yes, yes, a quality item. A-ha! A clue! Everything seemed to be pointing her in a certain direction. But was it a trick? She'd been bamboozled before. [gasps]
:[snapping]
:'''Fluttershy''': Rarity! Would you like to join me for a moonlit stroll?

:'''Rarity''': [to herself] But she didn't have the time. She had to keep going before the trail went cold.

:'''Rarity''': Say, Fluttershy? What do you know about this visor?
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmmm... Nothing.
:'''Rarity''': Then what is this? [reading] "Don't forget to bring the visors to the moonlight stroll. Kisses, Fluttershy."
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] Auto-correct. That was supposed to say "visitors". Angel Bunny's bunny buddies are visiting from out of town.
:[chittering]
:'''Rarity''': A likely story. Sounds like a fluff piece.
:'''Fluttershy''': It's true. Ask Twilight.

:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [to herself] The dame and her pet seemed to be hiding something. But Detective Rarity would not give up.

:'''Rarity''': So, Miss Sparkle. You are Fluttershy's alibi? But what proof do you have?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My calendar says "moonlight stroll"?
:'''Rarity''': Ah. So it does. But how do you explain ''this''?! "Moonlit stroll – 11pm"! A-ha! Gotcha! Nopony wants the moon in their eyes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All right, all right! I have to come clean! I haven't worn a visor since I was a little filly. I just can't pull them off with these bangs.
:[horror screams]
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm. Oh, darling, it's true. I'm so sorry.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack looks great in every hat. Maybe she knows something.

:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [to herself] While the dame spun her tale, it occurred to this detective that Applejack looks great in every hat. Perhaps she would know something. It was time to get sneaky.

:'''Rarity''': [to herself] Sure it was a seedy part of town. But was Applejack really the bad apple she was looking for? There was really only one way to get to the core of it.
:'''Applejack''': Hiya, Rarity! Uh, why are you bein' sneaky?
:'''Rarity''': I'll turn over that question to ''you'', Miss Jack. Is this or is this not your visor?
:'''Applejack''': Nope. And I cannot lie!
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': [faints]

:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [to herself] Another dead end. But there was still one avenue she had yet to trot down.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity! Are you here to work out with me?
:'''Rarity''': The only working out I'll be doing is to the details of this case. Where have you been for the last hour and a half?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I've been here. At the gym.
:'''Rarity''': The whole time? [scoffs] A likely story.

:'''Rarity''': [panting]

:'''Rarity''': We're only a third of the way through this routine, and it's been an hour and a half! Okay. Your story checks out. 

:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [to herself] Her story checked out. The detective decided to put a pin in the case.
:[ding!]
:'''Rarity''': A pin! The organizer! For Pinkie!
:[zip!]

:'''Rarity''': Oh, look at all my gorgeous hats. I wonder where my visor went.
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Ohhhhh. You've done it again! Solved the mystery! Hats off to you, Detective Me! Oh, my. Where did that come from?

:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [to herself] That's a mystery for another day.

==Dear Tabby==
:[cupcakes exploding]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh? [yells] These firework cupcakes are supposed to explode with flavor! Not ''actually'' explode!
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! Applejack! Perfect timing! Give me a hoof before these cupcakes go cake-pop!
:[thud]
:[clanging]
:'''Applejack''': Yeah, you look like you need a break.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Applejack''': Why don't we sit a spell and take a gander at my favorite blog, "Dear Tabby"? 
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh. What's Dear Tabby?
:'''Applejack''': You don't know Dear Tabby?!

:'''Applejack''': [voiceover] Dear Tabby gives the best advice. And what's more, nopony knows her real identity.

:'''Applejack''': Her advice always hits home.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sounds awesome! Hey... she could be me!
:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] She could be Spike.
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Applejack''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, it couldn't. She could be Rarity!
:'''Rarity''': Darling, nopony else could be Rarity. Who else could pull off the one-pony show ''Mane of Thrones''? [deep voice] When you play the Mane of Thrones, you win or you dye... your mane!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh...
:'''Rarity''': I've been rehearsing all day. I need a snack.
:'''Applejack''': Have a fresh apple. It'll pick ya right up.
:'''Rarity''': What a delightful offer. But I'd much prefer a ''real'' sweet treat from Sugarcube Corner.
:'''Applejack''': Well, apples ''are'' the original sweet treat.
:'''Rarity''': Hm. [amplified] Apples are fine, but cupcakes are divine.
:'''Applejack''': [amplified] Cupcakes are acceptable, but apples are delectable.
:'''Rarity''': Cupcakes I'm adoring, but apples give me snoring.
:'''Applejack''': Well, apples are perfect!
:'''Rarity''': Cupcakes are even perfecter!
:'''Applejack''': Well... Well... Well, ''you're wrong!''
:'''Rarity''': [scoffs] I thought we were having fun, Applejack. But that was simply too much.
:[door closes]
:'''Applejack''': Ugh! Too much?! Comin' from a drama pony like you?! Am I right, Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa. This is between you and Rarity. But if you want my advice, you might need to go apologize. Life's too shortbread.
:'''Applejack''': You're right! Not about apologizin', but about gettin' advice.

:'''Applejack''': [voiceover] Dear Tabby, I just had a heated— uh, ''passionate'' debate with one of my best friends. And now we aren't talkin'. How do I get her to apologize? Signed, A Frustrated Filly. [aloud] And send.

:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Applejack''': Is Rarity here?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nope. But I heard about your heated—
:'''Applejack''': Passionate!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...passionate debate yesterday.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You two still not talking?
:'''Applejack''': Haven't heard a peep out o' that pony.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What if you apologize to her?
:'''Applejack''': Me?! No! Apologize?! No! I'm still waitin' on a response from Dear Tabby. She'll know what to do.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm...

:[owl hoots]
:[rooster crows]

:[cupcakes exploding]
:[thud]
:[clanging]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Applejack''': Oh, what a beautiful mornin'! I got a response from Dear Tabby!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What did she say?
:'''Applejack''': I haven't read it yet.
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': She hasn't read it yet! Read it! Read it!
:'''Applejack''': [reading] "Dear Frustrated, what an uncomfortable position to be in." See? She gets it. "Disagreements often happen between friends when somepony's feelin's are hurt. You're right. You ''do'' need to get talkin' again. And the first step to mendin' the fence is... by apologizin' to her." Wait, what?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What's the matter? Getting advice from Dear Tabby is what you wanted.
:'''Applejack''': Well, to begin with, the first thing you'll need to mend a fence is a post-hole digger.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Applejack. You got the advice you asked for.
:'''Applejack''': I know, I know. But I don't like the advice.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We get it. We gave you the same advice.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You know... sometimes the advice we ''need'' to hear isn't the advice we ''want'' to hear. You hear?
:'''Applejack''': I didn't hear ya before... but I do now.

:[epic music]
:'''Rarity''': I am Rare-eesi, Mother of Dragons! [grunts]
:'''Applejack''': [clears throat]
:'''Rarity''': Huh?
:'''Spike''': Yeah!
:'''Applejack''': A wiser pony than myself would've done this earlier, but I'm sorry for gettin' in your face. Our friendship is more important to me than some silly snack attack. I really hope this mends the fence between us.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I'm sorry, too. What made you come 'round?
:'''Applejack''': More like who. Dear Tabby! She gives advice just like a best friend.
:'''Rarity''': That's because she is! ''I'm'' Dear Tabby!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Well, color me surprised! It's nice knowin' everypony in Equestria has the sage advice of one of my best friends. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
:[cupcakes exploding]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! Aah!
:'''Applejack''': We don't need an advice column to know we should help Pinkie out.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]

==Zound Off==
:[boom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:[boom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Twilght Sparkle''': [laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting] What's... going... on?! Where's... the... explosion?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's nothing explosive here except our own laughter!
:'''Twilght Sparkle''': It's not explosions. We're goofing around with this sweet new app called ''Onomatopoeia''. It lets you play all kinds of sound effects. Like a boing!
:[boing!]
:'''Twilght Sparkle''': [laughs] Crash of thunder...
:[thunder]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles] Or there's this one that's just called "meatballs"!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What happens when you press it? 
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, just you wait.
:[beep]
:'''Tablet''': ''Meatballs!''
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Twilght Sparkle''': [laugh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?! Oh, my hoof-ness! I need to download this app immediately! I can't go another minute without being a part of the hilarity! Aaaaaand... click to download!
:[buzzer!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm out of hard drive space! I'm without space! THERE! IS! NO! SPACE! [yells]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No sweat. Don't fret. You can still download... "et"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think what Pinkie is saying is you just need to delete stuff to make more room for it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, I could delete ''Baubles with Besties'', but I like playing ''Baubles''. With my besties. And I could delete ''Gossip-peroni'', but then how will I learn all the latest celeb gossip while ordering delicious gooey pizza?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hmmm. I could delete ''Awooga''.
:[beep]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It counts how many times you say "awooga".
:[beep]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, sure—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But then I won't know how many times I've said "awooga".
:[beep]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. How about—?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Like just now! That's another "awooga"!
:[beep]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] I don't know. I want to join in on the fun, but this is so not fun!
:[door opens]
:[music]
:'''Tablet''': ''Awooga!''
:[beep]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It even says "awooga"?!
:[beep]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Okay, that's it! I want in! I need to delete something! But what?! Twilight! You've been so quiet! I need your help!
:'''Tablet''': ''Meatballs!''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! Sorry! Misread the moment.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Birds chirping. Rain falling. Friends laughing. What do these have in common? They're all sounds. But what is sound? For that, we need to talk about...
:[click]
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, Twi—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering] Silence.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whispering] Yeah, Twi? This is super fascinating, but maybe we can jump into the part where you tell me what apps I should delete.
:'''Rarity''': Yeah, you know, in the interest of—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Time!
:[clicking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've analyzed all the apps you have on your tablet – ranked by space taken up on the hard drive – and cross-referenced the amount of time you use that app.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, great! I like where this is going!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And even if you delete all the apps you've never used, it still won't free up enough space to download ''Onomatopoeia''.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't like where this went.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': There's a "but"? There's a "but"!
:'''Rarity''': [squeals] So we've heard, darling.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But... I found two apps. ''Speed Dreamin'<nowiki />'' and ''Ooooo''. All you need to do is delete one of them, and you can download ''Onomatopoeia'' and join the fun.
:'''Tablet''': ''Meatballs!''
:'''Rarity''': [laughs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't like this "but". It's a bad "but". No two ways a-"but" it. I can't delete either of them.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why not ''Speed Dreamin'<nowiki />''?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sometimes I sleep-run, and it tracks that.
:'''Rarity''': And pray tell, what does ''Ooooo'' do?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, it logs every time something makes me go "oooooh".
:[beep]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rarity''': Ahhhh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, those weren't "ooh"'s.
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rarity''': Huh?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': See?
:[buzzer]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The app's worth it. Didn't count 'em.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I get it. I'm a perfectionist pony. I hate the idea of not being fully prepared for any situation. But you're so worried about missing out on something in the future that you're not living in the right now.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-huh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls, strains, breathes hard, babbles, imitates klaxon, babbles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Pinkie Pie''', and '''Rarity''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are you doing?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... I'm letting off some steam?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, your steam is hilarious. I wish those were on ''Onomatopoeia'' so I could play them.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You do?
:[beep]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Awooga! Awooga! I don't need a soundboard app. I ''am'' a soundboard app! I'm ''Onomatopoeia''! ''ONOMATOPOEIA!'' [goofy noises]
:'''Rarity''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Pinkie Pie''': [cheering, laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [goofy noises] Hoo-ha! Hoo-ha! [babbles]

==Unboxing Day==
:'''Fluttershy''': Mm-hmm... mm-hmm, mm-hmm... [sighs] And... action!
:[clapperboard claps]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hello, everypony, and welcome to my first ever unboxing video! Let's start at the very beginning – getting ourselves a box to unbox!
:[doorbell rings]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! Right on time!
:[zip!]
:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': A box? For ''moi''? Thanks for the delivery, Muffins. As you can see, inside this box is a state-of-the-art cellular telephone. "Cell phone", if you will. Excellent packaging. Bold colors. Really catches the eye. The hoof feel of the box is solid. A sign it is well-made. Um... it has all the sides it needs. Which is very good. Essential. This is a... top-notch box. Um, very... cubic.
:'''Angel Bunny''': [sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Uh... [laughs nervously]
:[rattling]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! Hear that? The phone's inside! Time to rip this thing apart and see what it looks like! [strains] Huh? [straining]
:[dull squeak]
:'''Fluttershy''': [shudders, giggles] I love this sound. I just love the sound so much, I'm... [strains] ...listening to it a little longer than I normally would. [straining, pants] Phew. Ah, yes! Nothing like the smooth process of opening a box for the first time! [growls]
:[hammer squeaking]
:'''Fluttershy''': [growling]
:'''Applejack''': Hmm.
:[door opens]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, you doin' all right there, Fluttershy?
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. Heh. Fiiiine! Just fiiiine!
:'''Applejack''': Heh. All righty then, "Flustershy".
:[door closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': All part of the process, folks. I've opened many a package in my day. Just not on camera. We're almost unboxed, trust me. I know how to do this. [straining]
:'''Angel Bunny''': [sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': [straining, growls] Not to worry! We're gonna get this thing open soon, because these videos do best when they're under five minutes long! [straining]
:[loud thuds]
:'''Fluttershy''': [screams]
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, Fluttershy. How's the unboxing video coming along?
:'''Fluttershy''': [snarls]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [screams]
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Surprise, followers! This isn't your typical unboxing video. In fact, it's actually a ''boxing'' video! You heard that right! A boxing video! I don't actually want the phone that's inside the box. Nuh-uh. This new style of video is all about enjoying this box just as it is. Impenetrable. Invincible. Incredibly frustrating. [straining, yelling]
:'''Angel Bunny''': [sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] It was worth one last shot. Comment below if you think this is going well. And subscribe if you think it's going great! I know I do.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Are you filming something, darling?
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, um, just a little unboxing video for the interwebs. It's going... really well.
:'''Rarity''': I see... You know, if it weren't for the going really well, I usually find that most frustrating situations are almost always helped by phoning a friend.
:'''Fluttershy''': Hey! That's the phone that's in the box! That's what we're supposed to be unboxing! I mean, uh, the one I've purposefully been keeping inside the box.
:'''Rarity''': Ah...
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait. How'd you get yours out? 
:'''Rarity''': Oh, it wasn't easy. It took time, patience, persistence... and, of course, scissors.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, viewers, I hope you're taking notes at home.
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': I did it! Ooh! [giggles] Hooray! Woo-hoo! Huh? But... it's empty.
:'''Rarity''': And there you have it. Unboxing truly remains one of the great mysteries of our time.
:'''Angel Bunny''': [chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [growls]
:[crashing]
:'''Rarity''': And that's a wrap on this unboxing video. Or as I like to call it... [laughs] ...an "unwrap"!
:'''Fluttershy''': Too soon!
:[crashing]
