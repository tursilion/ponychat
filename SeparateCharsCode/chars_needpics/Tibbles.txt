[ominously]
I'm the one they call Grimm Hammer.
[normal voice]
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
I've got weaponry from the Hinterlands, curses from the Winterlands, and jelly beans.
They're lethally delicious.
Tibblet-Tibblie Grimm Hammer the third.
Please, call me Tibbles.
This is one wicked brew.
Lucky for you, [grabs one with his tail]
I just stocked up.
Add two more zeros and it's a deal.
Capitalism.
Where everyone wins, [goes further into his stand]
except you.
Is that what that game is called?
[chuckles and returns to the counter]
I was just using these as coasters.
Oh, what fun.
You're on.
[chuckles]
Looks like you forgot about my wild card.
In any case, I'd like my prize now.
And I choose...
the little bone boy.
[chuckles and takes King]
I've always wanted a tiny servant to model my line of baby clothes.
You don't think I know who you are?
Eda, the Owl Lady.
That's right.
[pulls out her wanted poster]
I've seen your wanted posters around here.
I wonder how much the Emperor's Coven would pay me to hand you over?
Bone boy!
You will do no such thing.
The Emperor's Coven is already on its way to send this witch here to the Conformatorium.
[holds up an outfit]
And I just rustled up some more clothes for you to try on.
[chuckles]
[climbing onto the counter]
I can and I am, bone boy.
I've got the cards stacked against you.
And nothing can stop me.
Nothing!
No, no, no!
My scam stand.
Curse you, witch.
Curse you, bone boy.
I'll have my revenge.
Tibblet-Tibblie Grimm Hammer the third will have his revenge.
Friends!
[lands in front of them]
Welcome!
I see you got my postcard.
Mm-hmm.
No, no, no.
I should thank you.
After my stand was destroyed, I reevaluated my life and found my true calling!
I'm now ringmaster of...
[snaps whip]
Tibbles's Tent of Tiny Terrors!
No cons here, Owl Lady, only pros.
In fact, why don't we toast our newfound friendship with this totally innocent bottle of water.
[pulls out potion]
Have a good time, friends.
[whisper]
While it lasts.
[in disguise]
Oh, my, my, my.
You seem troubled.
It is I.
Obvioso, the all-seeing psychic.
Obvious?
You're right.
And Obvioso can see that something is bothering you, little friend.
What if I were to tell you that there was a way to make all those problems...
disappear?
[ducks into booth and laughs; grabs potion bottle with spray nozzle]
Behold!
[chuckles]
Hey.
The spray is only temporary.
I just give my cheeks a tap and then...
...it returns safe and sound.
Take this.
[hands King the bottle]
Enjoy the carnival without the problems.
Luz, Willow, and Gus will be none the wiser.
[laughs, takes off fake mustache]
Uh...
yes?
[sighs]
I'd say it's working quite well.
Oh, did he?
But, what if he...
lied to you from the start?
[summons puff of smoke, is now wearing mustache and patting out Obvioso's hat]
Hold on.
[puts hat on]
Lied to you from the start?
It's different.
The potion was designed by me.
Guess whose cheeks control it?
[rips off mustache]
When you destroyed my stand, you destroyed generations of Grimm Hammer history.
Now it's time to pay.
Welcome to the greatest show on the Boiling Isles!
Will these witches and demon survive feeding time?
Let's find out!
You ruined my livelihood.
So now, you'll feed my livelihood.
Place your bets and enjoy the show!
[from atop his pile of snails]
No refunds.
Darn flies.
[taps cheek]
Oh, no.
It's the Tent of Tiny Terrors.
Something needed to be tiny.
They foiled my plans.
You will pay for this!
[pulls out another bottle]
This time I'm gonna personally squash you!
Oh, no!
Not desserts!
