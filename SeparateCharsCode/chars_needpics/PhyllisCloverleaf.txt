How many times have I told you?
You cannot just go trotting off without my permission.
Especially not here.
Because you are brainwashing their minds with all of your... uh, nonsense.
You know, you're an Earth pony, Argyle.
You should really start acting like one.
At least for her sake.
Who does he think he is, talking to me like that?
That pony is trouble.
Hmmm... Sheriff Sprout.
It does have a certain ring to it.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Oh, hey, how are ya?
Thank you so much.
We here at Canterlogic are so thrilled to create perfect products that protect ponies like you... from ponies like that!
Oh, I love it!
That's right!
So, let's start the show!
Up first, we have Sugar Moonlight looking absolutely stunning in our high-tech Anti-Mind-Reading Hat.
All those psychic unicorns out there are gonna be out of luck when you wear this little number.
Now let's welcome Sparkle Chaser in his Pega-Periscope Goggles, the easy way to keep your eye on the sky!
It's all part of the show!
Next up, the Earth Pony Balloon Escape Pack!
We take great care here at Canterlogic to ensure the safety of you, our loyal customers.
Now please stand back.
This product testing demonstration is fully automated.
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
So... Now you can prevent an aerial abduction with a set of our new Anti-Pega-Lift Boots!
Uh, e-e-everypony, take a look at our Unicorn Entrapment Device!
Uh, a-a-and this is the Splat-a-pult!
Let's hear it, everypony!
Come on!
Oh, we don't, do we?
How do you suggest that we defend ourselves?
With hugs and cupcakes?
Fry your brains with a single horn zap?
Or swoop down and snatch you away?
Sheriff, do your job.
It's quite sad, really.
Now, where were we?
Where's Hitch?
Ponies all over town, they're terrified!
They want answers!
Sugarcube, why the Sprout pout?
That's great news.
Yes!
It means that you are the sheriff!
At least for now.
My, oh, my, aren't you the handsome sheriff!
Look at you.
Well, this is it.
It is your time to shine, dear.
Everypony wants to hear from you.
Of course.
You are in charge now.
It's your destiny.
Come on now, everypony.
Let's listen to what our new sheriff has to say.
That's you, sugarcube.
Sugarcube, I know your little top-secret project is important and all, but when do you think my workers can get back to making Canterlogic products?
It is my factory, after all, dear.
But yesterday you were only the sheriff.
Oh, dear.
Somepony's getting a big head.
Maybe this is a bit too much, dear!
Let's put the toy away!
You come down from there right now!
I... said... STOP!
Look! A flying dog!
