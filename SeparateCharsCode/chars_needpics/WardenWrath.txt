I can hear you.
[stomping forward]
Just what are you fools whispering about?
[looks down at Eda's wanted poster that Luz had dropped]
The Owl Lady.
[picks up the poster and crumples it, turning his fist into a hammer and slamming it into the door of Luz's cell]
I'll get my hands on her soon enough.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.
There's no place in society for you if you can't fit in.
Too late.
Finally, [transforms his hand back into a hand]
I have you cornered, Eda the Owl Lady.
[takes King's crown]
My guards could never get you, but I knew if I took your pet's toy, you'd come running.
[crumples the crown]
I want you...
[pulls out a bouquet of flowers]
to go out with me.
[shoots the guard a thumbs-up]
You've always eluded our capture.
You've always been the one who got away.
I found that alluring.
You stay out of this!
So how about it, Owl Lady?
[picks Eda's head up by the hair]
The most powerful witch of the Boiling Isles and the feared Warden Wrath.
We'd be the strongest power couple ever.
I mean, it's-- it's not like you can say no right now.
Impudent wench!
Don't you know how many germs are in your mouth?
Blegh!
If you don't accept, then I have no choice but to des-- Oh!
[grunts as he gets up]
Owl Lady, I won't let you get away again!
No more running away, Owl Lady.
Today I capture you once and for all!
You!
Who do you think you are?
Very good.
Ah, Luz the Human.
How I've waited to see you again.
Now I'll have my revenge and you'll have front row seats to Eda's demise.
[screams]
She's in the holding cell in the dungeon.
