[descending the stairs]
I was in my oscillarium, reading the stars.
And who might you be, with eyes full of curiosity?
[running up to the two of them]
Young lady, dareth I say, I sense something unique about you.
Please, won't you join me for tea?
Please, call me Adegast.
Ma'am, yes, I run a small business.
I'm surprised to see you here.
It was my understanding that Eda delivered the packages herself.
And how are you finding the experience so far?
[approaching Luz]
Well, I have a quest--
[chuckles]
You didn't let me finish.
I have a question.
Would you like to go on a quest?
[reaches into his beard and pulls out a scroll]
I might have just the thing.
[unrolls the scroll to reveal a map]
The prophecy speaks of a young human girl who will claim the Celestial Staff and free this world from an ancient evil.
Perhaps thou hath cometh here for a reason.
Should you believe yourself worthy to attempt this quest...
[begins walking through his house]
...you need to know the road is dark and perilous.
And only the Chosen One can pull the staff from its post.
Wonderful.
[appearing from the fog]
Luz, the human.
Your hubris has failed you, Witch Apprentice.
[cackling]
I am everybody!
You fool, don't you see?
I'm no wizard.
And you're no Chosen One.
I've tricked you.
[evil laughter]
Your mentor has been stealing customers from my potions business for years.
She must be destroyed.
And you lured her right into my trap, all because you wanted to think you were special.
Eda, I have you now!
Oh, she can leave.
If she wants to.
But I sense she wants a real fantasy.
[screams]
[screams]
Back off!
[holds up King]
Or the dog gets it.
