Oh, Dottie!
Look at this lost little dumpling!
Poor baby!
Do you need us to make you a delicious meal?
Welcome to our kitty café.
This is our little safe haven for cherubs like you.
You see, precious cargo like you should be taken care of.
Boop!
All you should have to worry about is how many belly rubs you want or how much tasty num-nums you're gonna eat.
[puts Eda into a crib]
This place is a safe place.
A place clean from the outside world.
And those teenagers who filthen it.
[points to a sign behind her reading NO TEENS A-MEOW-ED]
You have a good nap, my dearest.
And welcome...
to your new home.
[through the door]
Baby demon!
We have a surprise for you!
A gift for our new, cutest demon.
[holds out a bee costume]
Dottie, please help our little angel get changed.
Oh, no, sweetie.
You can't survive out there without us.
No, baby.
You're a cutie patootie.
[reaches for Eda]
Let us in this instant!
It is not time for you to be there.
Oh, wonderful!
Now everyone can see our bestest baby...
[holds up the bee costume]
forever.
Dottie!
A teen has come to steal our little babies.
[wields a broom]
No, you're not.
You're a rotten teen!
But when we finish with you, you'll be calling for your mother.
[grabs knitting needles and drags them over her teeth]
Oh, look, Dottie.
It's not kidnapping if they entered our store.
Just think of it as good customer service.
Why did our lamp get unnecessarily extravagant?
[gasps]
After them!
[in the Oracle student's body]
You get outta my body, you galoot!
