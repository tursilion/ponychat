Is it this?
[increases the size of his head greatly, crushes the student next to him]
Like me?
A-Augustus, is this what the president of the Human Appreciation Society thinks passes as Human Artifacts?
Because at my old school, [pushes aside Gus's stuff]
we had real treasures.
Go ahead.
In my club, we didn't have any dumb rules.
Exactly, who thinks I should be president?
[stammers]
You can't prove that!
[inhales]
You're just trying to distract these human appreciators.
You're afraid of getting kicked out of office.
It's your word versus mine.
Yeah, right.
Who can you find that's a bigger human expert than any of us?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
A-And you've never brought your friend here.
Why?
[scoffs]
Ah, sure you will, Augustus.
Sure you will.
Augustus, you should really watch where you going.
Don't want the president of the H.
getting hurt on his last day in office.
[picks up and dusts off the crown; looks at Luz]
This must be your human.
Hmm.
Looks like another witchling to me.
[gasps]
A human!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
[sinks to the floor]
They can't know I lied.
Then they'll never make me president.
Huh?
[picks up one of the wanted posters Gus didn't; laughs]
Ooh, Gus, I have you now.
Stop!
Don't make another move, human!
[jumps onto the table; calms down]
I...
have something to say.
I'm new here at Hexside.
M-Making friends has been hard so I lied.
They're all fakes.
I thought if I was important enough people would like me.
But I've caused enough drama.
So, I'll go.
I'm sorry.
Thanks, guys.
I knew you'd understand.
Hey, Augustus, Luz, thank you for being so forgiving.
Well, I just have one thing to say...
[points at Luz]
There she is!
[pulls out Luz's wanted poster]
She's the intruder!
Oh, who's the liar now, Augustus?
I can't believe you two fell for that.
Like I'd actually apologize.
[mockingly]
Ah, boo-hoo.
I'm sorry.
I am the new kid.
I want friends.
[normal]
I want power.
And I want drama.
And I got one of those right now.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr.
President?
But I didn't pull the alarm!
It was Augustus!
Are you even listening to me?
I demand justice!
Wait!
[bangs on the door]
Get me outta here!
Open up!
Welcome to my world.
Believe it or not, at my old school I was in detention plenty of times.
Well, down in detention, this jerk is king.
So, if you wanna get out, you better do exactly what I say.
[walks forward]
But first, before anything else, we gotta-- [yelps]
[grunts]
Already?
[screams as he's dragged down]
I will be a good student.
Am I a good student?
Does that make me president?
[weakly]
Yes!
Hey!
Wait.
Take me.
I'm your president.
Come on.
