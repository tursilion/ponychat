[squishing Amity's face]
Because we love you baby sister!
Quit giving her a hard time, Mittens.
What if we all trained together?
We could show off what we know!
Luz!
[popping up from behind Amity]
Aw, Mittens.
That's impossible!
Is this some kind of...
special magic?
See you around, human!
Good luck with your, uh, training.
[offscreen]
Amity!
Dinner's ready!
Ed, give me the bat.
Get back here before that thing bites you!
Mittens, we've got bigger problems.
[running in front of Luz and Amity]
Aw, he's so cute.
Can we keep him?
Come on, Luz!
Don't worry.
We'll be fine!
Wait, what?
Use that fire spell we taught you!
Yes, you can.
Just focus.
Cool.
I didn't think you could actually do it.
You showed some real bravery in there, sis.
We're gonna tell everyone!
I think we can go the normal way.
[overlapping]
Being stuck with you forever.
A noble quest.
Yeah, makes sense.
She seems too cool for you.
[chuckles]
I'm Emira.
And this is Edric.
We're Amity's older siblings.
We heard how you embarrassed her at the school and at the witch covention last week.
No wonder she hates you.
Don't waste your time with Mittens.
Me and Ed, we're way more fun.
Follow us.
You're pretty fun, human.
So, hey, we're coming back tonight.
There's a certain book we forgot to...
check out.
Keep going.
[leaning against the opposite pillar]
This is fun to watch.
And dairy.
Wow!
[giggles]
Look what we discovered.
Now he's extra cute.
[closes the book]
Your turn, Luz.
Whatever.
We didn't come here just to doodle.
Come on.
I'm studying the dork arts.
This is Amity's secret hideaway.
She needs to learn not to mess with people like that.
So, we're going to find her diary.
See, we're her family.
It's tough love.
She needs to learn to lighten up.
Luz, were you hiding this from us?
It's for her own good.
Mittens killed the fun.
Yeah, with you.
All right.
[winks]
See you around, cutie.
