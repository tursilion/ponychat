Booooring!
Ugh!
Here we go again.
You're wrong!
My mom says the Pegasi and unicorns tried to eat up all the Earth ponies by zapping 'em with lasers and frying 'em to a crisp.
So the Earth ponies kicked their butts in an epic battle, and if they ever try to come back to Maretime Bay, we'll kick their butts again!
Well, I do.
It's a boring game.
Ooh!
Let's play Pegasus Barbecue instead!
Earth pony burgers!
Horn fight!
I did what you asked for, Hitch.
She never left my side, not even once.
That's Deputy Sprout to you.
Uh-uh!
You can't even step a hoof in there!
My mom had you banned!
Hey, watch it!
Oh, no!
I appear to be trapped!
Yeah, you're completely surrounded!
She's already reading our minds!
Quick, before she fries our brains!
To get reinforcements!
Question – when you say we, you mean...
Uh, I... I'd love to, but, um, I just gotta... clean up my workspace, get my papers in order, and, um...
Everypony loooooves Hitch.
What does he have anyway?
Sure, he's got a perfect mane, shredded abs, paid-off mortgage... So what?
I've got stuff!
I can do, um... things!
Like that!
And that!
And that!
He went after Sunny.
Another solo Hitch mission.
It is?
I am!
Hey there.
The name's Sprout. Sheriff Sprout.
What's the problem, filly?
Don't worry.
Sheriff Sprout is here.
Pick up that litter!
Sheriff Sprout's orders!
Mom?
Yes.
Yes, I am, Mommy.
They do?
Citizens!
It is I, Sheriff Sprout!
Oh, yeah, it's me.
Okay, folks, calm down.
There's no need to be scared.
Now is not the time to be complacent!
We should do something!
Why aren't you finished yet?
Just make it work, okay?
Back to work, Glitter Cupcake!
But it's my town, Mommy!
Your son's now emperor of Maretime Bay!
Well, see how fast I'm climbing the ranks?
This defense factory is going on offense, and it's all thanks to your love and encouragement.
Step!
Can we try that again?
Awwww.
Little Sheriff Hitchy came trotting back.
Just in time to see me do what you couldn't – attack our enemies!
No magic?
Hah!
That's even better!
W-Wait, what!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't listen!
They've been brainwashed!
You'll all be next if we don't end this now!
Say hello... to Sprouticus Maximus!
Troops! On to Bridlewood!
Would you look at this?
Our enemies delivered themselves to us!
I do not accept your surrender!
Load the Splat-a-pult!
Why do I have to do everything myself?
Oh, no, you don't!
What, and let them have magic?
Never!
Mommy, please! I'm in the middle of something!
But, Mommy, I'm... in... chaaaaarge!
Mommy?
Was I a good sheriff?
Don't worry, Mommy.
When I become sheriff, I'll keep everypony in line.
