Guards, state your business, and please make it quick.
We're on a very tight schedule today.
Before the celebration, Cloudpuff needs his pedicure, Pipp needs to rehearse, and I need to practice my laugh.
Still not right.
An Earth pony... and a unicorn... in Zephyr Heights?
Is this an attack?
On the night of our royal celebration?
Why are you here?
Who sent you?
Nopony must know they're here!
There's nothing to fear.
Those nasty little ponies have been captured.
Your queen will protect you.
Shut it off!
Please escort these ponies to the dungeon until I can question them properly!
And confiscate the book!
Keeping the queen cleeeeean...
I hear you paid our guests a visit.
Oh, you know she tells me everything.
I wish you would tell me more.
You're going to be queen one day.
You'll wear this crown.
And trust me, it is heavier than it looks.
I don't know what silly ideas that unicorn put into your head, but we have a duty to protect our citizens.
Pegasi are happy enough knowing that we royals can fly.
Why would you want to disrupt things?
It makes them feel safe.
One day you'll understand.
Your sister does.
Oh, and here she is now!
Remember to smile!
No comment! And no photos! Okay, one photo.
Save yourselves!
Oh, my darlings!
Thank hoofness!
Oh, I'm so glad I found my little fillies.
Now, I know that if you just come back with me, we can explain everything.
Spin the story, and they'll love us again.
Your crystals?
That crystal belongs to me!
I certainly doubt it!
Unicorns are known to be cheaters!
I'd like to see you try!
I know you're upset, darlings, my sweet little darlings, but it's time to go home now.
Excuse me!
Do you see my mouth still moving?
That means I'm still a-talking!
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, no, we're not here to fight, Mr Big Robot Pony.
Aw, I see you've made a new friend.
