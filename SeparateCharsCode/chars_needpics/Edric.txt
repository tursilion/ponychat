[leaning in]
And we still apologize everyday.
Yeah, of course she knows two spells.
Right, Luz?
Oooh!
Brain idea!
What do you say, Luz?
Hey Luz!
Hey, it's us!
[also popping up from behind Amity]
She still needs to use a training wand to learn new spells.
So what are you workin' on?
Something powerful?
[offscreen]
I caught a bat!
If we're not gonna eat it, I wanna keep it as a pet!
[runs off]
What did we miss?
[runs up with Emira]
It's no bat, but we could try.
Do those powerful spells you were talking about!
No, we're gonna die.
[offended gasp]
Amity!
Yes, please!
Yeah, nice work kiddo.
[ruffles Amity's hair]
It's not a secret!
[to Emira]
Wanna say our greatest fears?
On three.
One, two...
being alone forever!
[groans]
You gonna let her get to you like that?
Well-wishers on a mission.
Watch this.
Hey, Mittens.
[holds up the lunch bag]
Mom says stop forgetting your lunch.
And stop being a jerk to your friend.
So, you're the human we've heard so much about.
No, when Mittens gets mad, she looks like this.
[inhales sharply, grunting as his face turns red; exhales]
Whoa, I almost passed out.
And bonus, rumor has it the Wailing Star's supposed to unlock some rare magical event.
You in, friend?
Great.
Meet back here at midnight.
See you, Luz.
You ready to bring this whole, uh, whatever you're doing, inside?
It says no trespassing but I'm allergic to the rules.
[pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Emira]
Wow, okay.
Just expose me.
Come on.
There.
The Wailing Star!
Hmm.
Nothing happened.
Wow.
The Wailing Star magicked the books to life.
[grunts, falls; opens book and returns fire]
Luz, check this out.
[offering his pencil]
Come on.
Don't stop the fun.
Let me help.
I think I'm into this one.
We don't hang out in a library.
Uh, teacher, I'm in love with a dictionary.
Mittens has gotten too...
full of herself.
She keeps tattling on us when we cut class.
And then post the pages all around school for everyone to see.
What've you got there, Luz?
This is it.
You see how she treats people.
How she treats you.
She needs this.
Again.
Oh, well.
We're headed out to go goblin-tipping.
Wanna come?
