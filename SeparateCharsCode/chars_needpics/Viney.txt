Shh.
This is the last room you'll ever see alive.
[pauses]
Nah, just messing with ya.
I'm Viney.
Thanks for standing up for us back there.
Not many people would do that.
Follow me!
I wanna show you something.
You're one of us troublemakers now, so you'll get special access to the Secret Room of Shortcuts!
Hey Jerbo!
Barcus!
You can stop hiding now!
This place connects the different parts of the school.
We found it after being thrown in the detention track.
The witch who made it is known as...
[gestures to a defaced portrait and wall of signatures]
Lord Calamity.
[chuckles]
Sure, we can, but we can also do so much more.
We aren't allowed to study any kind of magic, so we study every kind of magic in secret.
Yeah, we might have liked it too much.
[voiceover]
Mixing healing and beast keeping was slightly unconventional.
[voiceover]
But Puddles was a great assistant, dang it!
We all want to be in more than one coven track!
But Bump just says we need to focus.
I'm glad you're one of us.
You've made a great first impression.
[pulls out a marker]
Would you like to add your name to the troublemaker wall?
[closes door]
You think you're better than us?
It's fine, I just...
I thought someone finally understood us.
But, maybe you should just leave.
[points to the door]
You're back.
What happened to them?
Don't let it see us!
[closes the door]
I think that's a greater basilisk.
I heard about them in a class.
My cousin at St.
Epiderm said she saw one, but those things should be extinct.
He'd kick us outta school.
Attagirl, Puddles!
Jerbo, now!
Healing and Beast Keeping!
