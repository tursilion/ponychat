:'''Pegasus Twin 1''': Aah! Watch out!
:'''Zipp Storm''': Heads up, everypony!
:'''Pegasus Twin 1''': I'm so sorry. Thank you, Princess Zipp.
:'''Zipp Storm''': Zipp. Just call me Zipp. And don't worry about it. The magic from the Unity Crystals in the Brighthouse is new to all of us. It takes practice.
:[bzzzt]

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Should I start now, or...?
:'''Pipp Petals''': [groans] Where is she? I really wanted to use my—
:'''Zipp Storm''': Lucky microphone?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': There she is.
:'''Pipp Petals''': What took you so long? Don't tell me you were sneaking around the palace again. [sighs] You know you can just enter through the main doors. It's our house.
:'''Zipp Storm''': But if Mom knew I was there, I'd get stuck doing one of her random princess lessons.
:'''Pipp Petals''': Good point. Okay, Sunny. Just remember. Pretend you're talking to us and not, like, all of Equestria, and you'll do great.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Uhhh...
:'''Pipp Petals''': You're live...
:[beep!]
:'''Pipp Petals''': ...now!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Like, "now" now? Uh... Hey, everypony! I'm Sunny Starscout, and I live here in Maretime Bay with my friends. [laughs] A lot has changed around here in the past few months. Maretime Bay used to be the place just us Earth ponies live, just like how unicorns always stayed in Bridlewood and Pegasi never left Zephyr Heights. But when we found the three Unity Crystals and brought ''them'' back together, it brought ''us'' back together! All pony kinds were reunited in friendship! Now anypony can live... anywhere! And... we have magic again! [squeals]
:[thud]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Doot-doo-doo! Well, the unicorns and Pegasi do. [giggles] Ta-daaaah! Now you, Sunny. Show everypony what you can do.
:'''Pipp Petals''': Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! Turn into an Alicorn! [squeals] That's an Earth pony, Pegasus, and unicorn all in one!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Uhhh... [laughs nervously] You know it doesn't really work like that, guys. I can't just, uh... Anyway! The point is, magic powers or not, I think everypony can agree that our lives are way more magical now that we're together again.
:'''Pipp Petals''': [singing] You know iiiiit! Okay, Sunny! Do the thing!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Do you like super fun times? Are you interested in learning more about Earth pony traditions and tasting local treats? Do you want to see ponies sing in a big concert?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Yes! You bet! And yeeees! [scatting]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Then you should come to our annual Maretime Bay Day Festival! For a day of fun in the sunshine! It's going to be a blast! And I'm not just talking about the fireworks show. [laughs] All pony kinds are welcome!

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': That's better.
:[click]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': All roasty and toasty. I'll just keep you safe here until we can find who you belong to, okay?
:'''Posey Bloom''': Sheriff Hitch!
:[slam!]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Posey Bloom''': Who were you just talking to?
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Nopony! Nopony at all! How can I help you, Posey?
:'''Posey Bloom''': I was just trotting down Main<!--Mane?--> Street when I noticed my hooves were stuck to the sidewalk. I tried and tried to move, but I couldn't for, like, a really long time. I think somepony's pranking me. Probably one of those unicorns. I'd like to file a complaint.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Okay. The complaint box is over there on the wall.

:'''Pipp Petals''': We've got our friends back, we've got magic back, and we've got...
:'''Pipp Petals''', '''Jazz Hooves''', and '''Rocky''': [vocalizing] Muuuuusiiiiic-kuh!
:'''Pipp Petals''': At Mane Melody...
:'''Jazz Hooves''': ...we siiiiing...
:'''Rocky''': ...while we style!
:'''Sunny Starscout''', '''Hitch Trailblazer''', and '''Izzy Moonbow''': Pipp-Pipp-hooray!
:'''Pipp Petals''': This one goes out to my ''paranoid'' big sis Zipp.
{{#lst:My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki:Workshop/Everything is Gonna Be Okay|song}}
:'''Zipp Storm''': You don't get it, do you?! We can't just sing a song and ignore everything! If we lose magic this time, we may never get it back again! And it'll be our fault.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': What is she talkin about?
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Lose magic?
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Whose fault?
:[crash!]
:[ponies groaning]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Are you ponies okay? What happened, Windy?
:'''Windy''': I don't know. I was just flying along, and the next thing I knew, I was down here on the ground.
:'''Unicorn 1''': Yeah, me, too. Because ''you'' fell on us.
:'''Windy''': Ugh, I'm so sorry, everypony. I'm normally such a good flier.
:'''Posey Bloom''': Clearly she's not. This is what I've been saying, what everypony's been thinking. If Pegasi and unicorns can't be respectful, then they shouldn't be allowed to use their magic in Maretime Bay!
:'''Earth Pony 1''': She's right!
:'''Unicorn 1''': I'm not sure...
:'''Earth Pony 2''': Yeah! No more magic!
:'''Posey Bloom''': It isn't fair! We Earth ponies don't get any magic, and then the ponies that ''do'' have it don't even know how to use it! Or they use it to prank us!
:'''Earth Pony 1''': Yeah! Posey's right!
:'''Earth Pony 2''': I agree!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Everypony, wait!
:'''Posey Bloom''': And now they want to ruin our special Earth pony holiday, too!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': That's not true!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': We want it to be the best day ever.
:'''Earth Pony 1''': Well, then Maretime Bay Day should be magic-free!
:'''Earth Pony 2''': Like it's always been!
:'''Dahlia''': A no-fly zone!
:'''Posey Bloom''': Or we're not coming.
:[thunder]
:'''Zipp Storm''': I think I finally know what's happening to magic. Why it's glitching.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': You do?
:'''Zipp Storm''': It's the Crystal. They might be powered by ponies.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Whaaaaaat?
:'''Zipp Storm''': Okay. Check this out. Pipp, when we were fillies, I used to steal Mom's chocolate-dipped cherries and blame it on you.
:'''Pipp Petals''': [deep gasp] I knew it! You got me grounded, like, twelve times!
:'''Zipp Storm''': Yeah, yeah, yeah. And guess what. I don't like karaoke! It's the worst! UGH!
:'''Pipp Petals''': [deep gasp]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Hey, you take that back! Karaoke is a fun activity for every age and skill level!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Zipp's allowed to like what she likes. Just because we enjoy something doesn't mean she has to.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Sunny, there's no need to get all huffy about it. Izzy was just trying to stand up for Pipp.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Don't call me huffy!
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Ugh! I didn't ''call'' you huffy! I said you were ''being'' huffy!
:[fizzling]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': There's a difference, and-- Whoa.
:[fizzling]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': You... You were right.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': So, when ponies aren't treating each other with kindness...
:'''Pipp Petals''': When we aren't vibing...
:'''Zipp Storm''': ...the Crystals get weaker. And the more unstable magic becomes in Equestria.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Which causes Pegasi to lose their flight and fall on other ponies!
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': And unicorns to drop stuff onto sandcastles!
:'''Pipp Petals''': And weather changes! [gasps] Like a rando thunderstorm?!
:'''Zipp Storm''': Yup! Everything is all out of whack!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': I wonder if this had anything to do with why the Crystals were separated all those years ago. Ugh. Or why I still can't seem to figure out my Alicorn magic.
:'''Zipp Storm''': I don't know. I want to find out. But if we want to keep magic in Equestria, first we need to get everypony back on the same page.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Zipp's right. We can't give up. We can still make Bay Day the celebration it's supposed to be.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': A day of friendship!
:'''Pipp Petals''': And [singing] haaaaarmooooony!
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Yeah!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Yeah!
:'''Zipp Storm''': Yeah!
:'''Pipp Petals''': Let's do it!
:'''Mane 5''': Hoof to heart!

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [singing] Hey, hey, heeeey!

:'''Pipp Petals''': Whoo!

:'''Mane 5 sans Izzy Moonbow''': [laugh]

:'''Sunny Starscout''': We have friendship and magic in our lives again.

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Whoa! [screaming] Oof!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Everypony's just still learning how to use it.

:'''Posey Bloom''': I wish magic had never come back. And I'm not the only pony around here who thinks so.

:'''Sunny Starscout''': How could she not love magic?

:'''Sunny Starscout''': We're going to use Maretime Bay Day as our chance to show off all the amazing things magic can do!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': I love it! What?!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Come on. We have a festival to plan, and it needs your magic, too.

:'''Pipp Petals''': [singing] Showtiiiiime!

:'''[Ponies]'''
::Everypony everywhere
::You can feel it in the air
::Find your spark and just glow and shine

:'''[Ponies]'''
::Make a mark that you can share
::Hoof to heart, you know we care
::Oh, ponies, come on, let's all unite

:'''Zipp Storm''': The magic! I-It's gone!

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': I do not like this! No!

:'''Zipp Storm''': That's it! Come on, unicorns! Come on, Pegasi! Help the Earth ponies!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': The big day is here!

:'''Pipp Petals''': Don't you love it here at Mane Melody? 

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Oooh...

:[bird chirps]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Did I just... understand you?!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Dragons haven't been seen for generations!

:'''Pipp Petals''': Adorbs!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Cute!

:'''[Ponies]'''
::Hoof to heart, you know we care
::Oh, ponies, come on, let's all unite

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Whoa! Whoops!
:'''Rest of Mane 5''': [laugh]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Mmm! Worth it!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Glitter! Glitter! Glitter!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Ugh...

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': What about the breakfast bot?!
:'''Zipp Storm''': Can someone get me down?
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Ponies!
:[smack!]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': [gasps] No!
:[screams, chaotic sounds]
:[door slams]
:[shimmering]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': I don't understand. I thought working together would be easy, but it turns out it's super messy.
:[paper flapping]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': [sighs] I wish you were here. You always knew how to bring out the best in me. And right now, I really need my best. Wait. Maybe that's what my friends need me to do – to bring them together to bring out their best! [kisses] Thanks, dad.
:[door opens]
:[screaming, laughing]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Okay, everypony! Just stop!

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': I'm in way over my head!
:'''Pipp Petals''': This is a total makeover fail!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': It's not a fail. It's a... work-in-progress. Come on, everypony. We can do this... together!
{{#lst:Work Work Work|reprise}}

==Zipp Gets Her Wings==

:'''Zipp Storm''': Stop trying to make "Zippsters" happen, Pipp! I don't want followers!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': And that's two pineapple punch smoothies with extra... nothing? Huh. Sorry, everypony. My fruit delivery was supposed to get here hours ago.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': I mean, you know what they say – a late delivery is probably a safe one.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Huh?
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Huh?

:'''Mane 5 sans Zipp Storm''': Ahhhh...
:'''Zipp Storm''': Oh. No-no-no-no-no! There's no way I would ''ever''...

:'''Zipp Storm''': [reading unenthusiastically] "Welcome to W-I-N-G-S. The Wonderful Institute of No-Gravity Skywalking"?
:'''Pipp Petals''': It means flight school.
:'''Zipp Storm''': It's really more of a one-off training day.
:'''Zoom Zephyrwing''': I was told it's an academy.
:'''Fifi''': Uh, is this the University of Flying?
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [chuckles] Huh?
:'''Zipp Storm''': Ugh, whatever. Let's just get started. Who can tell me how to do a double roulette twist?
:'''Windy''': Oh! I know about flapping!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Uh, Zipp?
:'''Zipp Storm''': What is it?
:'''Windy''': Oh, it's when you move your wings up and down over and—
:'''Zipp Storm''': Not you, Windy.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Maybe you start with something simpler. Like an obstacle course?
:'''Zipp Storm''': Obstacle course? I don't have an—
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Ta-daaaaa!
:'''Zipp Storm''': What?! Where did that come from?!
:'''Pipp Petals''': Over to you, captain.

:'''Foal in Zipp Mask''': ''I love you, Zipp!''
:'''Zipp Storm''': And which part exactly would I want to remember?
:'''Pipp Petals''': Oh, I don't know. How about the loving send-off from your mother? ''The queen?''
:'''Queen Haven''': Enough! Zephyrina, you are the future queen! Now sit up straight and wave!
:'''Pipp Petals''': [sighs]

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Look! There they are! Hi, Zipp! Hi, Pipp!

:'''Zipp Storm''': [gasps, laughs] Easy, ponies. It's a bedsheet.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [smacking lips]
:'''Pipp Petals''': Yeah, ''my'' bedsheet! Thanks, Izzy! I am, like, soooo super-traumatized right now. I'll be lucky to get ''any'' sleep.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': [yawns] Just shut your eyes, count Pega-sheep, and...
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [snoring] Glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter... Yes, yeah, glitter... Yes, glitter... Glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter...

:[camera clicking]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [continues vocalizing] Oh! [continues vocalizing] Morning! Don't you just love waking up to a new morning? It is just so new and [singsong] morning-y! [continues vocalizing]
:'''Zipp Storm''': Waking up? We didn't sleep!
:'''Pipp Petals''': Uh, was that my tiara?
:[fizzle]
:'''Pipp Petals''': Ugh.
:'''Zipp Storm''': Everything's ruined!
:'''Pipp Petals''': Sunny, you have to do something! Izzy's becoming a total nightmare roommate!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [continues vocalizing]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': [groans]

:'''Sunny Starscout''': They're probably just cranky 'cause they didn't get much— ...''any'' sleep, and... Where's my toothbrush?
:[door opens]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Hey, Sunny! Love your ear cleaner!
:[electric toothbrush whirring]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Oh, yeah! Mmm! Uh-huh! Yeah, my ears have never been so minty fresh! [giggles]
:[door closes]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Okay! Something's gotta be done!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': But confronting Izzy is just too awkward and embarrassing. Ooh! Let's ask Hitch! He'll know what to do!

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Huh... Hah! Whoa!
:[beat]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Uh... [nervous chuckle] Whoa! [sighs]
:[thud]
:'''Sunny Starscout''', '''Pipp Petals''', and '''Zipp Storm''': [gasp]

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Well, it sounds to me like you just need to be honest with Izzy. As a pony of the law, I can tell you – honesty is always the best policy.
:'''Rufus''': Hey! Keep it down, will ya?! I'm tryin' to get some peace in here!
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Hold on one second.
:'''Rufus''': Aw. Oh, this is lovely. [sips] My favorite! Thanks, Hitch. Uh, sorry I bothered ya.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Of course, sometimes a thoughtful gift can work wonders.
:'''Sunny Starscout''', '''Pipp Petals''', and '''Zipp Storm''': Ahhh!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': You guys got me... a box?! I love it! Best gift ever!
:'''Zipp Storm''': Uh, Izzy? The gift is ''inside'' the box?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Ohhh! [laughs] Uh-huh... Hmm... Huh.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Your own stuff! So you don't need to use ours anymore!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Zipp Storm''': 'Cause it was getting kinda annoying. Hey, honesty is the best policy, right?
:[clock ticking]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Ah! Well, in that case... I don't really like these presents!
:'''Sunny Starscout''', '''Pipp Petals''', and '''Zipp Storm''': Huh?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Honesty! I was just taking...

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [narrating] ...selfies of my breakfast like Pipp, doing my hair like Zipp...

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': ...scrubbing my ears like Sunny! I've never lived with best friends before. I was just trying to fit in with you all.
:'''Zipp Storm''': Huh.
:'''Pipp Petals''': Huh.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': We should've been honest from the start. Izzy, you don't need to try and fit in.
:'''Zipp Storm''': You're already perfect as you are.
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Oh, great! 'Cause trying to fit in is... so exhausting... I'm just gonna... [snoring]

:'''Pipp Petals''': [gulps]

:'''Pipp Petals''': Sooooo... [clears throat] um, what can I... do for you?

:'''Pipp Petals''': Uhhhhh... yeah.
:'''Phyllis Cloverleaf''': Before that, it was Fancy Filly Fashion Boutique, Painting Palomino's Pottery Cafe...

:'''Pipp Petals''': [crying]
:'''Zipp Storm''': Pipp! There you are. You have to come back inside.
:'''Pipp Petals''': I can't! You saw what happened! I took a huge chunk out of her mane! [sarcastically] Who's the style icon now?
:[smack!]
:'''Zipp Storm''': You are. Always have been. Always will be. So you shaved ''one'' bald spot. Big whoop. See all that confidence and swagger?
:'''Unicorn 1''': [squeals]
:'''Zipp Storm''': You brought that to Maretime Bay. You did that.
:'''Pipp Petals''': I did?
:'''Maverick Mauve''': Hey, nice new 'do, Posey!
:'''Zipp Storm''': I did!

:'''Pipp Petals''': [sighs] Thanks for covering for me, Sunny. And thanks for always being there for me, Zipp. You're the best sister ever— [deep gasp] Really?! You ''never'' let me style your mane!
:'''Zipp Storm''': ["I-don't-know" sound]
:'''Pipp Petals''': Oh, my pony! I always thought you'd look ''amazing'' with a pony perm! Or, like, okay, a manehawk! Or maybe in a different color! Okay, okay! How do you feel about bangs?

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [grunts] The release button isn't working!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': [gasps] Then how are we gonna get her out?!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': I'm fine. This'll be fun. [gasps] I've never been a box before.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': But I planned the tour with stops I knew each of you would love. Izzy can't do a tour in a box.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Oooh! You just gave me an idea!
:[shimmering sounds]
:[rumbling]
:'''Rest of Mane 5''': [gasp]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [gasps] Is it levitating? Did I do it? Am I a levitating box?

:'''Rest of Mane 5''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': I thought you'd love this, Izzy.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': I ''do'' love it, Hitch! My favorite place in all of Maretime Bay! We're looking at a parking meter, right? Oh, I love those things.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [groans] That is it! We have to get Izzy out of there now! [yells, grunting]
:[metallic rattling]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [babbling, grunting] Will nothing open this adorable cube prison?!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [giggles]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': My perfect tour... ruined!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Hey there, Hitchy-poo. What's wrong, buddy?
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': This tour was supposed to show you that Maretime Bay is an amazing place to live.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Hitch, mission accomplished!
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Huh?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': We just had a blast! And it's all thanks to you!
:'''Pipp Petals''': Yeah, I've always wanted to see the Houvre. It's, like, a totally famous museum.
:'''Zipp Storm''': And how cool was that ropes course? I'm definitely going to check that out.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': So... you all like Maretime Bay?
:'''Pipp Petals''': We love it!
:'''Zipp Storm''': I feel more at home now.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Best tour I've ever been on. Seriously.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': See, Hitch? When something doesn't go to plan, you just have to... wait for it... think outside the box! [laughs]
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [laughs] That is so funny! 'Cause I'm ''inside'' a box.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [laughs, gasps] "Outside the box"! [grunting] Aha!

:[bunnycorn yips]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Wait. Did you steal those things for me?
:[critters yipping]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Well, I'm flattered, but you can't go around taking things. You've broken a dozen laws, not to mention health code violations. Go return everything!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Huh? Ah! Huh?

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Awww! You ponies remembered? Oh, did you just pretended to forget?
:[beat]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Well... no. We forgot. We're all still learning about everypony's special days, and I guess we need to try a bit harder.
:'''Pipp Petals''': We're sorry, Izzy.
:'''Zipp Storm''': We thought you lost it.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': We'll do better. I promise.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': But we were thinking. Maybe there's still time to do our own T.U.E.S. Day. All together?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Are you kidding?! I had a whole day of fun, and now I get to do it all again with you ponies?! Whoo! This is the best T.U.E.S. Day ever!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [scatting, chomps] Mmmm! Good pancakes, Sunny!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Yuck.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [scatting]
:[door opens]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': They're doing it again with the garden tools!

:[raccoon-corns growling]

:'''Sunny Starscout''': You can't deal with that on an empty stomach.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': There's no time!
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Uh... good luck!
:[phone buzzes]
:[phone chimes]
:'''Pipp Petals''': [grunting] Excuse me. Oh! Sorry! Excusez-moi! [groans] Can't ''believe'' I missed your pancakes this morning, Sunny! But Mane Melody is totes slammed. Okay, later, bye! [blows kiss]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Laters. Everyone is so busy. It feels like we're drifting apart.

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Turn it aro— A-ha! There we go! Hey, ponies! I know everypony's got a lot going on. But we can't forget to make time for each other. Who's up for a hike to Prancing Point? Don't forget!

:'''Sunny Starscout''': Whew! I thought nopony was coming! Aw, you're the only one who remembered, Izzy!
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Remembered? Oh! Yes! Totally! Nothing slips out of this brain! [laughs nervously] Nope! Did... Did not forget! Nooooo way! [laughs nervously]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': And you brought a trailer full of rocks on the hike?
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': Uhhhh... [sighs] They're gemstones. And okay. I ''did'' forget! But I'm here now.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': That's all that matters. Prancing Point, here we come!

:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [nervous sound]
:[growl-like noises]
:'''Sunny Starscout''' and '''Izzy Moonbow''': Aah! [screaming]

:'''Zipp Storm''': [gasps]

:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [gasps]

:'''Zipp Storm''', '''Hitch Trailblazer''', and '''Pipp Petals''': No! The hike!

:[doors open]
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Sunny, w-we're... We're so sorry! Sunny? ''SUNNY!''
:'''Pipp Petals''': Izzy's not here either! Maybe they're together?
:'''Zipp Storm''': Let's hope so. It's getting late, and they should've been back ages ago. Something's not right.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Pipp Petals''': Don't worry, Hitch. We're, like totally gonna find them.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': [hyperventilating]

:'''Zipp Storm''': Izzy!

:[crack]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': Ugh. Izzy.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': [breathing hard, gasps] Did you hear that? Something is out there. I can smell it.
:'''Sunny Starscout''': It's just your imagination. There's nothing out there.
:[thud!]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': I heard that. Come on. Let's go the other way.
:[thud]
:'''Mane 5''': [scream]
:'''Pipp Petals''': Not the face!

:'''Zipp Storm''': Hitch, I'm telling you. ''This'' is the fastest way home.
:'''Hitch Trailblazer''': Agree to disagree.
:'''Pipp Petals''': It's kinda spooky out here, right? Aah! [laughs] I love it!

:'''[Izzy Moonbow]'''
::[rapping]
::Levitate your hooves in the air!
::Earth ponies don't clean their underwear!

:[gasps]
:'''Zipp Storm''': Uh, Izzy? I think it might be time for some new lyrics.
:'''Mane 5 sans Sunny''': [laughing]
:'''Sunny Starscout''': See? ''This'' is all I wanted. Good old-fashioned quality time. Let's eat!
:'''Pipp Petals''': Instead of Sunday dinners, we have "Sunny-day" dinners! [laughs] Get it? Do you get...? Totally a thing now.
:'''Izzy Moonbow''': That's it! I've got it! [clears throat]

::[rapping]
::Raise your hooves up high!
::And bring together all ponykind!

:'''Mane 5''': Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!
