[''Scene opens with an exterior shot of the [[Emperor's Castle]]. Inside his room, [[Hunter]] is sewing a sigil onto his cloak. [[Flapjack]] lands on his shoulder and chirps at him.'']

'''Hunter:''' Yeah, It does look good as new!

[''Hunter holds up his cloak to look at the sigil. The sewing work on it looks shoddy and strings start coming off, not to mention the cloak has bandages on it.'']

'''Hunter:''' ...And I have no idea what I'm doing.

[''Someone knocks on Hunter's door. He opens it and finds 2 [[Coven Guard|Coven Guards]] standing outside. One of them passes a letter to him. Hunter opens it and reads the letter, which is from [[Emperor Belos]].'']

'''Hunter:''' My duties are keeping my busy. I entrust you to lead the Coven Heads today. Consider this a test." [''smirks''] Hmm.

[''Hunter heads over to the throne room, just in time to see some of the Coven Heads coming out.'']

'''Hunter:''' Good. You're all here. We can get started- Hey! Ugh! Wha- Where are you- Ugh! I said wait! Come back here!

[''The Coven Heads ignore his presence and simply push past him. [[Raine Whispers|Raine]] stops and turns around to look at Hunter, but [[Terra Snapdragon|Terra]] pushes them and they walk away.'']

[''Hunter pushes the doors open and walks into the throne room angrily. He sees [[Darius]] and [[Eberwolf]] looking at some scrolls.'']

'''Hunter:''' Darius! Eberwolf! Why is everyone leaving? We are scheduled to have a recruitment meeting.

[''Darius sighs and turns around to talk to Hunter.'']

'''Darius:''' Good morning to you too, little prince. We've decided to reschedule the meeting, so go play arts and crafts or... whatever it is you do. [''notices something''] Oh. Looks like you've already started.

[''Darius uses his [[abomination]] goo to grab Hunter's cloak and brings it to him.''] 

'''Hunter:''' Hey!

[''Darius looks at the hand sewn sigil and laughs at it.'']

'''Darius:''' This is impressively bad. Wait, is this the old Golden Guard sigil?

'''Hunter:''' [''angrily''] Of course it is! And this is no way to treat the emperor's-

'''Darius:''' Nephew?

[''Hunter stares at Darius furiously.'']

'''Darius:''' I knew your predecessor. He was my mentor. One of the strongest witches I've ever known. But you... Hmm.

[''Darius looks at Hunter judgingly. Hunter becomes nervous.'']

'''Hunter:''' But Belos says I don't need magic to serve the coven.

'''Darius:''' And I say you don't deserve to wear that patch.

[''Darius walks away together with Eberwolf, holding Hunter's cloak in his hand. Feeling insecure, Hunter turns around and calls after Darius.'']

'''Hunter:''' Wait. What should I do? How do I... earn it?

'''Darius:''' [''exasperated''] Ugh, sweet mother of Titans. I- I don't know. Find new recruits for the [[Emperor's Coven]]? The best and the brightest witches in all the land. Then maybe, you can get this back.

'''Hunter:''' [''determined''] I'll do it.

'''Darius:''' [''walks away''] Of course you will. You're very good at doing exactly what you're told.

[''Hunter looks insecure again. The doors slam shut.'']

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|MAIN THEME]], but it is cut and a shorter version is used.''']

[''Scene cuts to a forest with upbeat music playing. Willow is working out relentlessly with [[Clover]] accompanying her.'']

'''Willow:''' [''narrating''] After years of thinking I wasn't good enough, I finally found something I can be good at. Something I wanna be good at. Switching to the Plant Track was just the beginning. I'm on my way to becoming the [[Witch|witch]] I wanna be. 

[''Scene cuts to Willow sitting in front of a mirror. She looks at her reflection and talks to herself.'']

'''Willow:''' I can do this!

[''Willow suddenly becomes unsure.'']

'''Willow:''' Right?

[''Willow takes off a piece of newspaper clipping pasted on the mirror. It shows an article titled: "The Ghouls Celebrate Their First Flyer Derby Win!" and in the picture above it, [[Gilbert and Harvey Park]] are among the members celebrating the win. Willow looks back at her reflection with confidence.'']

'''Willow:''' Eye of the liger, girl. [''winks''] Knock'em dead!

[''Scene cuts to Willow walking inside the hallways of [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]]. A banner above her reads: "CLUB FAIR TODAY!" She suddenly hears a noise and looks towards it, and sees [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] and [[Gus Porter|Gus]] running away from something.'']

'''Luz:''' BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK!!!

[''A rogue locker appears and chases after the duo. They run up to Willow and hide behind her. Willow promptly uses a [[Spell Circle|spell circle]] to summon some vines and tie up the locker's feet, restraining it.'']

'''Luz:''' [''hugs Willow''] Thanks, Willow.

'''Gus:''' [''sits on the locker''] And that's why we try not to keep our lunches in the lockers.

'''Luz:''' So... ready for the [[Club Fair|club fair]], Willow? Mayhaps you'll join me and [[Amity Blight|Amity]] in the... [[Azura]] book club.

[''Luz tries to hold up 5 books in her hand at once, but drops it seconds later while yelping in pain.'']

'''Luz:''' Owie.

'''Willow:''' Thanks. But... I'm interested in something with a little more... drama, flare, and face paint.

'''Luz:''' (''intrigued'') I'm so excited to hear the next words out of your mouth.

'''Willow:''' [[Flyer Derby|Flyer derby]]!

[''Willow shows Luz a video on her [[Penstagram]] account on her [[Scroll|scroll]].'']

'''Narrator:''' Only Stabitha Jenkins and Old Gory are left. 

[''Stabitha and Old Gory rushes towards each other.'']

'''Narrator:''' Who will win? 

[''Stabitha snatches Old Gory's flag and hangs it over at her team pole.'']

'''Narrator:''' And it's Stabitha Jenkins with the winning flag!

'''Willow:''' Ever since our [[grudgby]] match, I've been playing it at home. Today... (''summons her staff'') I'm starting Hexside's first Flyer Derby team!

[''Behind Willow, Luz and Gus cheer and throw confetti.'']

'''Luz:''' Whoo-hoo!

'''Gus:''' Yeah!

[''Scene cuts to the club fair event on the field outside school building. Willow is setting up her stand with Clover's help. Meanwhile, Luz is at her stand trying to attract people to come.'']

'''Luz:''' Journey with us to a world of magic unlike any other! Well, uh, a bit like this world, except toned down for ages 6 to 11. [''disappointed''] Why isn't anyone interested?

[''[[Boscha]] grabs a book from the stand and shows Luz the cover.'']

'''Boscha:''' The art doesn't do it any favors.

'''Luz:''' Not judging a book by its cover is a baby rule even babies know. Plus, you don't read Azura for the art! There's so much magic in the words.

[''Boscha flips open the book and reads a passage from it.'']

'''Boscha:''' [''poses as she reads''] "Twice have I tarried at Tanabrack. Yet e'er have I kept my troth to thee, Azura."

'''Luz:''' Okay, the prose can be... ornate. But it- it's also the crackling emotions! The convoluted magic system! The smell of the pages!

[''Luz buries her face into the pages and inhales deeply. Boscha stares at her judgingly.'']

'''Amity:''' Luz!

[''Amity runs up and calls out to Luz. She stops beside Boscha to catch her breath.'']

'''Amity:''' I heard that- [''pants'']

'''Luz:''' Spill it, ''hermosa''!

'''Amity:''' The author of ''Azura'' is having a signing this afternoon at the Book Nook!

'''Luz:''' [''confused look''] Huh?

'''Amity:''' You are much less excited than I imagined.

'''Boscha:''' Uh, excuse me, I'm still here.

'''Luz:''' I'm just confused. The author is [[Human|human]].

'''Amity:''' No, she's not. She's from the [[Demon Realm]]. How do you think I got my books?

'''Luz:''' How do you think I got mine? Look!

[''Luz takes a book and shows Amity the author's picture on the back, accidentally pushing Boscha backwards.'']

'''Boscha:''' Hey!

'''Luz:''' See? [''points at the author's ear''] Human!

[''Both Luz and Amity notice that the author has different ears when comparing the pictures behind Luz's book and Amity's book side by side.'']

'''Amity:''' Can the author of ''Azura''...

'''Luz:''' Travel between realms?!

[''Boscha pushes aside the duo angrily.'']

'''Boscha:''' Get off me!

[''Luz and Amity put their books on the stand, then run away together while holding each other's hands. Boscha shouts after them.'']

'''Boscha:''' You guys aren't cute! I still have more friends than you!

[''Camera pans to the right, where Hunter emerges from beside a stand watching the students of Hexside. He is disguised in the uniform of a Potions Track student.'']

'''Hunter:''' Look at all these potential recruits.

[''Flapjack appears on Hunter's shoulder and chirps.'']

'''Hunter:''' Sure, I've never actually spoken to witches my age. Teens are probably into the same things as me! Like authority and rules!

[''Hunter walks up to a small student watching scroll.'']

'''Hunter:''' Classmate! Ignore the fact that we've never met. What if I told you all your dreams could come true? And you'd just have to leave your home, friends, and family forever?

[''The small student looks at Hunter hesitantly and sweats.'']

[''Scene cuts to some Oracle track students playing [[Hexes Hold'em]] at their stand. They cheer after one of the cards have been destroyed in an epic battle. Hunter approaches them.'']

'''Unnamed Oracle student:''' Ha-ha!

'''[[Moon girl|Celine]]:''' Woo-hoo!

'''Hunter:''' You think these are cool? Not as cool as the Emperor's Coven. I hear you get to sleep in till 6 a.m.

[''[[Barcus]] spits out a "Banish Card", which hits Hunter's face. Scene cuts to [[Jerbo]] walking while looking at a pamphlet when he is stopped by Hunter.'']

'''Hunter:''' You! How would you like to rise to the top by joining the Emperor's Coven?

'''Jerbo:''' Eh. Not interested.

'''Hunter:''' You aren't?!

'''Jerbo:''' I mean, do I wanna study different kinds of magic? Heck yes! But why is joining the Emperor's Coven my only option? When I get older, I'm gonna give this system a long-overdue update.

[''Hunter retreats while looking at Jerbo incredulously.'']

'''Hunter:''' What are you talking about?

[''Hunter accidentally steps on [[Viney|Viney's]] pet [[Griffin|griffin]], Puddles' tail. She turns around and screeches at him.'']

'''Viney:''' It's okay, Puddles. No, he didn't mean it. No, no, no, no! No, Puddles, no!!! 

[''Hunter looks at Puddles approaching him with a startled expression. Scene cuts to Willow in front of her stand.'']

'''Willow:''' Let out your inner flying freak! Once the Flyer Derby club is approved, we'll travel all across the [[Boiling Isles|Isles]] in rocking outfits and working as a team!

'''Voice:''' Good luck with that.

'''Willow:''' (''turns to the source'') [[Professor Hermonculus]].

''' Professor Hermonculus:''' I'm overseeing club approvals this year,  and I just don't think Flyer Derby is worth investing in.

'''Willow:''' Just because it's not as well-known as Grudgby doesn't mean-

'''Professor Hermonculus:''' You misunderstand me. I'm shutting it down unless YOU step down as captain. I just don't think quitters make good leaders.

'''Gus:''' You're just mad that she dropped your class. Give her a chance!

'''Professor Hermonculus:''' Okay. Put together a team for a friendly game of Flyer Derby after school. If you can lead your team to victory, maybe I'll approve your club.

[''Professor Hermonculus leaves. Willow and Gus stare at him angrily, but then Willow sighs, looking despondent.'']

'''Gus:''' You can do this, Willow. Don't let him beat you down.

'''Willow:''' But Amity and Luz are busy and... I don't know where to find enough decent players this fast.

'''Hunter:''' Calm down, flea-magnet!

[''Willow and Gus hears someone shouting and looks upwards. Up above, Hunter is riding on his staff, trying to escape from Puddles chasing after him. Puddles bites on one of Hunter's shoe and tears it off.'']

'''Hunter:''' HEY!!!

[''Hunter notices Puddles coming straight at him. He makes a nosedive towards her and snatches his shoe from Puddles' beak, then makes a few spins and whizzes past Willow. Willow looks at Hunter in astonishment. She ties up Puddles with vines, then calls out to Hunter.'']

'''Willow:''' [''points''] Hey, you!

[''Hunter notices Willow calling out for him. He then sees Willow's vines coming towards him and tries to escape on his staff, but Willow promptly ties him up and brings him back to her. Hunter looks at her with a terrified expression as she approaches him and stares down at him.'']

'''Willow:''' [''holds up a pamphlet''] Wanna join my Flyer Derby team? [''grins'']

[''Cut to a while later. Hunter is patting the vines off him.'']

'''Willow:''' This is Gus Porter, and I'm Willow Park, future captain of Hexside's first Flyer Derby team.

[''While talking, Willow grabs Hunter's hand and shakes it vigorously.'']

'''Hunter:''' NICE- TO- UH- MEET- YOU!

'''Willow:''' Your flying was... amazing. You're a new student, right?

'''Gus:''' [''looks at Hunter suspiciously''] Yeah, weird we've never seen you around. What's your name?

'''Hunter:''' Uh...

[''Flapjack lands on Hunter's shoulder and chirps at him.'']

'''Hunter:''' Caleb? Uh, Caleb! Uh, Jasper... Bloodwilliams. I just transferred from... uh... [''sees Puddles licking her foot''] The... Toes? But! I'm not here to play Fly Dooby or... whatever that is.

[''Hunter turns around and starts walking away.'']

'''Willow:''' [''dejected''] Okay... At least take a pamphlet?

[''Willow offers Hunter a pamphlet. He snatches it off her hand and walks away again. He then reads the cover of the pamphlet which says: "<u>FLYER DEBRY</u> - A SPORT FOR THE BEST AND <u>BRIGHTEST!</u>", and immediately turns around.'']

'''Hunter:''' Wait! Do you really think your club will attract the best and the brightest?

'''Willow:''' Absolutely! Flyer Derby's not for the faint witch.

'''Hunter:''' Then... maybe I'll give it a try.

'''Willow:''' Really?

'''Hunter:''' But- Okay. How do we evaluate others? A Witch's Duel? A maze full of traps? Oh! Leave everyone at the top of the mountain and see who makes it back to the bottom alive! [''laughs''] Classic.

'''Willow:''' Um... we... might not have time for all that. But... you can help by attracting people with your sick sky skills.

[''Willow runs off with her staff.'']

'''Hunter:''' Hmm. [''touches his forehead''] I don't... feel sick.

'''Gus:''' Hey, I don't know what kinda mission you're on, but it's been a tough year for Willow. And she's really looking forward to making this team a thing. [''walks away''] Don't mess this up for her.

[''Hunter looks at Gus walking away with a confused look.'']

[Scene cuts to [[Bonesborough]]. Luz and Amity are walking through the Market Place.]

'''Luz:''' I can't believe we never uncovered this mystery before. I always thought Mildred Featherwhyle sounded too delightful to be a real name. 

'''Amity:''' Do you think she has her own [[Portal|portal]]? [''gasps''] Do you think she's related to that human guy? [[Emperor Belos|Philip]]?

'''Luz:''' What if... the author is [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]]? She's been keeping it a secret this whole time because she's embarrassed by all the spelling errors!

'''Amity:''' ...Okay, these theories are a little unrealistic. It's obviously [[Camila Noceda|your mother]] as a teenager sent forward in time to train you in the ways of witchcraft!

'''Luz:''' Whatever it is, we're gonna find out soon.

[''Luz notices that they have arrived at their destination. However, on the promotional poster, it says that the event has been cancelled. Luz falls to her knees and starts crying.'']

[''Scene cuts back to Hexside, where Willow is trying to attract students.'']

'''Willow:''' Students of Hexside! Got a palisman? Got a need for thrills, chills and theatrics?Well, THIS could be you!

[''Hunter emerges from behind Willow and whizzes above everyone's head, causing the audience to cry out in amazement. He then proceeds to fly upwards, jump off his staff, then lands back on it and keeps on flying. The audience start clapping and cheering.'']

'''Willow:''' Man, this Caleb guy is great. With him, I think we can really get our Derby team approved.

[''Willow starts handing out pamphlets along with Gus.'']

'''Hunter:''' This girl will be a perfect candidate for the Emperor's Coven. If there are more witches like her, we're set!

'''Willow:''' Hey! Come on down!

[''Hunter lands.'']

'''Willow:''' Allow me to introduce you to... the best, and the brightest of Hexside.

[''3 new members have joined the team. They are: Gus, Skara, and Viney.'']

'''Viney:''' Look, Puddles, it's the friend you made before! [''tries to hold Puddles back''] No, no, no! Do not claw Mommy's face!

[''Skara is lying on the staircase lazily while scrolling on her scroll.'']

'''Skara:''' Hmm.

[''She promptly slides down with her head hitting the ground. Gus on the other hand is mounting his staff.'']

'''Gus:''' Let's try this one more time!

[''Gus flies off, but he appears inexperienced at controlling his staff and eventually crashes into a wall.'']

'''Willow:''' Just a few months ago, I'd be considered the weak link on any team. But now I'm leading one! Ooh! Okay, girl, don't let the power get to your head just yet. Hmm?

[''Willow notices Hunter walking away.'']

'''Willow:''' Caleb?

[''Willow runs up to catch up with Hunter.'']

'''Willow:''' Where are you going? The field is this-a-way.

'''Hunter:''' [''frustrated''] You said you'd find the best witches for this team. But them? They're pathetic.

'''Willow:''' You just met them! Give them a chance!

'''Hunter:''' Well, where I come from, even chances have to be earned. Especially if you're considered half-a-witch like me.

[''Willow looks at Hunter with a surprised expression.'']

'''Hunter:''' Sorry, Captain. Good luck with your match.

[''Hunter walks away again. Willow smirks and draws a spell circle. Hunter is suddenly stopped by something.'']

'''Hunter:''' Huh?

[''Hunter looks down at notices that his feet has been tied down. He is then dragged into the ground and later pops back up on the playing field. He looks around preparing to fight, but finds the field empty.'']

'''Hunter:''' Huh?

[''Skara walks up to Hunter.'']

'''Skara:''' Sorry I was distracted earlier. Been playing Grudgby for so long, I needed to catch up on the latest Flyer Derby strats.

[''Skara shows Hunter posts on Penstagram with pictures showing strategies of playing Flyer Derby.'']

'''Hunter:''' Those look... complicated.

'''Skara:''' They are.

[''Hunter hears Viney speaking and looks towards her.'']

'''Viney:''' Whew! Okay, finally. Got Puddles down for her nap.

[''Viney draws a spell circle above her head and drags it down to her feet, healing her physical scars.'']

'''Viney:''' Now I'm only scarred emotionally.

[''Someone whizzes behind Hunter. He looks up and sees Gus sky surfing on his staff. He then lands in front of Hunter.'']

'''Hunter:''' I thought you couldn't fly?

'''Gus:''' So I can't fly like everyone else, but my way's more fun.

[''He glances towards his palisman and it chirps at him.'']

'''Hunter:''' Oh. That's uh, [''murmurs''] cool, I guess.

'''Gus:''' Oh, what was that?

'''Hunter:''' I SAID IT WAS COOL!

[''Willow pops out next to Hunter from the ground.'']

'''Willow:''' Gus is a natural speed demon, Skara's a strategic wizard, and Viney's the best healer in school. And at one point or another, we've all been misjudged. So, still think we're pathetic?

[''Hunter shakes his head ashamedly.'']

'''Willow:''' Good. Let's get our game faces on.

[''Willow paints her face with green paint.'']

[''Scene cuts to Luz and Amity sitting outside The Book Nook, both looking downhearted.'']

'''Luz:''' [''sighs''] What do we do now, Amity?

'''Amity:''' I- I don't know. I've never found another store that sold these books.

'''Luz:''' We were so close!

[''Luz buries her face in her arms. Suddenly, Amity hears something and looks towards it. She sees a hooded figure hopping away.'']

'''Amity:''' I think that's her. [''shakes Luz''] That's the author!

'''Luz:''' Mildred- [''hits her head''] Ow! Featherwhyle?!

'''Hooded figure:''' Hmm?

[''The hooded figure realizes it had been noticed and immediately starts running.'']

'''Luz:''' Follow her!

[''Luz grabs Amity's arm and both start running after the hooded figure.'']

[''Scene cuts to the playing field. Hunter is holding a [[Crow Phone|crow phone]].'']

'''Hunter:''' [''to the phone''] Call Darius.

[''Darius is seen relaxing in his room when a Crow Phone barges in through the window next to him, startling him.'']

'''Hunter:''' Darius, it's me!

'''Darius:''' What the- How did you get this number?

'''Hunter:''' Doesn't matter. I've found some incredible recruits at Hexside. I'm earning my place, just like you told me!

'''Darius:''' [''sighs exasperatedly''] Of course you are. I just wanted you to leave me alone.

'''Hunter:''' What was that?

'''Willow:''' Caleb! Waiting on you, buddy!

'''Hunter:''' I gotta go, but you'll meet them soon.

[''Hunter hangs up the phone and runs over to the team. Opposite them is another team led by Professor Hermonculus. Jerbo runs up to join that team.'']

'''Jerbo:''' Thanks for asking me to join, guys! I think we're gonna have a- [''gasps'']

'''Viney:''' [''shocked''] Jerbo? [''makes a cut throat gesture''] Traitor.

'''Jerbo:''' ...fun... afternoon. [''sheds a tear'']

[''Willow and her team ride on their staff and line up, getting ready to start.'']

'''Willow:''' All you got to do is fly high and snag some flags.

[''On the other side, Professor Hermonculus and his team is ready too.'']

'''Professor Hermonculus:''' Let's see what you can do, Captain.

[''Professor Hermonculus' abomination acts as the referee and blows the whistle. Professor Hermonculus shoots some abomination goo at Willow, but Viney blocks it with a shield. All players proceed to rush at each other. Hunter teleports himself close to the kid player on enemy team and snatches off her flag, then passes it on to Gus. Gus flies towards the pole and hangs the flag there, scoring one point.'']

'''Hunter:''' Gus, that was amazing!

[''Gus grins back at Hunter.'']

[''The game continues. Mary shoots some abomination goo at Gus, but he manages to evade it. The goo explodes and hits Skara instead, causing her to crash into a wall. The abomination referee blows the whistle. Enemy team hangs a flag on their pole, scoring one point.'']

[''The game continues. Viney rushes towards Jerbo and he rushes towards her. Both crash into each other and fall off their staffs. Willow and Gus rush towards the enemy team. Mary and the spike-headed student try to hit them with abomination goo but all missed.'']

'''Professor Hermonculus:''' [''frustrated''] She's right there! Can't you see?

[''Hunter teleports himself next to the professor.'']

'''Hunter:''' Boo.

[''Hunter grabs the professor's flag and flies off. Meanwhile, Willow summons some vines and aims it at the enemy team players. Mary gasps and covers her face. Willow successfully grabs 2 flags from the enemy players, but an abomination goo suddenly hits her staff from below, causing her to fall off. Hunter looks at this with a shocked expression. Scene cuts to Professor Hermonculus on the ground using a spell circle.'']

'''Professor Hermonculus:''' Oops. My hand slipped.

[''Players from both teams glance towards him angrily.'']

[''Willow manages to pass over the flags to Hunter as she continues falling to the ground. She summons a flower which successfully cushions her fall. Hunter looks down at Willow while remaining still. Gus gives him a hard push from behind.'']

'''Gus:''' Go, go, go!

[''Mary accidentally crashes into Gus, knocking him off his staff. Hunter flies to the team pole and hangs all 3 enemy flags on it, securing the victory. He lands, and Viney proceeds to pour a bucket of something red over his head. Everyone on Willow's team then start cheering.'']

[''Professor Hermonculus begrudgingly walks up to Willow.'']

'''Professor Hermonculus:''' May I please have your team name?

'''Willow:''' Shoot. We never thought of a name.

'''Hunter:''' The... [[Emerald Entrails]]!

[''The other team members looks at Hunter.'']

'''Hunter:''' You know, because... we're green, and there's... more to us... than you think. [''smiles awkwardly'']

[''Other team members remain silent. Then they all start chanting enthusiastically.'']

'''Viney, Skara, Willow and Gus:''' Entrails! Entrails! Entrails! Entrails!

'''Willow:''' Entrails team photo! We're number one!

[''Willow uses her scroll to take a group selfie. Everyone looks happy including Hunter, who is also smiling.'']

[''Scene cuts to a while later.'']

'''Hunter:''' I can't believe I almost bailed on you guys. Today was amazing! Thanks for giving me another shot.

'''Viney:''' Always nice making a new friend. I had an opening for one.

[''Viney glances towards Jerbo angrily. Jerbo gasps and clutches his chest.'']

'''Willow:''' We wouldn't have gotten here without you.

'''Gus:''' Yeah, I shouldn't have been so suspicious.

'''Hunter:''' We can forget all about that when we play next time... as a part of the Emperor's Coven!

[''All team members give Hunter a strange look.'']

'''Gus:''' The WHAT?!

'''Hunter:''' My name isn't Caleb. It's Hunter! And I'm the Emperor's right-hand man. The Golden Guard!

'''Willow:''' [''giggles nervously''] ...Y-Y-Y-You can't be serious? You're not the one Luz... told us about, right?

'''Hunter:''' Yes, I am!

[''Hunter nods at Flapjack. He flies upwards and transforms into a staff. Hunter grabs it and waves, transforming his outfit into the Golden Guard outfit. He then puts on his mask.'']

'''Hunter:''' Yeah, this would usually look cooler with the cloak, but... I don't have it at the moment. Long story.

[''The team members suddenly gasp. Multiple [[Coven Scout|Coven Scouts]] appear and surround them.'']

'''Hunter:''' Whoa there, scouts. I didn't give you orders to come here.

'''[[Steve]]:''' Darius sent us to collect your recruits.

'''Hunter:''' Ah, okay. Very good. Then there won't be any delay in branding you with coven sigils and taking you away from your friends and family forever. Hooray!

[''Gus, Willow and Viney look at the Coven Scouts angrily while Skara starts bawling.'']

[''Scene cuts to Police Precinct 128 in Bonesborough. The team members are locked up in a cell. Hunter takes away their staff and leans them on a wall outside the cell.'']

'''Hunter:''' Okay, listen, I'm sorry about this whole cell thing, but did you really have to punch Steve, Skara?

[''Steve is sitting on a stool, his helmet dented as he presses an ice pack onto the side of his head.'']

'''Steve:''' I get it. Emotions are running high. [''gives thumbs up''] Ice pack for Steve.

'''Hunter:''' Well, I don't get it. You're joining the best coven there is. You can keep all your magic, you get free room and board, you can even play Flyer Derby on your day off! Well, this year's day has already passed, but next year's only 52 weeks away!

'''Skara:''' We don't care! None of us want this!

'''Hunter:''' You will eventually. Trust me, I'm your friend now.

'''Gus:''' FRIENDS don't stab each other in the back.

'''Hunter:''' Sure they do. The Coven Heads do it all the time back at the castle. [''looks towards Willow''] Captain, you're on my side, right?

[''Willow has her back facing everyone. She is facing a wall with her head lowered.'']

'''Wilow:''' [''mutters''] I... thought I... could be good at this. 

[''Hunter's smile vanished.'']

'''Willow:''' But we're here because... I made a bad call. [''on the verge of crying''] I'm just... half-a-witch Willow.

[''An abomination goo suddenly appears, wraps the team members up and vanishes altogether. Scene cuts to them being teleported onto Darius' flying ship. Their palismen are sent up by a Coven Scout in a cage. Hunter flings the door open and runs outside.'']

'''Hunter:''' Darius, I did it! I found recruits!

'''Darius:''' [''grumpily''] Yeeeep, and you're making me work on my day off. Take this and quit bugging me.

[''Darius summons Hunter's cloak and fling it at him. Hunter looks down at his sigil and touches it.'']

'''Hunter:''' I can... wear this proudly now. [''looks up at Darius''] Right?

'''Darius:''' Can you?

[''Hunter looks at Darius uncertainly.'']

'''Darius:''' See you at the castle, Golden Guard.

[''Darius flies off in his ship. Steve comes out from the door behind Hunter.'']

'''Steve:''' I do not envy those kids, man.

'''Hunter:''' They just have to go through basic training before becoming scouts. It's not too bad.

'''Steve:''' Dude, do you even remember what we had to do? The duels. The mazes with the traps. That time we were left alone on a mountain?

'''Hunter:''' [''laughs''] Classic.

'''Steve:''' And of course Belos likes to collect everyone's palisman.

[''Steve's words reminded Hunter of something. A flashback scene from "[[Hunting Palismen]]" is shown, where Belos snatches a staff off Hunter's hand, breaks it, and absorbs the essence into his eyes and nostrils. Back to present where Hunter looks down nervously.'']

'''Steve:''' [''grunts, walks away''] Steve is beginning to regret his choices.

[''Hunter looks up at Darius' ship which is flying away.'']

'''Hunter:''' I think Hunter is too.

[''Scene cuts to the hooded figure running along a beach with Luz and Amity chasing after it. Luz tries to stop it with vines from [[Plant Glyph]], but it rolls over it and keeps on running. Amity summons an abomination and tries to block it, but it shoots fire with its hand and burns a hole in the abomination, then jumps through it and keeps on running.'']

'''Luz:''' Maybe it's [[Kikimora]]! And her only way to express herself is through fiction.

'''Amity:''' Maybe it's another shape-shifting [[Basilisk]] trying to write their story through metaphor!

[''The hooded figure comes to a dead end. It tries to climb up the wall, but the disguise falls off instead, revealing the figure to be [[Tiny Nose]].'']

'''Tiny Nose:''' Aw, wats.

[''Luz and Amity run up to her.'']

'''Amity:''' Tinella Nosa?

'''Luz:''' She's had a name this whole time?!

[''Cut to Tinella bringing Luz and Amity into a cave.'']

'''Tinella:''' Sorry, boss. The jig is up.

[''Luz sees something and gasps. Sitting atop some books on a rock, Tibbles puts down his book and stares down at the trio.'']

'''Luz:''' TIBBLES?!

[''Tibbles closes up his book and throws it aside. [[Mattholomule]] comes out carrying a pile of books.'']

'''Mattholomule:''' Edited a few more of those author photos, boss. [''sets the books down''] Some of my finest work. 

[''Mattholomule notices Luz and gasps.'']

'''Mattholomule:''' Luz?!

[''He takes the paint brush off his ear and blushes.'']

'''Luz:''' [''squints angrily''] Mattholomule!

'''Tibbles:''' Oh, calm down. Human garbage is constantly leaking into our water. And about a year ago I found this box of books washed up on the shore. [''jumps down from his throne''] I've been trying to make a [[snail]] off it ever since. [''angrily''] But no one's buying!!!

'''Mattholomule:''' Wait. I'm still getting paid for this, right?

'''Tibbles:''' Not now, kid. 

[''Tibbles shoos Mattholomule away.'']

'''Tibbles:''' According to the owner of the Book Nook, he's only ever had ONE customer purchase from this series.

[''Luz glances towards Amity. She blushes.'']

'''Amity:''' I-I didn't know. I swear!

'''Tibbles:''' This is the [''kicks a pile of books angrily''] WORST SCAM I've ever run.

'''Luz:''' [''disappointed''] So the author is human after all.

'''Tibbles:''' Oh-ho-ho. Were you expecting some dramatic discovery? [''chuckles'']

[''Amity summons an abomination fist and hits Tibbles from below, sending him flying upwards. Luz sighs and leans onto Amity's shoulder, while she wraps her arm around Luz's shoulder.'']

[''Scene cuts to Hunter chasing after Darius' flying ship. He teleports himself to get close to the ship faster. On the ship, Darius is scrolling on his scroll looking at Penstagram when he comes across [[Alador Blight|Alador's]] post.'']

'''Darius:''' Ugh. Mute.

[''An abomination is seen controlling the ship. The cage containing the palismen is put beside Darius. Skara tries to reach out to it, but Darius promptly slaps her away with abomination goo.'']

'''Darius:''' Nope.

[''Willow tries to bring the cage over using a Plant spell.'']

'''Darius:''' Nuh-uh.

[''Darius destroys the leaves with an abomination goo hand and slaps Willow's head with it.'']

'''Darius:''' [''sets aside his scroll''] You're gonna need to be a little more clever than that.

'''Hunter:''' DARIUS!

[''Hunter suddenly teleports himself next to Darius, starling him.'']

'''Willow:''' Now!

[''All team members jump off the ship. Darius and Hunter rush over and look down, only to see the team members disappear in a puff of smoke. Darius immediately glances back.'']

'''Darius:''' An illusion.

'''Willow:''' Land the ship!

[''The team members jump down from the ship frame's beam. Viney squashes the abomination and takes control of the ship.'']

'''Darius:''' WAIT!

[''Viney pulls down a lever and crashes the ship into the sea, destroying it. The team members then jump off the ship with their staffs and try to escape, but Darius blocks their path with an abomination.'']

'''Darius:''' Did you really think you could get away with endangering a Coven Head? Do you have any idea what I'm capable of?!

[''Darius transforms his right arm into a scythe. Willow tries to attack him with vines, but he slices them off easily. Willow then tries to form a shield with vines, but Darius slices it open easily too. He then raises his scythe arm, preparing to attack Willow. Willow braces herself for the attack while shielding other team members behind her. Hunter suddenly rushes forwards and puts himself between Darius and the team members.'']

'''Hunter:''' WAIT! 

'''Darius:''' [''sternly''] Out of my way, little prince.

'''Hunter:''' No! I was mistaken. These four are insolent agitators who aren't fit for the Emperor's Coven. [''looks down''] And I'm unfit to wear the sigil of the Golden Guard.

[''Hunter takes off his cloak and drops it to the ground. He then turns towards Willow.'']

'''Hunter:''' You can go.

[''Willow raises her staff. She is on the verge of tears.'']

'''Hunter:''' Please, captain.

[''Willow lowers her staff.'']

'''Willow:''' Let's move, team. We need to find a replacement. [''walks away''] After all, it'll be 52 weeks before Caleb's next day off.

[''The other team members walk away with Willow.'']

'''Darius:''' [''incredulously''] You... befriended them? And then you disobeyed me to protect them?! 

[''Darius raises his scythe arm. Expecting an attack, Hunter shuts his eyes and recoils in fear. Instead, Darius transforms his hand back and pats his head.'']

'''Darius:''' I'm impressed. I had you all wrong.

'''Hunter:''' Huh?

'''Darius:''' You're what? Sixteen? It's about time you made connections outside the castle. 

[''Darius summons a scroll and drops in into Hunter's hands. Hunter opens it up and sees the sign-up page of Penstagram.'']

'''Darius:''' I was just gonna drop them off at Hexside. We have more than enough recruits, in my opinion.

'''Hunter:''' Are you... gonna tell Belos about this?

'''Darius:''' [''smiles''] Are you going to tell him about your secret palisman?

[''Hunter gasps and reaches his hand towards Flapjack. Flapjack chirps.'']

'''Darius:''' Magic or not, I think you'll make your predecessors proud.

[''Darius throws Hunter's cloak back at him and fixes the sewing work using magic.'']

'''Darius:''' But you could still use a sewing lesson.

[''Scene cuts to Luz and Amity walking along a beach.'']

'''Amity:''' So, are you upset?

'''Luz:''' Nah. Azura's author may be a human, but I'm human too. Sometimes it's nice to be reminded that you don't need to be a powerful ancient witch to make something special.

'''Amity:''' Well, I had fun coming up with those theories. They were like... our own stories.

'''Luz:''' [''gasps, stops''] What if the Azura Book Club was also a writing club?

'''Amity:''' What would be our first writing prompt?

'''Luz:''' Hmm. How about the mystery of... [''gasps, points at the members of Emerald Entrails walking nearby''] What they were up to all night?

[''The members of the Emerald Entrails notice that Hunter had just created a Penstagram account.'']

'''Viney:''' Did he just make an account?

'''Willow:''' Wow. He is a slow typer.

'''Gus:''' He's worse than my dad.

[''Willow notices Luz and Amity nearby.'']

'''Willow:''' Oh. Hey, guys.

[''Luz and Amity come up to them.'']

'''Luz:''' I am REALLY digging those outfits. So, how was the rest of school? Did we... miss anything?

'''Willow:''' Just had our first team win as the Emerald Entrails.

[''All team members proceed to strike their respective cool poses.'']

'''Luz:''' Ooh! Let me see! Let me see!

[''Willow turns her scroll towards them and shows them the group selfie on her Penstagram account. Both Luz and Amity notice Hunter in the photo and gasp in shock. Scene cuts to a zoomed-out view of Bonesborough.'']

'''Luz and Amity:''' WHAT?!

[''The duo's yelling causes some birds to fly off.'']

[''The episode starts with an Abomaton plugging a tube in the portal, which transfers energy to it. [[Emperor Belos|Belos]] walks over and touches the broken portal key slinged aroung his neck. The [[Collector]] appears.'']

'''Collector:''' Heh, heh, heh, you nervous? You haven't been home in how many hundreds of years? What if it's all changed? What if you changed? You've gotten so used to eating Palismen you can barely keep your human shape anymore!

[''Belos's arm morphs into goo and strikes directly where the Collector is.'']

'''Collector:''' I can't wait to get out of this prison! There are so many games I want to play. If we need a third player, we can make another [[Golden Guard|Grimwalker]]!

'''Belos:''' No, not until I've dealt with this one.

'''Collector:''' [''impatient''] Just free me already! [''whining''] You promised!

'''Belos:''' The [[Draining Spell]] must work first, like you promised.

'''Collector:''' [''glares jokingly at Belos''] You need to have more faith in pinky swears.

'''Belos:''' Don't worry, Collector, your patience will be rewarded. [''he walks out and it is revealed they are at the Titan's head''] The [[Day of Unity]] is about to begin.

[''[[The Owl House Main Theme|Main theme]] plays, but with no music.'']

[''Scene cuts over to [[Blight Industries]].''] 

'''[[Odalia Blight|Odalia]]:''' I was devastated to hear of your demotion, [[Kikimora]].

'''[[Kikimora]]:''' Please stop talking to me.

'''Odalia:''' Personally, I liked you more than that turn cloak [[Golden Guard|Golden Guard.]] Ugh, if only there was a way to show Belos your true worth.

'''Kikimora:''' [''mockingly''] If only there was a way to show Belos- mmm, let's get out of here.

[''Kikimora's ship leaves Blight Industries. Scene then cuts to the Blight twins and Amity hiding near where the ship was.'']

'''[[Emira Blight|Emira]]:''' [''whispering''] She won't believe you!

'''[[Edric Blight|Edric]]:''' Even if she did, she won't care.

'''[[Amity Blight|Amity]]:''' Someone has to tell Mom about the Draining Spell or else she and dad are helping Belos hurt people. [''gasps'']

'''Odalia:''' I've got that little gremlin on the hook! She'll be the perfect test subject for our new products!

'''[[Alador Blight|Alador]]:''' Don't you think it's odd that they need this much security for the Day of Unity? Perhaps we should reconsider this deal.

'''Odalia:''' Blights always uphold their end of the deal, dear or should I reconsider ours? It might be time for the kids to play a more active role in Blight Industries. I could start the paperwork right now.

[''Alador and Odalia walk off.'']

'''Amity''': Hey, guys, Dad might listen! [''she finds the two have gone missing''] Guys?

[''Odalia's shadow suddenly looms in front of her and she turns around. The twins are held captive by an Abomaton and Odalia is looking angry.'']

'''Odalia:''' Hiding behind trash, Amity? To think my children are so painfully predictable in their deceit! You're. Grounded.

[''Scene transitions backs to [[Covens Against the Throne|CATS]] headquarters. [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] pulls out her little device and tries to decipher Amity's messages.'']

'''[[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]]:''' [''looking at Amity's message''] What kind of language is that?

'''[[Luz Noceda|Luz]]:''' The language of ''love'', Eda. But it's unfinished. It just says grounded, come quick, then nothing.

'''[[King]]:''' Special delivery! Ta-da! [''he shows Coven Scout disguises'']

'''[[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]]:''' Disguises, YES! A new milestone of malfeasance in my new life of crime.

'''[[Hooty]]:''' [''angrily''] This is just a trick to get me to wear clothes, well it won't work!

'''King:''' Anything else I can do? Grab some tea, defeat some baddies, create sentient life, I am a Titan-[Eda covers his mouth.]

'''Eda''': Totally frightened? [''chuckles and snorts''] Yeah, me too, pal. [''whispers to King''] I know you wanna help, but you gotta keep this stuff a secret between us five for now. You may be a Titan, but you're still a little guy.

[''Darius walks towards them.'']

'''[[Darius]]:''' Alright, let's get this briefing over with. [''everyone gathers at the table'']

'''[[Raine Whispers|Raine]]:''' Okay. We have twenty-four hours until the Day of Unity begins and Belos activates the Draining Spell.

'''Darius:''' And everyone in the Boiling Isles is taken out in one fell swoop.

'''Raine:''' Well, not ''everyone''. The spell targets those with Coven Sigils, using the nine types of magic as ingredients for the spell itself. It's channeled through each of the Coven Heads during the duration of the eclipse.

'''Lilith:''' So, what's the plan? Do we hide one of you?

'''Raine:''' We can't count on that, after my stunt with the BATs.

'''Darius:''' Belos made sure we all have replacements. We can't stop the draining spell, but we can corrupt it. That's where the Owl Lady comes in. [''gestures towards Eda'']

'''Eda:''' [''confused''] Huh?

'''Darius:''' [''groans in annoyance''] The curse, Eda. [''she flashes back to when she and Raine played their song'']

'''Eda:''' That's right! My curse warps magic. Huh, did quite a number on you two if I remember correctly. [''points and switches repeatedly between Darius and [[Eberwolf]]'']

'''Darius:''' You remember incorrectly! I was completely unfazed. 

[''Eberwolf suddenly pops out beside him, scaring him. He then draws a [[Spell Circle|spell circle]].'']

'''Darius:''' Eda would have to sneak into the tower, and here's how. [''he summons miniature abomination clones of two abominations, himself and Eberwolf''] I'll control a pair of abominations to release Eberwolf's flesh-eating beetles into the crowd. [''an abomination clone does so, and once the crowd sees it, they start to scream''] It will create a distraction so big, [''Clones of Eda, Darius and Eberwolf pass through the crowd''] we can get Eda up with the coven heads. The spell will halt once it comes in contact with the curse, and the day will be saved! No problem.

[''Goo then splatters everyone. Luz, Eda, King, Hooty and Lilith (she covers her eyes) are horrified and shocked, while the rest glare angrily at Darius, except Eberwolf.'']

'''Darius:''' What? Only a few people would get eaten. Even then, just the small ones.

'''Raine:''' [''wipes off the goo on their hair''] If we must do this, the safest bet is to have Eda tap into the spell, by taking someone's place as Coven Head. My place. Sigil, [''shows their coven sigil''] and all. 

[''Eda is shocked, so is Luz, Lilith and King.'']

'''Darius:''' As Head Bard, you'll also be flanked by me and Eber, where we can keep an eye on the others. 

'''Lilith:''' [''stands up''] Why are we acting like Edalyn's the only one with a curse here? Please, let me do this, as a--- [''she gets cut off by Eda'']

'''Eda:''' No. You haven't had your curse that long. You don't know how it would react. But I do. [''stands up proudly''] And how can I say no to sticking it to Belos one final time? Not only that, but I've got ''the'' Raine Whispers watching out for me. [''Raine smiles'']

'''[[Katya]]:''' Heck yes, Owl Lady! [''everyone stands up and cheers'']

[''Cut to outside the headquarters. Luz and King are on the balcony watching the ships float past them. Luz looks at Amity's meesage again then sadly looks off to the distance. King is about to comfort her when Eda interrupts them.'']

'''Eda:''' There you are. Look what I got! [''she hands Luz her newly-carved palisman, an egg''] The coat's finally dry. I thought you'd carve something cute, like a tarantula. Why an egg?

'''Luz:''' I got to decide what my future looked like when I chose to be a witch, and I want them to have that option too. Until then, I'm willing to wait.

'''Eda:''' [''pats Luz's head''] Try to play them music sometime. They can hear you.

'''Luz:''' [''holds up her palisman''] I love you already. [''kisses it'']

'''Eda:''' [''sighs''] Can you believe I gotta pretend to be a coven head?

'''Luz:''' Eda, are you sure you want to do this?

'''Eda:''' Well, of course I don't. You know, even before the curse I couldn't stand covens. Only a select few can learn about different types of magic. It made no sense. But.. if it's the only way to stop this, then I'm gonna do it.

[''She sees Luz looking sadly at Amity's message again and smiles.'']

'''Eda:''' But as exciting as saving the world sounds, it's not nearly as romantic as going on a rescue mission to save your girlfriend. 

'''Luz:''' [''becomes surprised''] I never said I was gonna--

'''Eda:''' [''teasing''] Ooh, but you wanna. It's written all over your face.

'''Luz:''' Of course, I want to, but I also want to be there for you.

'''Eda:''' Hey, us adults can handle ourselves. [''jokingly''] Tell bossy boots I said, "Yo."

'''King:''' [''grabs Eda's hair''] Stop talking like that. This isn't goodbye! I command it!

'''Eda:''' We'll see each other after the Day of Unity.

'''Luz:''' If we succeed...

'''Eda:''' ''When we'' succeed. We have the advantage, after all. We've got King the Titan [''holds up King, who stands up triumphantly''] and Luz the Human on our side. Legends in the making!

'''Luz:''' Don't forget Eda the Owl Lady.

'''King:''' Already a legend, and the most horrifying one of them all! 

[''Eda suddenly tickles his tummy and everyone laughs. They all hug.'']

'''Eda:''' So, you two protect each other, and we'll be back together before you know it. [''Raine arrives'']

'''Raine:''' Eda, let's get moving.

[''Eda and King walk inside as Raine holds the door open. Before Luz can step in, she suddenly grabs their sleeve and looks up at them with a grave expression on her face.'']

'''Luz:''' Promise you'll protect her.

'''Raine:''' [''smiles''] Promise. [''the two then walk inside''] Well, the next 24 hours are going to be rough. But everyone knows their part, and I'm confident we'll succeed. Because we are... the Covens Against the Throne...

'''Darius:''' [''quickly''] Wait, can we please not make this our battle cry?

'''Raine:''' AKA... the CATs! [''everyone hisses as Darius facepalms in annoyance'']

'''Darius:''' Oh, Titan, help us. [''everyone laughs'']

'''King:''' I'll... do my best.

[''Scene then cuts to the flying ships. Darius and Eberwolf are surrounded by Abomatons on their ship, and after seeing Raine and Eda on theirs, they nod. The latter two look towards the distance, determined. Meanwhile, somewhere in the forest, Luz, King and Katya are flying on the latter's palisman. They stop at a random section of the forest and Katya drops Luz and King off.'']

'''Luz:''' Why are we stopping?

'''Katya:''' [''pushes her and King off her palisman''] To meet your security escort. Darius insisted. See ya! [''flies off, chuckling'']

'''Luz:''' What? I don't need a security escort!

'''[[Willow Park|Willow]]:''' Did you hear that, Gus?

'''[[Gus Porter|Gus]]:''' Yeah, I know, I guess we'll just have to go home.

[''Luz turns around to find the two talking and sporting new outfits.'']

'''Gus:''' Well, it's been fun. [''Willow laughs''] See you around, Luz the Human.

'''Luz:''' [''chuckles and starts tearing up''] Wait. Wait, wait, wait! [''hugs the two''] Of course, I want you around! I'm so happy! ...And confused? I thought you were all hiding after what happened at Hexside.

'''[[Hunter]]:''' They were, [''Luz looks towards the side, surprised''] but then they heard Darius ordered me to protect you. [''walks towards the group'']

'''Gus:''' More like he begged us to come because he's terrified of getting recognized. [''Hunter glares at him'']

'''Luz:''' Hunter, are you really up for this? You must be dealing with a lot after learning---

'''Hunter:''' [''quickly''] That Belos is evil? [''laughs nervously''] Don't worry, I'm a-okay! [''he and Gus do their handshake, which leaves Luz confused'']

'''Luz:''' What the...

'''Willow:''' [''pats her shoulder''] This is what happens when you go missing for a week. [''walks towards them'']

[''Hunter sheepishly backs up and turns around with Luz.'']

'''Hunter:''' Don't you dare... mention that ''thing'' around them.

'''Luz:''' What thing? That you're a Grimwalker?

'''Hunter:''' Shh! [''puts up a finger to silence her''] Listen, I don't know if I'm a witch, or a human. All I know is that I'm a copy of someone Belos made, disappear.

'''Luz:''' [''looks back towards the others''] I don't know what you three went through, but they seem to like you.

'''Hunter:''' So I shouldn't worry how they'd react, right? If that's the case, have you told them about helping Philip?

[''Luz becomes mortified.'']

'''Hunter:''' Yeah, I overheard everything. Don't tell them. Please. [''Luz nods slowly'']

[''Cut to outside Blight Manor. The group arrives and immediately thinks of a plan to sneak in. Luz steps forward, but Gus stops her and uses his magic amplifier to scan any unseen illusions. Through the illusion, they see a Coven Scout spinning an illusion circle. The large circle disappears. Willow immediately steps forward and cracks her knuckles as Gus and Luz look at her and nod. Luz throws a plant glyph at the Coven Scout, which hits him and causing him to be restrained as the others run past him.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''while running''] Sorry, man!

[''The group reaches the front of the manor, but an Abomaton suddenly appears behind them. Luz attempts to run away but is restrained by the Abomaton.'']

'''King:''' Luz!

[''The Abomaton slowly advances on them and is about to sound its alarm when Hunter slices its head off with his staff. Willow then restrains its arms and legs with vines as the Abomaton gets dragged down somewhere. After, she helps Luz get up and the group finally reaches Amity's window, where she is pacing. Luz smiles and blushes at this. She then uses a plant glyph to raise her up and get her to the balcony, which is then covered in pretty flowers and vines.'']

'''Amity:''' [''from inside''] I can't believe Mom broke it!

[''Cut to inside of her room. Amity's cat-like device is now shown broken and she is desperately attempting to fix it with a screwdriver. Edric and Emira are sitting behind her on her bed, the former now lying down.'']

'''Amity:''' [''desperately''] I'm gonna fix it, and I'm gonna get a message out to Luz. I-I'm gonna do something!

'''Edric:''' We already tried burning down the factory! That's what got us grounded too.

[''Amity walks over towards the twins.'']

'''Amity:''' If only Mom would just, hear us out!

'''Emira:''' We can shout as loud as we want, but money ''always'' shouts louder.

'''Amity:''' Dad would listen. I know he would. [''voice breaking''] The world is ending, no one'll listen to us... and I just-- [''sobs''] I just wanna know that Luz is safe! [''starts crying'']

'''Emira:''' What do you think Luz would say to you right now?

'''Amity:''' Probably something dorky, but also sweet. [''wipes away her tears''] Like how I shouldn't give up and that anything is possible. Or she'd say that I might be scared now but to not let that stop me, because-- because every problem has a solution. [''Emira notices something by the window and points out to Edric; the twins smile and leave''] And everything's been so crazy, we've barely been able to spend time together. And I am not letting the world end before we go on a ''real'' date!

'''Luz:''' Whoa, you're right! [''Amity gasps and looks at her window, and she sees Luz''] I would say all that.

'''Amity:''' [''tears up, runs towards Luz''] Luz!

'''Luz:''' [''runs towards Amity''] Sweet potato!

[''The two hug each other and laugh.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm gonna take you out when this is all over, Amity, I promise. No monsters, no mysteries, no deadly duels, it's going to be the most mundane, slice-of-life date ever. And it'll be awesome.

'''Amity:''' I know!

[''Much to Luz's surprise, Amity kisses her on the lips. Afterwards, the two are completely flustered.'']

'''Luz:''' [''flustered: in an Austrailian accent''] Oh. Crikey.

'''Amity:''' I can't believe I just did that.

'''Luz:''' I can't believe I just said that! Oh, crikey. How did I even think that? Come on, Luz, be cool next time.

'''Amity:''' Luz, I don't think my parents know what they're helping Belos accomplish. Will you help me tell them about the draining spell?

'''Luz:''' Of course. That's why we're here!

'''Amity:''' [''confused''] We?

[''The two look over the balcony to find King, Willow, Gus and Hunter. They look at each other and smile.'']

[''Open in the middle of a mystical forest, during a boiling rainstorm. A small, furry creature peeks out from a log when, then hides back in when a hooded stranger runs past. This stranger runs into a ruined building to seek shelter from the boiling rain and pull their hood down, revealing themself to be a younger [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]], with shorter ginger hair. She looks at her cape, annoyed that the rain had burnt holes in it. As she starts to walk further in, unbeknownst to her, a pair of glowing yellow eyes appear from a crevice within a pile of fallen rocks.'']

[''Eda wanders further into the ruins, past a cluster of stacked rock formations, when a shadowy figure runs past in the foreground, startling Eda.'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''brandishing her staff''] Who's there? Reveal yourself!

[''Cut to a perspective view from this mysterious figure, approaching Eda from behind. Eda turns around and gasps.'']

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-''' 

[''In the present, Luz is at the Owl House. She is studying and experimenting with glyphs in a notebook.'']

'''Luz:''' Hmmm...

[''She starts drawing a glyph, but scribbles it out. She makes a frustrated grunt. King dives through, tumbling books over.'']

'''King:''' Luz, I need your help! I think Francois is trying to start a rebellion.

[''Pan to the couch, covered in King's plushies. Francois, his pale pink bunny, is sitting in the center on a pillow. After a beat, a jagged dagger with a red gem on the hilt falls out from behind him.'']

'''Luz:''' In a minute, King. I'm getting so close to figuring out this glyph combo.

'''King:''' It's always glyphs and portals with you these days. What about King?

'''Luz:''' Why don't you ask Lilith for help? She was in the Emperor's Coven. She has more experience with unruly mobs than anyone.

[''Lilith is kneeling at the desk, extremely focused on drawing a glyph with a red paintbrush. She's bent over, eyes only a short distance from the paper. Her hair is messy and the whites of her eyes are huge, with tiny irises.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''giggling giddily''] Watching the ink dry is the best part.

[''King grunts in disapproval.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''giving Lilith a mug''] A fresh cup of tea for ''my'' favorite cup of tea. That's you, Lulu.

[''Lilith smooths her hair, and her eyes are back to normal.'']

'''Lilith:''' Well, Hootsifer, you truly are a gem. [''pets his head''] How do you always know what to do?

'''King:''' [''whispering to Luz''] What's going on? Is Hooty blackmailing her?

'''Luz:''' Oh, I think they're actually friends. Isn't that nice? [''closes her book and stands up, holding a glyph''] Okay, this will work for sure. Now you see me...

[''Luz slams the glyph to her chest and vanishes. King gasps. Lilith looks up. Luz reappears.'']

'''Luz:''' ...now you don't. Oh, I guess it only lasts as long as I hold my breath. Still pretty cool, huh?

[''King rushes and clings to Luz's leg.'']

'''King:''' Don't ever do that again!

[''Lilith stands up in amazement.'']

'''Lilith:''' Do that again! How ever did you accomplish it?

'''Luz:''' [''shaking King off her leg''] Well, since you guys discovered that we can make new spells by combining glyphs, I've been experimenting. I got the invisibility idea from your history books, Lilith.

[''Lilith stands up and begins walking to the side.'']

'''Lilith:''' Fascinating! As the lead historical scholar of the Emperor's Coven, my aid could be very helpful in--

[''Lilith stumbles over the tower of King's plushies, toppling them.'']

'''King:''' An ambush! Men, defend your ruler!

[''King tosses a nearby plush at Lilith. Hooty blocks it, and dramatically falls into Lilith's arms.'']

'''Hooty:''' I'm done for, Lulu.

'''Lilith:''' Hootsifer, this is make-believe.

'''Hooty:''' Ah, to die in your arms. Avenge me.

[''Hooty droops and sticks his tongue out, his eyes becoming Xs (i.e. he plays dead). King tosses another plushie at Lilith's head.'']

'''King:''' The King of Demons yields to no one!

'''Lilith:''' Historically, demons have never been united under a single rule until Belos. There's no such thing as a "King of Demons".

[''King throws yet another plush at Lilith's head.'']

'''King:''' Blasphemy! Clearly, you know nothing of my reign of terror. Allow me to tell you.

[''Cut to a series of medieval-style illustrations depicting King as a large, fearsome King of Demons.'']

'''King:''' [''voiceover''] I was once the mighty King of Demons. I was beloved almost as much as I was feared. But one dark day, an evil spell was cast...

[''In one illustration, a giant green hand takes a large crown from King's head. Transition back to King, who falls to his knees.'']

'''King:''' ...transforming me into ''this!''

'''Hooty:''' Oh? What happened to your "[[A Lying Witch and a Warden|crown of power]]"?

'''King:''' A trifle! That was just to test Eda and Luz's dedication to me! They passed. My ''real'' crown is still out there. But when I shrank, my memories got, uh... fuzzy.

'''Lilith:''' How convenient. A hole in your memory for each hole in your story.

'''Hooty:''' Nice one, Lulu! Up top!

[''Lilith "high-fives" Hooty's face, giving him a black eye.'']

'''King:''' Hey, I remember plenty!

[''Back to the illustrations of a monstrous King, which depict what he describes.'']

'''King:''' [''voiceover''] I remember armies bowing before me, being served the greatest of feasts...

[''Cut to a POV shot of King's paw reaching for a bright light as it shrinks from view.'']

'''King:''' ...and falling from a massive height as evil hex shrank me. One day, I'll return to my rightful place...

[''Cut to a dramatic shot of King finishing his soliloquy.'']

'''King:''' ''...and all shall fear me!''

[''Luz grabs King and gives him a belly rub.'']

'''Luz:''' [''like talking to a puppy''] Aw, you're gonna be such a good tyrant! Who's the scariest demon king? Who is it?

'''King:''' [''laughing''] Me! It's me!

'''Lilith:''' Your dedication to this farce would be charming if it wasn't so sad.

'''King:''' Don't blame me for your ignorance. I'm not a liar, and I can prove it.

[''King storms off into a corridor.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''offended gasp''] He called me ignorant. ''Me!'' [''Hooty shakes his head in disapproval'']

'''Luz:''' Stop it, you guys. This story is really important to him, so the least we can do is play along.

'''Lilith:''' You mean indulge his silly fantasy?

'''Hooty:''' Yeah! I'm a house of principles! You're asking me to lie? ''Hoot''rageous!

'''Luz:''' Could you please just go with it? For his sake?

[''At the doorway, King is struggling to get back through with two long poles in his arms. They fall, and he holds them vertically and walks through. They're Eda and Lilith's staffs.'']

'''King:''' All right, you two shall regret ever doubting me. We're going to ''my'' castle!

'''Luz:''' Uh...

'''Hooty:''' What's wrong, Luz? I thought you said we should just ''"go with"''--

'''Luz:''' Go with him! I said we should go with him, right? How could I forget what I just said?

[''Luz grabs Eda's staff off King, and Lilith takes her's.'']

'''Lilith:''' My historical expertise is being questioned, and I will not allow it. Hooty, would you like to accompany us?

'''Hooty:''' [''gasps''] I-I'll get ready!

[''Hooty stretches backwards toward the door. Cutting back to Luz, King, and Lilith, they hear sounds of crashing and squishing organs and splattering. The three all look disgusted and very disturbed until they gasp in horror. Cut to reveal that the part of the door where Hooty would be is now hollow, with pulsing organs at the edges. Below it, Hooty is now sitting in a birdhouse-shaped backpack.'']

'''Hooty:''' Porta-Hooty, reporting for Hooty!

[''Luz dry-retches. King is tearing up while slowly shaking his head. Lilith's hand is at her chest and she's taken aback. When Luz looks back at Hooty, she gags and dry-retches again.'']

[''Meanwhile, Eda gets out of a steamy bathroom wearing a bathrobe and a towel on her head while Luz, Lilith, King, and Hooty fly away on their staffs. She walks into the main room.'']

'''Eda:''' Hmm? Where'd everyone go? Man, they made a mess in here. Oh well. It's been a while since I had room to put my feet up.

[''Eda jumps on the couch and detaches her feet. Her head is on the armrest and she opens her eyes to see a note on King's plushies, reading...'']

'''King:''' [''voiceover''] Off to my real castle! Don't wait up! Love, your favorite demon overlord.

'''Eda:''' Oh, no! Not again! Oh! [''She gets off the couch. Since her feet are detached, she simply falls.'']

[''A dressed Eda gets out of the door, putting her feet back on, and heads into the shed. She emerges in her bathtub motorboat, flying it off a ledge and into the sea.'']

[''Cut to Luz (wearing her cape) and King flying over the sea on Eda's staff, while Lilith rides her's while wearing the Porta-Hooty on her back.'']

'''Hooty:''' Are we ''still'' flying? It's been hours.

'''Lilith:''' Should we call it a day? Or perhaps a night? [''laughing''] Hooty, your sense of humor is infectious.

'''King:''' There it is!

[''He points at an island slowly becoming clear in the fog. He steers Luz down towards it, and Lilith follows.'']

'''Lilith:''' This island shouldn't be here. It's not on any of the maps.

'''King:''' It's always been there when ''I'' looked for it.

[''They land on the shore and walk into the jungle.'']

'''King:''' After I shrunk, I woke up here, in Eda's arms, and she carried me away. Like a ''wittle'' baby.

'''Luz:''' Awww...

[''Luz grumpily gestures at Lilith and Hooty to follow.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''growls''] Fine. Aw.

'''Hooty:''' [''gasps''] Look!

[''The fog clears to reveal a dilapidated tower.'']

'''King:''' Ah, home sweet home.

[''Cut to black.'']

[''Our heroes are trekking through the jungle, with King leading the way. King climbs over a tree root, with Luz and Lilith behind him.'']

'''Lilith:''' That tower is certainly intriguing, but-- Oh!

[''She trips over the root. Hooty extends himself to a nearby tree trunk to stabilize her.'']

'''Lilith:''' Thank you, Hootsifer.

'''Hooty:''' [''muffled''] My pleasure.

'''Lilith:''' But couldn't we have landed a little closer?

'''King:''' The treetops are so thick, this is the ''only'' way in. Plus, now I can dramatically do..

[''King grabs a bush obscuring the path. He pulls it aside, revealing a keyhole-shaped entrance to the tower.'']

'''King:''' ''...this!''

'''Luz:''' Ooh. A door fit for a tyrant.

'''King:''' [''chuckles''] That's me!

[''They walk toward the entrance, which is blocked by rocks. King climbs them.'']

'''King:''' I'll find you guys another way in. Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!

[''King crawls into a crevice in the rock pile. Lilith walks over to a wall with a strange symbol caved into it.'']

'''Lilith:''' Huh. What a strange material. And this symbol. I've never seen anything quite like this.

'''Hooty:''' Ha! I've seen better graffiti. I've got better graffiti on me.

[''Hooty raises his side, showing "LUZ!" and three cool S's graffitied on him.'']

'''Lilith:''' Luz, look! This predates any language I know. King's story may be a fake, but these ruins are a history mystery. [''giggles and claps excitedly'']

[''The rocks collapse, clearing the way. King peeks up.'']

'''King:''' Eh? What's a mystery?

'''Luz:''' [''laughing''] The only mystery is how Lilith can be so smart and so wrong at the same time. Academics, am I right?

'''King:''' You so are. Come on in.

[''Lilith give Luz a dirty look, and she sheepishly smiles back. The two climb over the rocks and into the tower. They use light glyphs to make their own lights and examine the room, which is littered with rocks stacked to make the same figure of something with two or three round rocks as a body and a crescent-shaped head placed horizontally.'']

'''King:''' Ah, the chamber where I would devour the hearts of my foes. The taste was cold and bitter, but I bet yours would be sweet, Luz.

'''Luz:''' With all the sugar I eat, it better be.

[''They all go forward. Luz notices a shadow resembling the rock figures passing behind her. She gasps, stops, and turns her light around. There's nobody there.'']

'''King:''' Can't believe your eyes, huh? My castle does have that effect.

'''Luz:''' Yeah. [''sheepish laugh''] So much wonder.

[''Lilith walks through a hallway. Hooty gasps and looks at a wall.'']

'''Hooty:''' Are you seein' what I'm seein'?

[''Lilith walks over to a wall, on which is a carving of a giant demon resembling King.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''gasps''] These carvings, they're ancient.

'''Hooty:''' Wh-what does that mean?

'''Lilith:''' Well, if I've never heard about this ruin, let alone this entire island, who knows what other parts of history we scholars have missed?

'''Hooty:''' Are you saying...

'''Lilith:''' That he may actually have been...

'''Lilith and Hooty:''' [''shocked''] The ''King of Demons?!''

[''Meanwhile, King is standing at the top of a pile of rocks, showing off to Luz.'']

'''King:''' Ah, my kingdom. I, uh... [''wipes a tear from his eye''] I got some bone dust in my eye.

'''Luz:''' [''looking up''] What was up there?

[''King also looks up. There's a hole in the ceiling with rocks plugging it.'']

'''King:''' I-I can't quite recall. I just remember a muffled roar, probably some minion praising my name.

'''Luz:''' Well, uh... wanna head back? This is all so cool, but Eda's probably on her third cup of apple blood by now, and the last time, it was real hard getting her off the roof.

[''Hooty knocks Luz to the ground.'']

'''Hooty:''' Your Majesty! It's me, faithful ol' Hooty. You know I was messin' around with you the whole time, right?

'''Luz:''' [''getting up''] "Your Majesty"?

[''Lilith pushes Luz aside again onto the ground''.]

'''Lilith:''' It's clear these ruins are of immense historical value. Perhaps you could tell me more about them.

[''Luz gets up and brushes herself off.'']

'''King:''' [''laughing''] I suppose I could, uh, regale you with some tales.

[''Luz hears something hissing in a dark corridor.'']

'''King:''' Am I using that word right? Regale?

[''Luz shines her light down the corridor and gasps.'']

'''Luz:''' Uh, guys, are you hearing this?

'''King:''' I'll show you where my throne used to be. It was made from the teeth of my enemies and... [''laughing''] Boy, was it awkward to sit in.

[''King leads Lilith and Hooty down another direction. Luz goes down the hallway by herself, and sees that the walls are lined with recesses containing stone figures, resembling the little ones in the foyer, partially covered in fleshy goop.'']

'''Luz:''' What ''are'' these things?

[''She stops by one figure with its "hand" sticking out. She groans in disgust and passes by.'']

'''Luz:''' Just kidding. I'd never leave someone hanging. Up top, buddy.

[''She high-fives it. It falls apart on her. On the ground, Luz looks up and sees countless other figures in recesses towards the ceiling. She shines her light and sees that one of them is empty. Suddenly, she hears hissing noise behind her. She turns and notices a figure running away. Luz chases after it.'']

[''Cut back to King, Lilith and Hooty.'']

'''King:''' And that's how I would annihilate my enemies. Who needs due process, am I right?

'''Lilith:''' [''gestured toward a wall carving''] What does this image represent, my lord?

'''King:''' Uh, it's hard to remember. But that handsome devil looks familiar, huh?

[''Luz approaches them.'']

'''Luz:''' Tour's over! We gotta go! ''Now!''

'''Lilith:''' But there's so much to learn.

'''Luz:''' This environment is not conducive to learning. It's conducive to ''death!''

'''King:''' Ah, you saw the horrifying monstrosity room. Don't worry, they can't hurt you.

[''The hissing is heard again. Everyone looks up and sees a fleshy rock monster, alive, crawling along the ceiling. It rotates its head down to look at them.'']

'''Luz:''' ''That'' one can. Let's go!

[''Luz grabs King and runs for the entrance, but the monster jumps in front of her and blocks her way. It changes its right arm into a claw and swipes at her. Lilith attacks it with ice magic, pinning it to a pile of rocks. All three start running.'']

'''Luz:''' Dang, girl, you've been practicing!

'''Lilith:''' You may admire my progress when we get out of here alive!

[''The monster slides through the ice spikes and gives chase, running along the walls and ceiling before again pouncing in front of Luz and Lilith. It stands tall, turns its head and changes its left arm into an axe. It prepares to strike, but an explosion at the head puts it on the ground. Eda jumps in from the rocks, wearing belts armed with explosive potions.'']

'''Eda:''' Get out of here! [''grabs a potion''] I'll hold it back and meet you outside.

[''She tosses a potion at the monster.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda! We can fight it together!

'''Eda:''' You can't beat this thing. Go!

[''Luz and Lilith look at each other, and they make haste for the exit. Eda grabs another potion from her belt and tosses it in her hand.'']

'''Eda:''' It's been a while. Miss me?

[''The monster leaps at Eda, turning the screen black.'']

[''Luz and Lilith run out, but stop and turn toward the entrance.'']

'''Hooty:''' More running, less stopping!

'''Lilith:''' Edalyn said to wait here!

'''Luz:''' We can't let her fight it alone! We have to go back!

[''Everyone hears explosions from within. They all look at the door with frightful anticipation, a terrified King clutching Luz. Just then, Eda walks out, clutching a wound on her shoulder.'']

'''Lilith:''' Edalyn!

[''She runs up to Eda and holds her up.'']

'''Lilith:''' You're hurt. What of that horrible creature?

[''It climbs up and hisses, brandishing an axe-arm. It swings down on Eda and Lilith, but gets a blue forcefield appears the tower and the outside. The axe-arm goes limp on the outside, and the monster pulls it back inside.'']

'''Eda:''' It can't get past the entrance. We're safe now.

'''Luz:''' That thing must be guarding this place against intruders.

'''King:''' But it's ''my'' castle. How could ''we'' be intruders?

'''Luz:''' Uh... u-um...

'''King:''' [''starts wising up''] You don't believe this is my castle.

[''Luz looks the other way as sweat runs down her face.'']

'''King:''' Luz, ''you'' think ''I'' would lie to you?

'''Luz:''' King, I...

'''Eda:''' You aren't lying. You just don't know the truth.

[''Eda groans and falls to her knees. Lilith starts bandaging her arm.'']

'''Eda:''' It's time for me to tell you how we really met.

[''A flashback begins, taking place on the island eight years ago. Boiling rain is falling; a younger Eda flies down on her staff and sets foot on the shore.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] Eight years ago I was looking for a place to hide from the Emperors Coven. I never knew this place existed and it just... ''appeared'' out of the mist. So, I landed.

[''Young Eda looks at the holes the burning rain is making on her cloak, then notices the ruined tower in the distance.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] Now, I was one hot tamale, but the boiling rains were even hotter. I needed shelter.

[''Cut to Young Eda entering the ruins, just like in the cold open.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] But when I found it... I wasnt alone.

[''She notices that shadowy figure running past her. She readies her staff.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Whos there? Reveal yourself!

[''She turns around and gasps as she see what was trailing her. From behind a small rock formation, a small, furry creature with a skull mask on its head jumps out and wags its tail. It's King as a baby. The baby King tilts his head, and Eda lowers her staff. King then picks up a crescent-shaped rock and puts it on top of an incomplete figure.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Did you make all these? What ''are'' you?

[''She starts petting King, who happily wags his tail.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] I assumed you were just some stray dog. But then...

[''The two look up and see the monster towering over them, brandishing its axe-hand. Young Eda grabs King and bolts, barely avoiding the axe swing.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] ...that thing was gonna kill us both, so I picked you up and bounced.

[''Young Eda and King are fly out of the ruins. Approaching its magical boundary, the monster fashions its limbs into a bow-and-arrow and fires at them. The stone arrow hits King, breaking off his left horn and rendering him unconscious. Young Eda, having fallen off her staff, continues her escape on foot, grabbing King and his broken horn.'']

[''Cut to Eda looking sympathetically at the baby King as they fly away from the island.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] Against my better judgment, I took you home with me.

[''Cut to a little later at the Owl House. Young Eda looks on as Baby King stacking piles of household objects, similar to the rocks in his castle.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] Id gotten you the collar, cause... well, thats what you do when you get a new pet. But then...

[''Young Eda looks on as Baby King stacks household objects upon one another, similar to the rocks in his castle. He completes one stack and stands proudly.'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''leans back on the door frame and snorts''] Ah, look at you. A king amongst his subjects.

'''Baby King:''' King... King! [''he falls down and yelps'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''surprised''] It spoke. [''to King''] Yeah, thats right. A king. [''walks over and kneels down''] You know what else kings do? They command armies and eat delicious feasts.

[''Baby King claps and makes happy noises. Young Eda continues gesturing kingly yarns to Baby King as he looks up with big, attentive eyes.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voiceover''] And thats how you got the idea you were some despotic overlord.

[''Fade back to present, with Eda finishing her story.'']

'''Eda:''' Oh, but you were finally happy. So I kept playing along with it.

'''King:''' [''in disbelief''] Y-Youre lying!

'''Eda:''' Im not.

[''Eda takes something out of her hair, revealing it to be the broken piece of King's horn. King is shocked and curious about this, and he slowly takes it from Eda's hand. He gasps, and the camera zooms into his eye, revealing forgotten moments of his life flashing before him.'']

[''Transition to a flashback of baby King in the temple, standing on a pile of rocks and presenting himself to his army of little rock figures.'']

'''King:''' [''voiceover''] My army?

[''Transition to another flashback, showing baby King grabbing a small insect and eating it.'']

'''King:''' My feasts..

[''Transition back to the present, with King still holding the peace of horn, looking devastated.'']

'''King:''' ''My life...''

[''He looks down at the piece of horn, panics and throws it down.'']

'''King:''' AAH! No! Keep that thing away from me! It's messing with my head!

[''Luz extends her hand in sympathy.'']

'''Luz:''' King, it's gonna be okay.

'''King:''' [''despondent; panicking''] Y-You're all just making fun of me, like usual, right? [''hyperventilates''] No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[''King, now on the verge of tears, holds onto his head and breathes heavily before running away from the group.'']

'''King:''' [''sobbing''] No!

[''Luz gets up and forlornly extends her hand as she watches King disappear into the jungle.'']

'''Luz:''' KING!

[''Cut to black. Resumes on Luz, Eda and Lilith walking through the jungle in search of the runaway King. Luz is trying to call for him.'']

'''Luz:''' King?! Kiiiiing! Please, come back!

'''Lilith:''' I can't fly. The tree cover is too dense. I regret ever playing a part in this.

[''Hooty, after looking sympathetic for a while, starts bawling.'']

'''Hooty:''' Is this what regret feels like? I HATE IT!

[''Hooty droops over Lilith's shoulder and continues crying. She gently pats him.'']

'''Luz:''' I lied to him, even though I knew he trusted me. Now, he's all alone.  

[''Luz sits down and silently weeps.'']

'''Eda:''' For now, let's split up. This island is small, and he's even smaller. He can't have gone far.

[''Lilith and Hooty leave toward the right, while Eda kneels down to comfort a teary-eyed Luz.'']

'''Eda:''' [''assuredly''] Don't worry. We'll find him.

[''Eda leaves toward the left. Luz wipes her eyes, gets up and, with a determined look on her face, leaves to look for King.'']

'''Luz:''' Kiiiiing? ''Kiiiiing?!''

[''Luz reaches the edge of the jungle and pauses. There, on the beach in front of her, is King, sitting alone on a log, staring out at the sea. A sympathetic Luz walks up to him and joins him on the log.'']

'''King:''' [''still upset''] Eda was right, wasn't she? I was never king of anything. I'm nobody.

'''Luz:''' You ''are'' somebody. And I love that somebody very much. I'm sorry I lied about what I believed.

'''King:''' ''Everyone'' lied! And I was too caught up in the fantasy to realize it! [''starts sobbing''] I... I don't know what to do, Luz! [''sniffles''] I can't tell what's real and what's fake!

[''King buries his face in his paws. Luz looks like she's about to start crying herself, but then looks up toward the ruined temple in the distance.'']

'''Luz:''' Something's not adding up. One of your memories is falling, right? 

'''King:''' [''wiping his eyes''] Probably another stupid thing I made up! [''At this point, King is acting doubtful.'']

'''Luz:''' No! What if that's a ''real'' memory?

'''King:''' Why does it matter?

'''Luz:''' You said you remember a roar from up in that shaft. Maybe ''that's'' where you fell from! Eda found you in those ruins. There's gotta be a clue in there about where you came from!

'''King:''' I don't know, Luz. What if the story gets worse?

'''Luz:''' You might have been alone before, but you have us now. Whatever we find up there won't change that. So, what do you say?

[''Luz extends her hand. After a while, King gets up puts his paw in it.'']

'''King:''' Okay.

[''In the jungle, Luz leads King back to Eda and Lilith, both looking worried.'']

'''Eda:''' [''happily''] King! You're alright!

[''She runs toward King, but then stops upon noticing him looking sternly up at her.'']

'''Eda:''' [''sigh''] You're mad at me. I get it. I would be, too. [''kneels down''] I'm so sorry, King.

[''King suddenly pokes her on the cheek.'']

'''King:''' Boop. No more secrets, okay? You have to promise me.

'''Eda:''' Only truths. I promise.

'''Luz:''' Great. Now, before we leave, we have one more thing to check out. [''She points toward the tower in the distance.'']

[''Inside the castle, the monster is maintaining one of the little rock statues when it suddenly reacts to something unseen. It hisses and looks back. It sees an exploding position being tossed and gets hit. Lilith flies in on her staff, aiming Hooty like a bazooka.'']

'''Hooty:''' Special delivery... [''deep voice''] '''''PAIN!'''''

[''Hooty fires a potion out of his mouth, and it hits the monster again. Suddenly, something invisible flies low past it. Luz takes a deep breath in, and she, King and Eda reappear on her staff, just like the glyph spell the showed off earlier.'']

'''Eda:''' You sure they'll be alright?

[''Eda stops, and Luz hops off the staff.'']

'''Luz:''' Hooty knows what to do.

[''Hooty is coughing up potions in a rapid-fire fashion, while Lilith is holding his head and looking disgusted.'']

'''Eda:''' [''to herself''] Are you ''sure'' they'll be alright? 

[''While Lilith and Hooty are battling the monster, Eda flies up to the blocked hole in the ceiling. She sticks a potion into the rocks and jumps down toward Luz and King.'']

'''Eda:''' Ready?

'''Luz:''' I always wanted to do something like this!

[''Luz readies a glyph as Lilith and Hooty continue holding the monster off.'']

'''Hooty:''' They're in place!

'''Lilith:''' Hold your breath!

[''Lilith activates an invisibility glyph and they inhale, turning themselves invisible. The monster hisses and looks around confused before getting hit by the invisible Lilith. As Luz aims the glyph at the overhead potion, the monster grabs Lilith by the head, turning her visible again. Just then, Luz changes the paper into a fireball and flings it toward the potion. It hits, blowing the hole in the ceiling open.'' ''Hooty hits the monster with his face, freeing Lilith. She grabs her staff, and starts following Eda, Luz and King up the open hole.'']

'''Luz:''' FLY, FLY, FLY!

[''They start going up the hole, with Lilith producing a glyph to light the dark tunnel. The monster gives chase. Our heroes soon reach the end of the tunnel.'']

'''Luz:''' There's...

'''King:''' There's...

[''Zoom out to reveal that the tunnel has lead to a small, empty room covered in cobwebs.'']

'''Eda:''' ''Nothing'' here!

[''Everyone gets off the staffs and starts exploring. King hears hissing, looks down the hole and sees the monster coming in fast.'']

'''King:''' [''panicked''] IT'S COMING!

[''King shrieks and scats as the monster swipes its arm. It has the four cornered against a locked door. King backs into it, and his touch triggers a medical reaction.'']

'''King:''' Huh?

[''The door opens, causing everyone to fall backwards into a secret room. They hurriedly close the door as the monster reaches toward them, causing its goopy hand to get cut off. Everyone takes deep sighs of relief.'']

'''Eda:''' Huh, I think we're safe... for now. But how did we get the door open?

'''King:''' Huh? [''looks at his paw'']

'''Lilith:''' [''dumbstruck''] This room is old. ''Very'' old.

[''They begin exploring the room, which is decorated with decaying plants and a skylight on the ceiling. In the middle of the room is a golden pedestal. King walks up to it and sees the remains of a broken eggshell at the top.'']

'''Luz:''' I ''knew'' there was something up here! I'm like the mystery whisperer. The butler did it, magnifying glass, secret door.

'''Lilith:''' It looks like that creature was made to guard whatever was in here.

'''Luz:''' King, does any of this feel familiar to you?

'''King:''' I'm not sure, but I think I know how to jog my memory. Eda, I'm ready. [''extends his paw'']

'''Eda:''' [''worried''] Are you sure?

'''King:''' I am.

[''Eda take the broken piece of horn out of her hair and gives it to King, who places it on his stump. He gasps as his memories return to him, and the camera zooms into his eye. Cut to black.'']

'''King:''' [''voiceover''] I remember a deep roar.

[''Fade in on a flashback, showing an unborn King growing inside his egg. A demonic roar is heard from outside the shell.'']

'''King:''' And then, something happened...

[''The camera shakes to what sounds like an explosion. The unborn King reacts to the sound.'']

'''King:''' ...but I was too small to do anything. So, I went back to sleep.

[''Fade to black. Fade in again, this time to a more developed King inside the egg.'']

'''King:''' And the next time I woke up...

[''The eggshell starts to crack, and a slit of light shines through. King reacts to the light and reaches for it. Cut to the secret room, where King emerges from his egg and tumbles down the steps of the pedestal. The newborn King opens his eyes for the first time and sees the castle's mysterious symbol on the skylight.'' ''King'' ''then'' ''pulls himself across the room until he reaches the door. It magically reacts to his touch and opens, revealing the monster behind it. The two look at each other. The monster picks up King, cradles him and walks to the shaft. It dives down the hole with King in its arms, and King reaches for the light from the top as it disappears from view. Fade to black.'']

[''Cut back to the present. King takes the broken horn off his stump, a look of revelation on his face.'']

'''Luz:''' King...

'''King:''' That roar. It meant "son". I don't know how I know that, but I do. Someone called me their son. Luz, I think it was my dad!

'''Luz:''' Maybe that was ''him'' on all those wall carvings.

[''The monster breaks through the door down and prepares to strike with his axe-hand. As Luz cowers in fear, King defiantly runs up to it and raises his paw.'']

'''King:''' Stop.

[''The monster suddenly pauses, and it bows to him in respect.'']

'''Eda:''' That thing was defending King from us this whole time? Huh. Alright.

[''Lilith takes a picture of the wall carvings with an instant flash camera; the others look at her.'']

'''Lilith:''' Oh, sorry. Were we discussing important revelations? I'll... [''clears throat''] I'll just... do this later.

[''She takes the photo from the camera and sheepishly hides it behind her back. Hooty eats and swallows the camera.'']

'''Hooty:''' Gulp!

'''Luz:''' [''to King''] Maybe you weren't exactly the King of Demons, but...

'''King:''' I was important to someone. [''starts tearing up''] If... If he's out there, I want to find him. I'm not that old! It could be possible! [''sniff''] Would you help me?

'''Luz:''' I'd do ''anything'' for you, buddy.

'''King:''' Then... can we keep him? [''points to the monster'']

'''Luz, Eda and Lilith:''' No!

[''Hooty wraps his body around the girls, who are all looking displeased.'']

'''Hooty:''' Yeeeees!

[''Cut to the Owl House, where Luz is tucking King into bed while he carves the castle's symbol onto his collar medallion with a fork.'']

'''Luz:''' Whatcha doin' there, King?

'''King:''' That symbol was all over that tower. What if it's my name?

[''Luz glues the broken piece of King's horn onto the stump with glue, making it whole again. She wipes off some excess glue with her finger.'']

'''King:''' Aah... gooey..!

[''The camera cuts to a wide shot of King's room, revealing the monster, which King had named "Jean-Luc", sitting lifelessly in the corner of his room.'']

'''King:''' [''put his collar back on''] It's too bad Jean-Luc stopped moving outside the ruins. I liked having a big, scary minion.

[''Luz looks at him and is creeped out by his presence.'']

'''Luz:''' [''sheepishly''] Yeah. Too bad.

'''King:''' Luz, is it okay to still call me "King"? It feels kind of weird when I'm not the king of anything.

'''Luz:''' Well, you'll always be king of my heart. That's good enough, right? 

'''King:''' [''thinks for a moment''] Yeah! Goodnight, Luz.

[''King lies down, and Luz kisses him on the forehead.'']

'''King:''' And Francois.

[''King holds up his plush rabbit. Luz kisses it.'']

'''King:''' Now, Jean-Luc.

[''Luz looks at the inanimate Jean-Luc; some of his fleshy red goop drips onto his knee. Luz grunts in disgust and starts walking backwards towards the door while still facing King sheepishly.'']

'''Luz:''' Bummer, looks like I'm all out of kisses. Maybe next time, goodnight! [''closes the door'']

[''In the living room, Eda and Lilith are looking over the photos that Lilith took of the ruins.'']

'''Eda:''' I've never seen markings like this.

[''Lilith opens one of her books as Luz enters and sits down next to Eda.'']

'''Eda:''' Hmmm... Ooh, is it some kind of ancient language?

'''Lilith:''' And those old carvings. Who were they depicting?

'''Eda:''' [''to Luz''] Any ideas, "mystery whisperer"?

[''Luz picks up one of the photos.'']

'''Luz:''' I don't know. But whatever we discover, we'll be there for King... no matter what.

[''The camera focuses on the photo, which is of the carvings depicting a large, spear-wielding demon who looks similar to King. Cut to black.'']

[''Open in the [[Emperor Belos|Emperor's]] [[Emperor's Castle|Castle]], where Belos has completely rebuilt the [[portal]]. He has an [[Abomaton]] inject a green substance into the door lock before using a pieced together key to open it. However, the key is instantly vaporized. Nearby, [[Hunter]] observes the test when [[Flapjack]] flies by and chirps.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''quietly swats it''] Shoo!

'''Emperor Belos:''' Would you like to see how it works, Hunter?

[''Hunter gasps and hides Flapjack before approaching.'']

'''Hunter:''' I didn't mean to hide, Emperor Belos.

[''Belos turns around, his maskless face is revealed to have a green scar.'']

'''Emperor Belos:''' We found every piece of the door. But without the power of the real key, it refuses to open.

'''Hunter:''' [''curious''] Is it true that rain doesn't boil in the [[Human Realm|human realm]]?

'''Emperor Belos:''' It is. You know, I've been there before. Did I ever tell you that?

[''Hunter shakes his head.'']

'''Emperor Belos:''' The trees there are green, the nights are quiet... I look forward to seeing it again. Were you spying on me just to hear these boring stories?

'''Hunter:''' The operation at the knee, why did you switch me out with [[Kikimora]]?

'''Emperor Belos:''' Everyone has a use, Hunter. Kikimora has her intricate little plans, the [[Coven Scout|scouts]] carry out orders, and you... well, [[the Titan]] has big plans for you, and it would such a hassle to find a replacement. So, right now, you can be useful by staying safe in the castle.

[''Belos escorts Hunter out of the room.'']

'''Hunter:''' If this is punishment for failing my last mission, I swear I can do better!

'''Emperor Belos:''' Good night, Hunter. [''closes door'']

[''Unsatisfied, Hunter turns and runs off.'']

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-''' 

[''[[Amity Blight|Amity]] is walking in a hall of the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] holding a clipboard.'']

'''Amity:''' [[Hooty]], what's your status?

'''Hooty:''' [''breaks through a window''] The perimeter's secured. Nothing's getting past me!

'''Amity:''' Good. [''walks off''] Clean up that mess.

'''Hooty:''' Ma'am!  

[''Hooty sweeps the broken window pieces away with his neck.'']

[''In the kitchen [[Willow Park|Willow]], accompanied by [[Clover]], places bags down on the table.'']

'''Amity:''' Willow, have you gathered the supplies?

'''Willow:''' [''salutes''] Yes, we are ready to attack this on all fronts. 

'''Amity:''' [''gives a thumbs up''] Excellent!  

[''A [[Ghost|white cat]] comes up to her, leaving a dead spider at her feet.''] 

'''Amity:''' Aw, Ghost, did you help too? [''gives Ghost a chin scratch''] Who's a good palisman? Great, now all we need is-

[''[[Gus Porter|Gus]] and [[King]] enter. Gus is holding CDs while King has a speaker, a disc hanging off his intact horn.'']

'''Gus:''' Rain, beach wave...

'''King:''' Something called Lo-fi beats to study and relax to. We've got it all!

'''Gus:''' [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] was rummaging through her basement, and gave us some soothing human noises.

'''Amity:''' That's great! Wait, Eda's still here? [''enters the living room''] Eda, you're supposed to be helping Hooty build our defenses! Huh?

[''Eda's busy clenching with an intense look on her face, until she lets out a scream.'']

'''Eda:''' Whoo! Ah don't mind me, I'm just learning how to turn into Harpy Eda on command. According to these human workouts, you just gotta scream a lot until you force your inner beast out.

[''Eda starts grunting and screaming again, while an unnerved Amity picks up a VHS box titled ''Dragon Claw Z'' and looks it over.'']

'''Amity:''' Uh, this looks ancient.

'''Eda:''' [''takes the VHS box''] What? No, it's only... [''surprised''] 30 years old?! I remember seeing this in theaters.

'''Amity:''' Yes, you're old, who cares? We have a crisis on our hands!

'''Eda:''' Chill bossy boots, everything's fine!

[''Cut to Luz's room. Amity pushes the door open for her and Eda.'']

'''Amity:''' [''gestures''] Does this seem fine to you?!

[''[[Luz Noceda|Luz]] is lying on the floor, still dressed for bed, wearing socks on her hands and completely delirious. A small, humanoid abomination is holding a box of tissues next to her.'']

'''Luz:''' Whoa... it's like I have snakes for arms.

'''Eda:''' [''calm''] Please, she just has the [[Common Mold]]. It's harmless!

'''Amity:''' But she's a [[human]], we have no idea how it'll affect her!

'''Luz:''' [''sits up, pulls out the [[Portal Key|portal key]]''] If I ate the portal key, would I return to the human realm?

[''Luz attempts to eat the key but the [[abomination]] snatches it and gives it to Amity.'']

'''Luz:''' [''reaches out''] Um?

'''Amity:''' [''puts the key around her neck''] I am not giving this back until you're better, okay?

[''Luz pouts and whines before pulling out a game device and texts on it. Amity takes out her own device, the symbols reading U R PRETTY from the side. She lowers it and sees Luz beaming.'']

'''Amity:''' [''not understanding it''] Oh, uh, you got it! 

[''Amity closes the door while Luz makes a confused expression. Everyone has gathered outside her room.'']

'''Willow:''' I gotta admit it Amity, seeing you around more often is... different.

'''Amity:''' I know. But I was taught to see every situation as an opportunity. And today, I'll show Luz that I am an awesome girlfriend!

'''King:''' Feels like just a few months ago you almost got her dissected by your crazy principal!

'''Gus:''' That ''was'' a few months ago.

[''Luz screams. Amity and Eda burst into her room.'']

'''Amity and Eda:''' Luz!

'''Luz:''' [[Echo Mouse|Mouse]], Philip [[Philip Wittebane's diary|diary]] entry!

[''The echo mouse has indeed begun a projection. Luz has a notepad and pencil ready.'']

'''Philip:''' After five years, I have finally found it. A power source so potent it can pierce through realms... [[Titan's Blood|Titan's blood]]. There are old tales of lakes reflecting green trees and blue skies. The Titan's vein runs through the land, and many believe that these wild portals are created when a little of its blood leaks into the water. That is how I came here, so that is the first place I shall look. I will journey back to... [[Eclipse Lake (location)|Eclipse Lake]]. 

[''The projection finishes. The echo mouse squeaks and scuries off as Luz seems to be drawing a picture of Eclipse Lake.'']

'''Luz:''' I have to go to Eclipse Lake! [''runs towards the door''] Ah!

[''Luz attempts to jump out the door, forcing Amity to duck while Willow and Gus back away, but Eda catches her by the waist mid-jump.'']

'''Willow:''' [''pushes her friend back in''] Luz, no! You are not well.

'''Gus:''' [''in the room''] She is shockingly strong!

[''They tie her up in her sleeping bag and toss her on the floor.'']

'''Luz:''' Ugh! 

'''Eda:''' [''looking down at Luz''] Alright Luz, me and King will get your Titan blood if you just CALM. DOWN.

'''King:''' [''jumps on Eda's shoulder''] Yes! Perfect chance to take our new powers for a test drive!

'''Luz:''' You guys are the best. [''hands over her drawing to Eda, who starts to leave'']

'''Amity:''' [''raises her hand''] I volunteer as well. [''follows''] As Luz's girlfriend, I must-

'''Eda:''' I get it, boots, just grab a coat. Willow, Goops, watch over Luz. She thinks she has snakes for arms.

'''Luz:''' Whoa... [''gasps, then hisses at them causing Gus to flinch'']

[''Cut to [[the Knee]], where several scouts and Abomatons are shown mining. Kikimora is standing on an Abomaton's shoulder.'']

'''Kikimora:''' [''shouting''] Dig faster scouts!

'''[[Guard Captain]]:''' Kikimora, these tunnels are unstable, maybe we should slow down?

'''Kikimora:''' Ugh! Not now, captain. This could be my last chance to show Belos what I can do, and I just know that brat Golden Guard will try to spoil it. Hey, Steve! Jump over that chasm before I throw you in it!  

[''Kikimora's mount walks forward.'']

'''Guard Captain:''' [''sighs, shakes her head''] She's getting so paranoid.

[''Nearby, Hunter, wearing a coven scout uniform, hides behind a tree. Flapjack is flying near his head.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''spots the palisman''] Ah! Why do you keep following me?

[''Flapjack chirps.'']

'''Hunter:''' I don't speak palisman. Here's the plan, I slip in with this disguise, I find the Titan blood before Kiki, I give it to Belos, boom! I'm useful again!

[''Hunter is forced to duck when the Abomaton fires a shot that destroys the tree.'']

'''Guard Captain:''' Ma'am, is everything alright?

'''Kikimora:''' [''suspicious''] I just thought I heard an annoying voice.

'''Hunter:''' [''running off''] Ah another way in, we'll find another way in.

[''Flapjack chirps again. Hunter stops and sees a problem walking nearby.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''gasps''] The Owl Lady and her dog, and is that the youngest Blight?

[''Both witches are dressed for the weather, staffs in hand. Amity has the map and is looking at it as she leads the group.'']

'''King:''' This place is crawling with tools. What gives?

'''Eda:''' Titan blood is the most powerful source of magic on the isles. I'm not surprised Belos wants it too.

'''Amity:''' Well we can't afford to mess this up. Luz is counting on me! 

[''Eda and King shoot her a look.'']

'''Amity:''' I mean, us.

'''Hunter:''' Alright, new plan. They can lead us to... 

[''Flapjack grabs his hood and starts pulling him forward.''] 

'''Hunter:''' What? Hey, hey, AHHH! 

[''Hunter falls down the slope, right in front of the small party. The witches raise their staffs.'']

'''Amity:''' [''gasps''] A coven scout! [''conjures a fire spell'']

'''Hunter:''' [''raises his hands''] Uh, yes, I am but a humble scout and I surrender.

'''King:''' Well, that was easy!

'''Eda:''' [''curious''] Not so fast, King. Don't you recognize that annoying voice?

'''Hunter:''' [''slightly hurt''] Why does everyone say that?  

[''Hunter attempts to escape''.]

'''Eda:''' Don't let him get away!

[''Amity summons a jar on her waist and uses the Abomination goo within to tie up Hunter.'']

'''Hunter:''' Argh! [''falls down, mask comes off''] Hmph! 

[''The trio surrounds him.'']

'''Eda:''' This is none other than Belos' right-hand man.

'''Amity:''' [''gasps''] The Golden Guard? He is a lot... scrawnier than I imagined.

[''King laughs while Hunter growls.'']

[''Break. Scene cuts to inside a section of the mine. Eda bursts through a wall with a flip and lands.'']

'''Eda:''' Huh-uh! Did I do it? Did I go into harpy mode?

'''King:''' [''enters through the hole''] No, you just screamed "hoot" and ran headfirst into a wall of ice. Pretty funny actually.

[''As King walks forward, Amity pushes a captive Hunter through the hole with her staff.'']

'''Hunter:''' You can put down your staff, I won't run.

'''Amity:''' Too bad, because I don't trust you.

'''Eda:''' [''looks at some mining equipment''] Huh, this stuff is old.

'''Hunter:''' Ancient witches used to mine the veins for Titan blood-

'''Amity:''' [''bluntly''] They're not paying attention.

[''They look at King sitting on a drill-like device as Eda stands in front of it.'']

'''Eda:''' Go on, fire it! Maybe the adrenaline will kick in and bam! Harpy Eda!

'''King:''' Sounds perfectly safe! [''activates the drill'']

'''Hunter:''' [''shouts''] Wait! Don't-

[''But it's too late: the drill fires off a beam that bounces around the walls. When it heads for the teenage witches, Amity stops the beam using an abomination sphere. Eda and King stare at them.'']

'''Hunter:''' This isn't a normal cave! These walls are made from the veins of the Titan. Any magic you shoot will bounce right back at you!

'''Eda:''' Huh, you must be fun at parties. Hey King, how about you use your new powers to echolocate the lake?

'''King:''' Haha, okay!  

[''King stops at a tunnel, takes a deep breath and lets a sonic wave out.'']

'''King:''' WEHHHHH! 

[''A few moments pass until King looks at his companions and shrugs "I don't know."'']

'''Hunter:''' [''deadpan''] Those two are definitely gonna get us caught.

'''Amity:''' Us? There is no us. Now keep walking.

[''Hunter shrugs and they move on, Flapjack chirping as it follows close by. Back at the Owl House, the three caretakers are in the kitchen: Willow's making a pot of soup while Gus and Hooty are sitting at the table.'']

'''Gus:''' Hooty, we're not gonna make Luz listen to 24 hours of whale noises. What even is a whale? It looks terrifying!

'''Hooty:''' Well, I've never heard of underground Korean hip-hop before!

'''Gus:''' It's human music and it's soothing! [''Hums music'']

'''Hooty:''' [''tries to impersonate a whale, moving to the music'']

[''As they go on, Willow starts to get annoyed.'']

'''Willow:''' [''turns and shouts''] Will you guys please be quiet?!

[''Gus and Hooty silently stare at Willow.'']

'''Willow:''' What if, we play them at the same time?

'''Gus and Hooty:''' [''turn to each other with glee''] OHHHHHAHHHHHH!

[''Cut back to the mine where the owl party marches on.'']

'''Eda:''' You know, Luz told me about a trip to Latissa where she met someone very interesting. 

[''As they go, Flapjack is shown flying around and perching on rocks.''] 

'''Eda:''' "A beat-up blonde with no magical powers," she called him and these are her words: A bad but sad boy. 

[''King bursts out laughing as Hunter turns pink.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''angrily''] If I ever see that human again-

'''Amity:''' [''points at Hunter''] Watch it.

'''Hunter:''' Well at least I'm not delusional enough to think I can turn into a harpy.

[''Eda stops to turn around and hiss at him.'']

'''King:''' Hey come on, give it a rest you two.

'''Hunter:''' Yeah, listen to your rat.

[''King makes an angry indignant noise and grabs Hunter's hair.'']

'''Amity:''' Shhh!

[''They peek over a stone wall and find the scouting party has stopped.'']

'''Kikimora:''' Why are we stopping? Is it the Golden Guard?

'''Guard Captain:''' No ma'am, this is a dangerous area, we need to move carefully.

'''Kikimora:''' [''raving''] Careful takes too long. My butt is on the line and so help me Titan, if you ruin this, I will throw you off the tallest peak of the knee with a smile...

'''Eda:''' [''watching in pity''] Oh, that poor girl is going through something.

'''Amity:''' She's also blocking the path to Eclipse Lake.

'''Kikimora:''' I can smell it, I can see it, I can see...

'''Hunter:''' [''quietly''] We should create a distraction.

'''Eda:''' [''loudly''] We should create a distraction! You kids wait for my signal. [''runs off with King'']

'''Hunter:''' [''leans on the wall, relaxing''] Huh, that was easy! When they're caught, you and me can take the Titan blood for ourselves.

'''Amity:''' Stop talking like we're a team!

'''Hunter:''' We might as well be. The Owl Lady and her pet have nothing at stake unlike us.

'''Amity:''' You have no idea what you're talking - [''her game device beeps: she briefly places her hand over her pocket''] I was gonna say, you have no- [''game device beeps again'']

[''Hunter gives her a look. Amity grunts, turns and takes out the device to check the messages. The device reads U R RAD.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''peeks over to look''] Oof, that doesn't look good.

'''Amity:''' [''points at him''] Stay back! [''pauses''] But what doesn't look good?

'''Hunter:''' Seems clear to me. Come back with results or else... You can figure out the rest.

'''Amity:''' No, Luz wouldn't make that kind of threat. I'm an awesome girlfriend.

'''Hunter:''' Has she told you that?

[''Amity just grunts.'']

'''Hunter:''' We have a lot in common, Blight. We're both trying to show what we can bring to the table. And we can't fail, 'cause there's nothing worse than disappointing someone who thinks you're special.

[''Amity looks down sadly.'']

'''Eda:''' Okay watch this, [''pulls her hair over her face, makes it look like a different face''] I'll be the ghost of miner's past and spook'em out!

'''King:''' You look like one of my hairballs. Let's just do the trench coat thing!

[''A magenta fireball flies between them.'']

'''Eda:''' Ah!

[''The fireball nearly hits Kikimora, causing the Abomaton to activate a shield to protect the scouting party. Eda and King rejoin Amity and Hunter, now making a break for the tunnel.'']

'''Eda:''' Why didn't you wait for our signal?

'''Amity:''' We don't have time to play around. We are getting that Titan blood!

[''As they go, Amity's game device falls out of her pocket without her realising it. Back at the Owl House, Luz is playing with the echo mouse's ears.'']

'''Luz:''' Little mouse, owl house, frilly blouse, boop!

[''Luz taps the echo mouse's head, and it starts showing the rest of Philip's diary entry on Eclipse Lake.'']

'''Philip:''' My journey to Eclipse Lake has been a success, and yet a tragic failure. The tunnels were filled with a substance known as [[Fool's Blood|Fool's Blood]]. It signifies a decaying vein. I was lucky to get out alive, my companions... were not.

[''The projection ends.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] Oh no, I gotta warn them, gotta call! 

[''She reaches for the crystal ball, but accidentally knocks it over, breaking it.'']

'''Luz:''' Dang it!

[''In the kitchen, Willow, Gus and Hooty are wearing headphones connected to a sound mixer.'']

'''Gus:''' These two are train whistles in a thunderstorm and soothing opera screaming.

[''He plays it, and the mixer makes many noises, including the sound of train and thunder.'']

'''Luz:''' [''offscreen''] Willow? Gus? Hooty!

[''It's no good: they can't hear Luz or even see the soup boiling on the stove. Gus begins to tear up from the music.'']

'''Luz:''' Guys! [''falls'']  Ugh! I gotta reach Amity! [''gasps, sees her game device'']

[''Back in the mine, the Abomaton catches the fireball.'']

'''Kikimora:''' There's someone else in the tunnels. I bet it's him, find him!

[''The Coven scouts and the captain run ahead. Kikimora finds Amity's device and picks it up. In the tunnel, Flapjack keeps trying to sit on Hunter's shoulder.'']

'''Hunter:''' Hey! Find a different perch, bird.

[''Amity and Eda gasp. They've found dark blue orbs.'']

'''Eda:''' Is this... Titan's blood?

'''Amity:''' [''looks at the map''] But Eclipse Lake is farther ahead.

'''King:''' Who cares? We did it!

'''Hunter:''' STOP! That's Fool's blood, don't touch it.

'''Eda:''' Oh, so you can keep it all for yourself? Pfft, hard pass! 

[''Eda cracks open Fool's blood, which cracks the floor. Eda chuckles nervously.'']

'''Eda:''' Huh?

[''The crack on the floor widens, and Eda and King fall into it screaming.'']

'''Amity:''' No! [''prepares to mount her staff'']

'''Hunter:''' Wait! Take me with you!

'''Kikimora:''' [''offscreen''] Yoo-hoo, Golden Guard!

[''Kikimora's shadow is seen from the wall. Amity gasps.'']

'''Hunter:''' At least untie me so I can escape! 

[''Amity hesitates.''] 

'''Hunter:''' Please, I don't want to be replaced.

'''Amity:''' Ugh, fine! [''unties Hunter''] So, where will you go now?

'''Hunter:''' Now... [''knocks Amity down'']

'''Amity:''' Ah! [''grunts'']

'''Hunter:''' [''hops in a minecart''] I get to Eclipse Lake before anyone. BYE!

[''Hunter heads down, Flapjack following him once again.'']

'''Amity:''' That jerk! 

[''Her hand bursts into flames but before she can do anything, a shadow looms over her.'']

'''Kikimora:''' Hoo, would you look at this, captain?

'''Abomaton:''' [''grunts'']

'''Kikimora:''' We found our little fire starter.

[''Break. Resume on Kikimora pacing, the captain looming over Amity down on the ground.'']

'''Kikimora:''' So... the Golden Guard is also looking for Titan's blood, and he took off to Eclipse Lake! Haha, I knew it. That little snake is always making me look bad. Well now I can get my REVENGE!

'''Guard Captain:''' [''clears throat''] Ma'am, what about the Titan blood?

'''Kikimora:''' Oh yes, I'll get that too. 

[''Kikimora claps her hands, and the Abomaton turns into a minecart she hops into.'']

'''Kikimora:''' [''evil chuckle''] This is going to be a good day!

'''Guard Captain:''' What should we do with the girl?

'''Kikimora:''' Oh, I don't care 

[''Kikimora and the Coven Scouts ride the minecarts down the shaft with glee. The captain turns to Amity.'']

'''Guard Captain:''' So uh, did you come with anyone else or...? Ugh, this is boring! 

[''The Guard Captain grabs Amity and throws her down the crack, tossing down her game device not long after. Amity screams until she's caught by something, narrowly catching her device. It turns out Eda caught her, and she and King stopped falling after jamming her staff against the walls.'']

'''Amity:''' [''climbs up''] Guys, you're okay!

'''Eda:''' Oh, just barely. Owlbert's knocked out so we can't fly.

[''Sure enough, Owlbert's got swirls in his eyes. Beat.'']

'''King:''' I'm just like throwing it out there, but this would be a great time to bring out Harpy Eda.

'''Eda:''' I don't know how! I've tried yelling at it, scaring it-

[''Owlbert hoots in pain, he's starting to crack.'']

'''King:''' Did you ever think about, talking to it?

'''Eda:''' Hah! I... I guess I didn't but it- it's a wild animal.

'''King:''' You thought ''I'' was a wild animal once.

[''Owlbert cracks even more.'']

'''Eda:''' Okay I'll try, just... ugh, give me a second. 

[''Eda shuts her eyes. A few seconds pass.'']

'''Eda:''' What? You want to make a deal? Wait I- I don't know if I can! 

[''Owlbert hoots again, cracks spreading further.'']

'''Eda:''' Okay okay, I'll do it, just change NOW!

[''Eda transforms into a Harpy and flies out carrying the kids in her arms and her staff with her foot.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Aha, YES!

'''King:''' What did you promise to do?

'''Harpy Eda:''' I don't want to talk about it.

[''As they go, Owlbert detatches from the staff and flies into Eda's hair.'']

'''King:''' I can't wait to see a real life minecart chase!

'''Harpy Eda:''' Huh?

[''The scouting party's minecarts have crashed. Kikimora grunts, then faints. Everyone winces.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Ohhh.

'''King:''' Guess minecart chases are a lot more dangerous than video games make'em seem.

[''As King speaks, Amity spots and reclaims her confiscated staff. She also spots a sign marking the entrance to Eclipse Lake.'']

'''Amity:''' [''points''] There it is!

[''Eda flies towards the tunnel, but an Abomaton grabs her by her leg. The captain is standing spear in hand.'']

'''Guard Captain:''' [''grunts''] I don't know who you freaks are, but that blood belongs to Kikimora!

[''With a surprised yelp, Eds gets flung to the ground. Everyone recovers.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Get to the lake, I'll take care of- AH! AH! UGH! 

[''Eda is flung into the wall.'']

'''King:''' Eda!

[''Amity grabs Kings and runs ahead. The Guard Captain throws her spear at them, but Harpy Eda catches and breaks it.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Alright Owl Beast, let's see what we can DO!

[''Harpy Eda flies above the captain, and performs a drill spin on her. Amity and King reach Eclipse Lake. Amity checks the map (sporting an image of Luz in the lake) and lowers it to look at Hunter digging with a puzzled expression.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''resigned''] Don't worry, I won't pick a fight, there's no Titan blood.

'''Amity:''' Then why are you digging?

'''Hunter:''' [''slightly unhinged''] Hoho it's simple really, Belos needs Titan blood to make a new portal key. Can't get to the human realm without it!

'''Amity:''' [''realizing''] There's blood in the key? 

[''Amity clutches the key, which she brought with her.'']

'''Hunter:''' Since I failed my last mission I thought: "Hey, a chance to make up for it!" But I can't go back empty-handed! [''laughs hysterically''] Not again. Long story short, this is my grave. [''happily''] Want me to make you one too?

'''King:''' This is really bumming me out.

'''Hunter:''' That's just life, rat. Everyone has a use, and if you don't [''blows raspberry''] bye bye! Your friend gets it.

'''King:''' [''looks at Amity''] What's he talking about?

'''Amity:''' [''takes out her device''] Luz has been sending me these strange human codes. I don't understand all of them but, this one seems pretty clear. Come back with results or we're done.

'''King:''' Nyeh! [''rotates the device 90 clockwise'']

'''Amity:''' [''reads''] U-R-RAD. [''clicks the next one''] FOOLS-BLOOD-BAD. U-OKAY? COME-HOME? [''laughs''] Of course! This is Luz we're talking about!

'''Hunter:''' Hey! 

[''Hunter is lying facedown in the dirt. Flapjack is tugging on his cloak.'']

'''Hunter:''' Go find a better witch to be with. 

[''Hunter sadly groans as he gathers dirt on his head. Amity kneels near him and once Flapjack notices her, he flies onto her shoulder.'']

'''Amity:''' You know, you were right. We do have a lot in common. I grew up thinking everything was an opportunity to justify existing, but there are people out there who won't make you feel worthless, you just... have to let yourself meet them.

[''Amity reaches out her hand to Hunter. He looks at it only to notice the portal key. He gasps and slowly gets up.'']

'''Amity:''' [''confused''] What are you...? 

[''She realizes his intention and gasps. Hunter lunges at her attempting to grab the key, but misses when she dodges.'']

'''Amity:''' Oh come on, being nice usually works for Luz!

[''Hunter tries again, only for King to scream at him with Flapjack blocking the sonic wave in staff form. Hunter grabs him and tries to teleport but barely moves much.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''surprised yelp''] Real staffs are weird! Ah!

[''Amity ties Hunter up but he makes a few escape attempts before succeeding. He fires several energy blasts from the air, causing Amity to dodge using her staff. Hunter appears behind her but King tackles him. Hunter teleports around Amity three times, but she blocks him with abomination goo. By the fourth time, she anticipates where he'll pop up and jabs with her staff before punching him with an abomination gauntlet. She proceeds to make a spell circle to summon an abomination behind Hunter that envelops him. Amity gets on her staff to put some distance between them, grabbing King along the way. However, Hunter manages to escape by going underground and punching them with a stone fist sending them in the air. King lands with his horns lodged in a vein while Amity lands using her goo. Hunter appears behind her again.'']

'''Hunter:''' You really wanna help? Then give me that key!

[''He uses his staff to yank the key away, but Amity grabs it as Hunter pins her arm to the wall, with her keeping a goo spike at his neck. The two glare at each other, Hunter panting.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''worn out''] Listen, you're strong, and I'm tired. If this continues, you'll probably escape. But here's the thing, we know where to find you, and your human.

'''Amity:''' [''gasps'']

'''Hunter:''' So just... hand over the key.

[''Amity squeezes the key so hard, a crack is heard.'']

'''Amity:''' [''defeated''] Fine, just... stay away from Luz.

[''Amity drops the key into Hunter's hand.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''walks off''] Appreciate it. I uh- mean that, too.

[''Amity says nothing as he flies out on his staff. Harpy Eda flies in.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Haha, yes! I heard fighting, I'm ready to go. Where's that nerd? 

[''She sees King trying to get out of his position while Amity sits on her knees wearing a grim expression.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Ah. Dang it.

[''Cut back to the Owl House, where Luz has fallen asleep.'']

'''Luz:''' [''snores''] Huh? [''sits up, pillow falls off her head revealing several mushrooms on it, pats face''] I feel great! [''sees and touches the mushrooms''] I wonder if this is permanent. [''gasps''] I gotta find everyone!

[''Luz charges out of her room shaking off the mushrooms only to bump into Willow, the bowl of soup she's carrying flies up and is caught by Hooty.'']

'''Hooty:''' Safe! 

[''Steam rises from him, which causes Gus to cringe.'']

'''Luz:''' Have the others returned?

[''They run to the living room, where King and Amity are trying to pull Eda through the door as Ghost walks off with Owlbert on its head.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Ow ow ow! Just get an [[elixir]]. Ugh I got into harpy mode and now I can't get out.

'''King:''' [''to the kids''] She also ate like, nine voles on the way home.

'''Harpy Eda:''' Hey, I had to keep up my end of the bargain.

[''They finally pull her in, but fall to the floor.'']

'''King:''' OOF!

'''Amity:''' [''holds her head''] Ugh...

'''Luz:''' Amity! [''happily hugs her''] I'm so glad my awesome girlfriend is okay.

[''Amity's look of surprise turns into a blushing smile.'']

'''Amity:''' Me too! [''hugs Luz back'']

'''King:''' No King hug? What is this? [''points at Amity''] You are a swindler and a thief!

'''Luz:''' Come here buddy! [''hugs King tightly'']

'''King:''' I regret this!

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''to Amity''] You wanna break the news or should I?

'''Amity:''' News?

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''counts off''] The empty lake, the Golden Guard, losing the portal key, pfft, today was a disaster.

'''Amity:''' Actually... we might be okay. 

[''Amity looks at her glove now stained with Titan's blood. Fade to the portal key, cracked and leaking blood as Hunter holds it up. Flapjack flies up and chirps.'']

'''Hunter:''' Oh, hey! You stuck with me the whole time, huh, bird?

'''Flapjack:''' [''chirps'']

'''Hunter:''' I think I understood that! I-Is that your name? Can you say it again?

'''Flapjack:''' [''chirps'']

'''Hunter:''' Hahahah, weird. Can you say other things?

[''Hunter begins to walk down the slope with Flapjack following with a chirp.'']

[''The scene opens on a checklist [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda's]] looking over in her room. It reads, "New coat for [[Luz Noceda|Luz]]", "Check itchy boy", "Pay water bill", "Clean [[Hooty]] (?)" and "Burn old dress".'']

'''Eda:''' Luz needs a new coat. [[King]] needs to be checked for fleas. Am I missing anything? [''looks at her reflection''] Oh, you've changed, Owl Lady. [''takes a photo of her with her apprentice and friend at Grom and looks at it''] It's worth it. 

'''Luz:''' [''outside''] And three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight, and nine, and ten!

'''King:''' [''simultaneously''] And weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh!

[''Eda opens her window and smiles as she looks down and sees Luz and King doing pull-ups on her staff in midair.'']

'''Luz:''' Alright, King. What's the first thing you're going to do when you meet your dad?

'''King:''' And ten thousand! Well, once we're done training, I'm gonna move out of that closet, that's for sure. Then, I'm going to ugly cry. Hard!

'''Luz:''' Have you told Eda about your decision to le--? 

'''King:''' Shh! 

[''They hear a noise and looks up. Eda's window is closed. The witch herself is crouching under the window frame.'']

'''King:''' [''outside''] I-- I'm not ready yet. I'm not sure how she'll react.

'''Eda:''' [''sighs''] Everyone's leaving, huh? Even King. I guess I'm no substitute for the real thing.

[''Eda opens her trunk to place the photo in and spots a lute with a raincloud and bolt carved into it. She puts the photo in her hair and picks the lute up.'']

'''Eda:''' Welp, nothing like a good distraction.

[''Eda starts playing a song which we later come to know as Raine's Rhapsody and everything around her starts to float.'']

'''Eda:''' [''gasps''] Has my magic returned?  

[''Stops playing: everything falls down.''] 

'''Eda:''' Oh, guess not. Stupid curse.

[''Eda puts the lute back in the trunk and returns to her list. Behind her, a plant starts to turn black and corrode.'']

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-'''

[''Luz and King are standing on the edge of a cliff, Eda's [[Owl Staff|staff]] in Luz's hand. They fall and fly over the water, maneuvering past several rocks then flying so the sun obscures them. Back with Eda, she's dressed for the day and moved to the living room with her scroll showing the news.'']

'''Announcer:''' And we're back live at the [[Emperor Belos|emperor]]'s [[Emperor's Castle|castle]]! In light of Scooter Crane's retirement, today's ceremony will confirm [[Raine Whispers]] as the next head of the Bard Coven. 

'''Raine:''' Do I have to be on camera?

'''[[Darius]]:''' For [[The Titan|Titan]]'s sake, just say something.

'''Raine:''' [''pulls down hood, faces the camera''] Uh, I am honored to work with Emperor Belos in preparation for the day of uni-bee. Uh, I mean, uni-ly! I mean, uh- oh no, this is going all wrong. Get me outta here! [''runs off'']

'''Darius:''' Just cut the feed. 

'''Eda:''' [''mockingly''] How are you supposed to be Head Bard with stage fright?

[''The door opens; Luz and King have returned but the former is holding a backpack at arm's length while the latter is holding his stomach.'']

'''King:''' I'm sorry, Luz.

'''Luz:''' It's okay, buddy. Hey Eda, got another backpack I can borrow? This one got a little thrown-up in.

'''Eda:''' Closet.  

[''Luz hurries off.''] 

'''Eda:''' So why are you suddenly so interested in flying? Did you give up on returning to the human realm? I mean, I suppose you can stay here a little longer.

'''Luz:''' Oh, no, I'm still going home, but I keep running into some setbacks. 

[''Flashback to Luz looking under a bed.'']

'''Luz:''' Come on, little buddy. You got portal info that I need. 

[''Luz pulls out a carrot, offering it to the [[Echo Mouse|echo mouse]] hiding underneath.''] 

'''Luz:''' You want a carrot? Does baby like carrots?  

[''The mouse runs onto her lap to eat the offering.''] 

'''Luz:''' Here we go. It's okay. See, you're safe here.

[''Hooty, who comes out of nowhere, eats the mouse.'']

'''Hooty:''' Fear not, maiden! Hooty, the guardian owl of Ga'Hoot, has protected you once more!  

[''Luz glares at him.'']

'''Hooty:''' Ga'HOOOOT!

[''The scene returns to the present.'']

'''Luz:''' I was able to get the mouse back safely, but he needs to recover.

'''King:''' In the meantime, this weekend is the [[Gland Prix]]!

'''Luz:''' [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]], [[Glandus High|Glandus]], and [[St. Epiderm]] students race to win glory, honor, and--

'''King:''' Fame! Winners also get an interview with the [[Boiling Isles]] news! Do you realize what this means?

'''Luz:''' We are going to enter the competition and get King on camera to send a message to his dad!

'''Eda:''' Oh, that's... great.

'''King:''' But, uh... there's something I'd like to talk to you about first. You see, I think it's time for me to le-

'''Eda:''' Leave... the talkin' for later. If you want to win, there's no time for talk. You gotta go practice. Now.

'''Luz:''' Wanna head back out while your tummy's empty?

'''King:''' Okay! 

'''Luz:''' Let's go! [''laughs joyfully as she and King exit the house'']

[''Eda's smile soon changes into a frown and she unhappily sighs.'']

[''The scene changes to [[Grimgrub's Pub]].'']

'''Eda:''' I just... don't wanna hear him say it, you know? I was finally getting used to having people in the house, then whoosh! Rug's ripped out from underneath me.

'''Kevin:''' Sure. I get it. It's like every time you come in here, I think, "maybe she'll pay her tab this time". 

[''Eda merely drinks the box of apple blood she has and turns her eyes over to the scene being caused in the pub.'']

'''Wild witch:''' Hey! Back off!

'''[[Coven Guard|Guard]]:''' Don't fret, citizens! We are helping this wild witch find her place in society!

'''Wild witch:''' No! I don't want to join a coven! Let me go!

'''Eda:''' Throw it on my tab, Kevin.  

[''Kevin groans as Eda exits the bar.''] 

'''Eda:''' Let her go!

'''Coven Guard 1:''' Back off, Owl Lady.

'''Coven Guard 2:''' Yeah, no coven wants a powerless witch.

[''Eda decks him in the face hard enough to spin his mask backwards.'']

'''Eda:''' How's that for powerless?  

[''The crowd oohs, and Coven Guard 2 tries to cast a spell on Eda and suddenly, music preformed by a [[Raine Whispers|mysterious violinist witch]] with a mask and a group behind them starts playing and cancels out the spell. A [[Bards Against the Throne|mysterious group]] with instruments and masks play music around a statue in the town square. An enchantment caused by the music appears and causes objects (and [[Tiny Nose]]) to start floating around, much to the crowds amazement. The enchantment disappears as the music stops being played and the mysterious violinist speaks.'']

'''Violinist:''' Look at the emperor lackeys! Trying to, uh... Do I really have to say this?

'''[[Katya|Tambourine player]]:''' We all agreed on the script.

'''Violinist:''' Trying to... mute the music of our hearts?  

[''They groan, clearly embarrassed.'']  

'''Violinist:''' And weaken magic, by forcing witches into covens against their will.

'''Coven Guard 2:''' Blasphemy!

'''Violinist:''' Blasphem-you!

'''[[Amber|Recorder player]]:''' See, you're a natural!

'''Violinist:''' That's right, Bonesborough. They take your magic [''they force the guards into kneeling'']. They restrict your knowledge [''they make the guards march in place.'']. They say to do it in the name of unity, but what they really want is control. You know what we say to that folks? Shove off!

'''Both Guards:''' Stop! No, not the trash! Oh, not the trash! [''they both groan'']

[''They send the guards off marching, but not without making them march into trash cans.'']

'''[[Tiny Nose]]:''' Who are you hewoes?

'''Violinist:''' We are the Bards Against The Throne, aka...

'''Guard:''' Surrounded!  

[''The guard puts on earmuffs as guards surround the group.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from within a manhole''] Psst!

[''The bassoonist creates a smokescreen allowing them to escape. The sewer leads to a pipe outside the city.'']

'''Eda:''' End of the line folks, word of advice. Next time you put on a performance like that, make sure you have an exit strategy.

'''Tambourine player:''' Thank you. How can we ever repay you?

'''Eda:''' Well, you could let me join your little team.  

[''The BATTs gasp.''] 

'''Eda:''' Hey, I may not have magic, but I am an agent of chaos.

'''Violinist:''' Sorry, we're not accepting new members.

'''Eda:''' Is that any way to treat an old friend, ''Raine Whispers''?  

[''Eda flicks off the Violinist's mask, indeed revealing Raine, who at first is shocked but then looks back at Eda with an angry glare.'']

[''Commercial break.'']

'''Eda:''' So, the Head Witch of the Bard Coven likes pretending to be a rebel. Too bad they're not very good at it.

'''Raine:''' [''blushing''] Eda! You're embarrassing me in front of my crew.

'''[[Bards Against the Throne|BATTs]]:''' Huh?

'''Raine:''' [''sighs''] Hey it's all right, everyone. The Owl Lady is an old friend.

[''The remaining members lift their masks.'']

'''Tambourine player/Katya:''' Nice to see you again.

'''[[Derwin]]:''' Is she going to join our group?

'''Amber:''' She doesn't seem like a good fit to me.

'''Raine:''' Actually, she's the one that inspired me to make the group.

'''Eda:''' [''annoyed with Amber at first and'' then is ''shocked''] Huh?

'''Raine:''' It was a while ago.

[''Eda's surprised face fades to her as a young adult smiling.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Raine... I know why you're really here.

'''Young Raine:''' I have no idea what you're talking about.

'''Young Eda:''' Uh-huh.  

[''Eda burns a bolt over a cloud on the lute she's holding. The two are in a meadow.'']

'''Young Raine:''' Who cares about a stupid performance? This is more fun. [''Raine starts looking at Eda, love-struck.]''

'''Young Eda:''' Whatever you say.

'''Young Raine:''' [''adjusts the position of Eda's fingers on the lute.''] See? you'd be a mess without me.  

[''Raine removes their hand and look away flustered, missing the small smile Eda's making. Raine clears their throat.'']

'''Young Eda:''' All right. "Raine's Rhapsody." [''she begins playing the lute, the flowers in the meadow and her hair being enchanted by the music.''] You know, you can't run from your fears forever, which is why you've gotta get the jump on them. Give 'em a whack right in the face.

'''Young Raine:''' [''Young Raine looks at Eda confused, Present Raine narrating.''] I thought you were just joking around. I only learned what it meant when I started teaching for the Bard Coven. The emperor prioritized recruitment through force. And anyone who refused to fall in line disappeared. Well, I wasn't going to stand for that! [''Young Raine gets angry and clenches their left and right fists. They slightly calm down and put their fingers on their forehead, frustrated.''] So I took matters into my own hands. 

[''Return to the present.'']

'''Raine:''' I carefully moved up the ranks, and I found people who wanted to change things, like me. And that's when we formed the Bards Against the Throne, aka...

'''BATs:''' The BATTs! [''they all hiss.]''

[''They notice coven guards searching and begin climbing the embankment.'']

'''Raine:''' [''extends their hand to Eda''] Hey. If you've got nothing to lose, we could use the help.

[''Blushing, Eda happily takes Raine's hand. The camera switches to to Luz and King doing push-ups on Eda's staff, although King has got Hooty doing the work for him. Luz collapses then stands up.'']

'''Luz and King''': [''grunting and panting.''] Whew!

'''Luz:''' All right, King, the Gland Prix is the day after tomorrow. Are you ready?

'''King:''' I, uh, got the jitters. [''squals.''] And I still haven't been able to talk to Eda.

'''Luz:''' Don't worry. She's just been busy this week. 

'''Hooty:''' You've always got Uncle Hooty's shoulder to lean on!

'''King:''' You don't have any shoulders! [''runs away'']

'''Hooty:''' [''following''] Lean on me!

[''Luz sees Eda heading out and approaches her surfing on the owl staff.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda, King's still waiting to talk to you.

'''Eda:''' Uh, maybe later.

'''Luz:''' O-Okay. Well, maybe at the Gland Prix?

'''Eda:''' I'll be there. I promise!

'''King:''' Stay away from me!

'''Hooty:''' Let me be your emotional support!

[''Cut to the BATT's base. Eda rolls out a map.'']

'''Eda:''' Well, there you have it. Homemade maps of every nook and cranny in the city.

'''Raine:''' Okay. Here's the situation. Emperor Belos wants every wild witch in a coven before the Day of Unity.

'''Derwin:''' He's trying to steal as much magic as possible. We don't know why.

'''Raine:''' Right now we're just focused on helping those he's captured. And the next raids take place here, here and here. [''Raine points at 3 different locations on the map that have a circle with an X inside them.'']

'''Katya:''' At the same time? What do we do?

'''Eda:''' Don't worry, kids. Mama's got a plan.

'''Amber:''' You're not our mom!

'''Eda:''' [''The camera changes to Hexan Road. 2 [[Coven Scout|Coven Scouts]] and 1 [[Guard Captain]] are arresting and escorting cloaked witches into a gold and white vehicle with the sigil of the [[Emperor's Coven]] on it. Amber hides in a corner with her flute in hand as one of the Coven Scouts closes the back door to the vehicle.''] As the first team is rounding up witches on Hexan Road, Amber will sneak in and take 'em out.

'''Amber:''' Ugh. Fine. [''Amber plays enchanting music with her flute in the corner and puts all 3 Coven members to sleep.'']

'''Eda:''' [''The camera changes to Derwin and Katya. In Skinford Avenue, Derwin and Katya jump onto a pillar and play their respective insturments, a bassoon and a tambourine, to distract the second team of scouts. As they both jump off of the pillar, two scouts begin chasing them.''] Before anyone calls for help, Derwin and Katya will distract the second team by Skinford Avenue.

'''Derwin:''' That we can do. 

'''Amber:''' And... the captain? [''The camera switches to the Guard Captain of the second team of scouts looking around.'']

'''Eda:''' [''Raine plays one of the strings on their violin which causes the Captain to become trapped in their cowl''.] That's where Raine comes in. 

'''Raine:''' As long as I don't have to make any more speeches. [''Raine then steps forward and takes of their mask, smiling. They proceed to look in Eda's direction and then give her a thumbs up as a signal.'']

'''Eda:''' And if everything goes well, I'll be guiding the escapees outside Bonesborough. Belos has less reach outside the cities. [''Eda opens the back of the van to let the cloaked witches out. The scene changes to the sewer pipe outside of the city, where Derwin and Katya are leading the witches out of the city through the large sewer pipe. The camera pans upward to show Raine and Eda on a balcony, sitting next to each other. As they both look at each other, they look away, Eda blushing.'']

[''While the group is walking back to their base, Amber steps in a puddle of water. By the time the BATTs return, it's morning. Derwin has fallen asleep, so Katya's carrying him.'']

'''Eda:''' [''groans''] I can't believe it's already morning.

'''Amber:''' I'm not tired yet.

'''Katya:''' Amber, you've gotta  calm down. 

[''Everyone chuckles.'']

[''The group walks back into their base.'']

'''Amber:''' We did it! Eda, you're amazing!

'''Katya:''' We actually helped people this time.

'''Raine:''' [''They lie down on their pillow on the floor. They sigh.'']

'''Eda:''' Rainestorm.

'''Raine:''' [''They chuckle.''] Haven't heard that in a minute.

'''Eda:''' Oh, you've gotten so strong. It's incredible. [''She chuckles.''] But how'd you become Head Bard with your stage fright?

'''Raine:''' I'm just that good. What about you? Do you still know any Bard spells?

'''Eda:''' Well, you remember the curse. It messes with my magic. [''She gestures with her hands and looks away.'']

[''Raine summons a lute for Eda. Eda catches the lute and looks at Raine, shocked.'']

'''Raine:''' [''playfully''] How'd you become the Owl Lady with ''your'' stage fright?

[''Eda looks away sporting an embarrassed flush.'']

'''Eda:''' All right. [''sighs''] You asked for this.

[''Eda starts playing enchanting music and as she continues, every object begins to rot, turn black, and corrode, causing Raine to look at her and the objects floating around her. She stops playing. Raine looks at their earring, which nearly corroded.'']

'''Eda:''' [''She chuckles and snorts. Eda looks at Raine.''] Ha! "Raine's Rhapsody". More like "Eda's Requiem", am I right? I-I'll leave the playing to the professionals. Call if you need me. [''leaves the base.'']

'''Amber:''' Bye, Mama Eda!

[''Raine looks down at one of the affected maps.'']

[''Cut to the next day at the starting line to the Gland Prix where the competing students are getting ready. The crowd chatters. Principal Bump talks with the fellow principals of Glandus High and Saint Epiderm High in the background. Eda walks in the vicinity, looking for Luz and King.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda! I'm so glad you made it!

'''King:''' I, uh, would really like to tell you something before the race starts.

'''Eda:''' Well, if it's so important, we can talk about it after the race... when you win, okay?

'''King:''' Uh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

'''[[Perry Porter]]:''' Welcome, everyone, to the Gland Prix! 

[''[[Gus Porter|Gus]] conjures the event name on the [[Crystal Ball|crystal ball]] they're surrounding.''] 

'''Perry:''' Contestants will fly down the right arm to the Cubital Valley. They use speed, cunning, and magic, to race to the checkpoint and back to the finish line! Winners get their names etched on the Cup of Ephemeral Glory!

'''Cup of Ephemeral Glory:''' [g''roaning''] All victory is fleeting.

'''Perry:''' And, an on-camera interview, seen by everyone watching across the Isles! On your marks, get set--

[''The Cup screams, and the racers take off.'']

'''Audience member:''' Go, baby, go! [''to Eda''] Which one is yours? This is so exhilarating!

'''Eda:''' Raine?

'''Raine:''' We got a tip about another raid. I know you're busy, but-

'''Eda:''' No, it's fine. I'm on my way.

[''The group meets near a broken bridge in the forest.'']

'''Raine:''' This should be the spot. [''sees nobody around''] Something isn't right.

[''Katya, Amber and Derwin are suddenly waist deep in abomination goop. Eda and Raine run off and hide as someone appears.'']

'''Darius:''' That feels better.

'''Darius:''' Looks like we missed a few.

'''Raine:''' It's Head Witches [[Eberwolf]] and Darius.

'''Eda:''' So that means?

'''Raine:''' We fell for their trap.

[''Break. Open back at the race: Luz and King, having used an invisibility glyph, appear in front of a St. Epiderm student, scaring him and causing him to fall behind.'']

'''King:''' Haha! Saint Epiderm? More like Stank Epiderm!

[''King nearly falls off the staff and secures himself. He notices how fast Luz is approaching the goalpost marking the halfway point.]

'''King:''' Might wanna slow down for that turn, Luz. We're gonna crash!

[''Instead of slowing down, Luz flies through the goalpost, sticking a plant glyph on it to slingshot them back around. The crowd cheers, as does Principal Bump, who shoots a smug look to the other principals.'']

[''Cut to the forest.'']

'''Darius:''' This place is disgusting. Figure out which one's the turncloak so we can leave.  

[''Eberwolf sniffs the BATTs and shakes their head.''] 

'''Darius:''' Just my luck.  

[''Darius teleports the captured BATTs into the conformatorium.'']

'''Katya:''' [''stands up''] No. No! Not again!

'''Darius:''' I was scheduled for some me time today, so hand yourself over before things get nasty. I know they can hear me. I know you can hear me, Eber, help me out here.

[''Eberwolf draws a spell circle on her forehead. When it vanishes, she uses eye beams and finds footprints leading into the forest.'']

'''Darius:''' I'm not going in there.  

[''Eberwolf throws dirt that he dodges.''] 

'''Darius:''' Agh! What do you think you're doing?  

[''Eberwolf climbs all over him before heading into the forest.''] 

'''Darius:''' You'll regret that, mutt.

[''Darius follows her. Up on a tree branch, Eda and Raine appear having used an [[Invisibility]] glyph. Raine is carrying Eda bridal style, and Eda is no longer wearing her boots.'']

'''Eda:''' I am glad I remembered how to do that.  

[''The glyph disintegrates. They descent into mud.''] 

'''Eda:''' Ooh, gross. 

'''Raine:''' Eda, Belos' plans are a lot more dangerous than I let on. He's preparing some big spell for the day of unity, but he can't do it without every head witch. If we can take out Darius and Eberwolf...

'''Eda:''' Say no more, Rainestorm. What's the plan?  

[''Raine summons the lute.'']

'''Raine:''' You say your curse messes with magic. I think I can make that work in our favor.

[''Darius and Eberwolf are shown to be following Eda's enchanted boots.'']

'''Darius:''' Looks like our traitor is a clever little songbird.  

[''The boots kicks mud all over him. Angered, he uses spikes of abomination goo to destroy the boots.''] 

'''Darius:''' All right, no more playing around!

[''Darius turns himself into abomination goo and forms a sword from the goo, as well. Eberwolf grows claws and talons then summons a rat-worm mount. It's a lot more intimidating than that sounds without context. They return to close to where Eda and Raine are hiding behind a tree. Eda turns around, notices how close she is to Raine and pulls back blushing. Raine summons their instruments and they start playing Eda's Requiem.'']

'''Darius:''' [''hears the music''] There you are.  

[''Darius notices too late that the ground is rotting and he's caught in it. At the same time, Eberwolf and her steed are also caught in it.'']

'''Eda:''' It's working. Keep playing.

'''Raine:''' [''sees they're being consumed''] Look. We may not make it out ourselves.

'''Eda:''' But it'll stop the emperor, right?  

[''Raine nods.''] 

'''Eda:''' Then we play on.  

[''Eda turns around, her photo of her, King and Luz flying out of her hair. Raine sees it.'']

'''Raine:''' Eda, do you have kids?!  

[''Eda stops playing, letting out an offbeat key on her mandolin in shock.'']

'''Eda:''' [''voice breaking''] Uh, they're not mine-mine. Well, it doesn't matter. They both have real families to return to. [''continues playing'']

[''Raine makes Eda's instrument disappear and she collapses on the ground as the withering starts to reverse.'']

'''Raine:''' I don't know what you're running from, but a great witch once told me something about punching fears in the face? What I'm trying to say, don't give up so easily. [''hands Eda back the photo''] They probably need you more than you realize. [''lends their hand to her; she takes it''] We can find another way to stop Belos together.

[''They are suddenly caught in abomination goo and yell: Darius has found them.'']

'''Darius:''' Found you, songbird.

[''Darius starts pulling them back. Eda grabs a tree branch, but sees Raine about to let go of her hand.'']

'''Eda:''' [''tearfully''] Raine, don't.

'''Raine:''' Go. You know I can't stand an audience.

[''They let go and summon the violin to free themselves, landing before their fellow coven heads.'']

'''Raine:''' Hello, Darius. Eber.

'''Darius:''' Raine Whispers. You'll regret what you did to my clothes.  

[''Eberwolf mutters something.''] 

'''Darius:''' And your treachery, whatever.

[''Raine begins fighting the two, while Eda watches from behind a tree. She holds in her tears before running back to the starting line.'']

'''Perry:''' Luz of Hexside and Ukula of Glandus are barreling towards the finish line! And there you have it! Luz over Ukula!  

[''Eda claps.''] 

'''Perry:''' For fifth place.  

[''Eda stops clapping, confused.''] 

'''Perry:''' And now, let's give a hearty applause to our actual winner!  

[''The top three step up to the podium.'']

'''Luz:''' [''covered in leaves and branches''] Hey, Eda.

'''Eda:''' You were flying like the dang wind. What happened?

'''Luz:''' We were winning for a while, but-  

[''Cut to a flashback to her and King flying; King is about to vomit again.'']

'''King:''' Luz?

'''Luz:''' King, try to hold it in.

'''King:''' I can't!

'''Luz:''' King!  

[''Cut to black as King vomits. Back to present.]''

'''Luz:''' And then we crashed.

'''King:''' It's okay. I'll just throw my message into the garbage where it belongs.

'''Eda:''' No, this isn't over.  

[''Eda summons her scroll and starts recording.'']

'''King:''' Eda, who's even gonna watch this?

'''Eda:''' No one watches crystal balls anymore. It's all about streaming.

'''King:''' All right. Hi dad. If you're out there watching this, I uh, want to introduce myself. 

[''As King goes, [[Willow Park|Willow]] is shown watching the video in her room, with Clover perched on her head.''] 

'''King:''' I like cheesy foods and conquering kingdoms. Though I haven't conquered any of my own yet.   

[''[[Amity Blight|The]] [[Emira Blight|Blight]] [[Edric Blight|children]] are also shown watching at their [[Blight Manor|manor]].''] 

'''King:''' But maybe you have, and we can compare notes. I'd love to meet you. We could do parent kid stuff, toss a ball, burn some cookies, catch me going on weird websites or something. Also, I found a symbol in the tower I hatched in.  

[''Somewhere else, an [[Tarak|unnamed demon]] is also watching and, upon hearing about the symbol, looks off into the distance.''] 

'''King:''' Maybe you can teach me to read it. I live with my favorite human and a cranky old witch.

'''Eda:''' [''offscreen''] Hey!

'''King:''' But cranky or not, she's the one who raised me, which is why I am le... [''pulls out a stack of papers''] ..gally changing my name to King Clawthorne! [''laughs''] Surprise Eda! Now we're connected for life and there's nothing you can do about it!

'''Eda:''' [''shakily''] Is that what you wanted to tell me this whole time? [''sniffs and grabs the papers'']

'''Luz:''' [''pulls out a pen''] And, if you sign here, it be official. [''Eda starts to cry.'']  

'''Luz:''' Eda, are you okay? [''Eventually, Eda bursts out sobbing of joy.''] 

[''In the forest Raine, now injured, is trapped in abomination goo as Eberwolf watches the stream.'']

'''Luz:''' [''from livestream''] Eda, if you keep doing that, [''starts to cry as well''] I'm gonna cry too! [''both Eda and Luz burst out crying'']

'''Darius:''' Would you shut that off? We're supposed to be tormenting Raine, not me. 

[''Eberwolf sets the volume to maximum.''] 

'''Darius:''' [''exasperated''] Why are you like this?

[''Raine escapes but is captured again, this time by an [[Abomaton]].'']

'''[[Kikimora]]:''' [''atop the shoulder''] Leaving so soon?

'''Darius:''' I told you we didn't need help! So get that ugly thing out of my face. And tell [[Alador Blight|Alador]] he's a hack while you're at it.

'''Kikimora:''' Emperor Belos was rather upset to learn that you had a hand in the recent raid incidents.

'''Raine:''' Guess I can look forward to my own petrification, huh?

'''Kikimora:''' No. It'd be too much of a hassle to find a replacement.  

[''Kikimora activates Raine's coven singil, which begins encasing them in a vine cocoon.''] 

'''Kikimora:''' The Emperor needs you alive and well the [[Day of Unity]]. But until then, [''waves''] night night. [''screen slowly becomes encased in red aura that turns to black'']

[''Scene opens with something cooking in a pot on a stove. [[King]] puts on mittens and takes off the pot, then walks over to the table and pours the stuff onto a pancake (???). [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] is standing nearby looking at the desserts King had prepared. She's wearing her Grom outfit from "[[Enchanting Grom Fright]]".'']

'''Luz:''' Wow, King. This looks great!

'''King:''' Thanks. I- I hope they like it too.

[''Someone knocks on the door.'']

'''[[Hooty]]:''' Hooty-hoot! We have visitors!

[''What Hooty said grabs Luz's and King's attention.'']

'''King:''' They're here!

[''Scene cuts to [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] going up to the front door and open it. Hooty is seen wearing a bowtie. Outside the door stood a mustached [[Demon|demon]] wearing a fedora which resembles King. Two tiny demons which resemble King then pop out from behind him. Cut to kitchen where Luz gathers up some dirty dishes and take them away from the stove. [[Owlbert]] flies into the scene wearing a top hat. Eda brings the mustached demon and his children over to the kitchen. She is also wearing her Grom outfit.'']

'''Eda:''' Welcome to the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]], folks. Hope this place wasn't too hard to find.

'''Mustached demon:''' Not at all! Thank you for having us.

[''King runs up to greet the mustached demon.'']

'''King:''' King of Dads! You made it!

[''King and his dad proceed to give each other a hug.'']

'''King's dad:''' Wouldn't have missed it for the world, son. I'm so happy we saw that video of yours. Now, maybe after dinner, we can have a nice game of catch.

'''King:''' [''excitedly''] Really???

'''King's dad:''' [''to his children''] Prince of Brothers, Prince of Sisters, do you have something to say to your big bro?

'''King's siblings:''' Big brother!

[''King's siblings run up to give King hugs. King hugs them back. Cut to Luz, King, Hooty, Owlbert and [[Echo mouse]] waiting over at the table.'']

'''Luz:''' Please have a seat, Your Honorable Mr. Dr. King of Dads. King prepared a special feast for you all.

'''King's siblings:''' Hungry!

[''King's siblings run up to the table and climb up the bench. King's dad approach the table from behind them.'']

'''King's dad:''' [''laughs''] Patience, children. It would be rude not to [''tips hat''] give thanks first.

'''King:''' Oh! Oh! I can start! [''clears throat''] I'm thankful that my demon family finally got to meet my owl family.

[''Everyone becomes happy and look at each other after hearing that.'']

'''King:''' Seriously, thi- this is amazing! I- It's almost like... a dream...

[''A sudden realization hits King and he looks up at everyone sadly.'']

'''Eda:''' King...

[''The screen turns white. Cut to King curling up on the floor sleeping with an uneasy expression on his face. Eda puts her hand on King and calls out to him.'']

'''Eda:''' King... King, come on. It's time to wake up.

'''King:''' NYEH! [''jolts up''] What's going on? Is there trouble?

'''Eda:''' We're about to find out.

[''Eda and King peeks out from the doorway. Cut to Luz kneeling down in front of a table in the living room with a sad expression on her face.'']

'''Eda:''' Luz is ready to talk.

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|OPENING THEME,]] but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.''']

[''Scene begins with a flashback moment from inside [[Emperor Belos|Belos']] [[Mindscape|mindscape]], when the [[Collector]] shows themself and moves their way towards the [[portal]], changing into multiple abstract picture forms along the way.'']

'''Collector:''' Let's slash and rend and crush and bruise. Let's curse the land in nine bright hues!

[''After reaching the portal, the Collector transforms into a picture form depicting 9 person lifting up their hands in a worshipping position. They then transform again to depict a screaming [[The Titan|Titan]] and people being shattered into pieces.'']

[''Scene changes to show the moment Luz becomes angry after [[Hunter]] gets sucked into the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm gonna tell ''EVERYONE'' about the Day of Unity, that you've been lying about the Titan for ''YEARS!''

[''Scene changes to show [[Inner Belos]] picking up a broken [[Golden Guard]] mask.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' I'll do anything to save humanity from evil.

[''As Inner Belos is about to finish his sentence, the scene transitions into a hyperrealistic pencil drawing of Luz depicting a manically grinning Inner Belos holding up the mask, which the words "Witch Hunter!!" written beside it. The camera zooms out to show 2 other pencil drawings on the table, one depicting the portal and one depicting the picture frame from Belos' mind showing past moments, Philip Wittebane, and Belos' mask.'']

[''Scene changes to show King and Hooty looking at Luz with a shocked expression on their faces. Eda looks down at the drawings, hand clasping over her mouth. She then looks up at Luz. Cut to Luz sitting across the table staring back at them, looking despondent. She is covered with a blanket and holding a cup of hot drink. King's toy plushies is stacked behind her.''] 

[''Cut to Eda facepalming herself.'']

'''Eda:''' [''inhales deeply''] This is just a lot to take in.

'''Luz:''' We don't have ''time'' to take anything in. We have to stop Belos! I- I was a part of his plan! I-I fell for everything!

[''As Luz speaks, she stands up and hugs herself. She then becomes emotional and starts tearing up, almost on the verge of crying.'']

'''Eda:''' King, Hooty, you know what to do.

[''King and Hooty go up to hug her.'']

'''Eda:''' Well, one thing's for sure. People can tell when you've been inside their head. It's only a matter of time before Belos sends his [[Coven Scout|scouts]] over here. ''You'' need to hide.

'''Luz:''' I'm not hiding. I'm gonna stop Belos from completing the [[Draining Spell]]. I... just... need to figure out how.

[''[[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] suddenly appears at the door way along with Owlbert.'']

'''Lilith:''' Edalyn!

'''Hooty:''' ''LULU!''

[''Hooty immediately stretches towards Lilith, accidentally tightening his body around Luz and choking her.'']

'''Lilith:''' I came as fast as I could. Owlbert filled me in on the Draining Spell. Oh, Titan, I can't believe this is what the Day of Unity was about the whole time. Ugh, I was such a fool, a dolt, a chump, a-

'''Eda:''' Hey, no pity parties in this house. Besides, Luz is upset enough as it is.

[''Luz turns around and stares at Lilith, teary-eyed, whimpering.'']

'''Lilith:''' You're right. I'll do anything to help.

[''Hooty gets really close to Lilith and squishes her face.'']

'''Hooty:''' Lulu! I am so happy to see you, I could- I could...

[''Something goes up from inside Hooty's stomach towards his mouth as he makes a retching sound. In the process, King gets dragged by the garbage.'']

'''King:''' Weh?

'''Hooty:''' Oh, here it comes!

[''Hooty proceeds to throw up some garbage and spirits he had swallowed before on the ground (and unintentionally, King).'']

'''Luz:''' Ugh! Gross.

'''Lilith:''' Oh, my word!

'''Eda:''' Hooty, you gotta stop eating garbage from the ground.

[''King finds a letter addressed to him among the pile of garbage.'']

'''King:''' Huh? WEH! [''emerges from the pile''] He's also been eating our mail. Look!

[''King opens the envelope and takes out a letter. A piece of rock falls out from the letter into his hand.'']

'''King:''' [''reading the letter''] "Dear King [[Clawthorne family|Clawthorne]], if you wish to know who you truly are, come to this location and meet our warrior clan." [''to the others''] I think ''they'' might be my family! And maybe they're an answer to all our problems!

[''Scene focuses on the bottom of the letter showing the map of the location.'']

'''Luz:''' That's incredible! But... how is it supposed to help us stop Belos?

'''King:''' They're a clan of warriors! How else do you defeat a tyrant with their own army? By making an army of your own!

'''Lilith:''' Well, it's... not like we have many allies.

'''Luz:''' Not to mention it's a chance for King to find out where he came from. I say let's go for it!

'''Eda:''' [''skeptical''] Well, I say you two need a safe place to hide while the adults take care of things.

[''Luz and Eda stare at each other angrily, then turn away from each other and make a "hmph" sound, while also crossing their arms.'']

'''Lilith:''' I'm actually in favor of this plan.

'''Eda, King and Luz:''' [''surprised''] You are?

'''Lilith:''' It wouldn't hurt to check. Plus, [''stands up and walks away''] judging by King's map, you two would be taken far, far away from the [[Boiling Isles]] and Emperor Belos.

'''Eda:''' What if something goes wrong?

'''Lilith:''' Hooty could accompany them. Their safety would be your responsibility, my dear, brave Hootsifer.

[''Hooty becomes touched by Lilith's words and starts tearing up.'']

'''Hooty:''' I would protect these silly children with my life!

[''As he speaks, he stretches towards Lilith and bows before her; Lilith does a small curtsy in response.'']

'''Eda:''' [''groans''] Yeah, well, how- how would they even get there?

'''Luz:''' I know a ship that might take us.

'''King:''' Yeah! The ole [[Selkidomus]] crew. Think about it! Belos won't be able to withstand a whole army of mes.

'''Lilith:''' Such allies would be quite valuable.

'''Luz:''' I wonder if I still have my sailor's hat.

'''Hooty:''' Does anyone feel that marching around the edge of the forest?

[''Eda eventually relents.'']

'''Eda:''' Fine. You can go. We'll find out all we can on our end to create a plan for uh... uh, when you get back.

[''Luz stands up and runs towards Eda.'']

'''Luz:''' Thank you, Eda! We won't let you down.

[''Luz and King both hug Eda.'']

'''King:''' Let's pack for the trip!

[''Luz and King run off.'']

'''Hooty:''' Wait for me!!!

[''Hooty follows them from behind in his porta-Hooty backpack.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''to Eda''] You know you made the right choice, don't you? Plus, I've explored that area, there is nothing of note. Whoever wrote that letter was sending them on a wild ''Luz'' chase.

[''Lilith proceeds to laugh at her pun, but Eda covers her face and starts crying instead.'']

'''Lilith:''' Oh, no, no, no. No, no, don't cry! Oh, the joke wasn't that bad, was it?

'''Eda:''' [''crying tone''] Oh, this is so much bigger than I imagined, Lily. I thought Luz was just some lost kid, but because of me she's wrapped up in this thing with Belos and it- it's just not fair. She and King are children. They shouldn't have to deal with this.

[''Lilith gives Eda a hug.'']

'''Lilith:''' We have a whole week until the Day of Unity. We'll figure out how to keep them safe.

[''Eda moves away from Lilith and smiles at her gladly.'']

'''Eda:''' Alright, let's get to work. [''sheds off a tear'']

[''Scene cuts to somewhere on the sea during nighttime. A ship passes in front of the camera and sails off at a high speed. Cut to someone shoving some coal into the furnace on the ship, making the fire grow larger. Camera zooms out to show [[Salty]] closing the furnace door and walks away from it, wiping away his sweat. He then leans on the handrail of a staircase where King is sitting at.'']

'''King:''' Doin' a lot of work there, Salty. Where's the crew?

'''Salty:''' Well, I'm no longer working for the Golden Guard. So, me mates abandoned ship for greener, [[Snail|snailier]] pastures. They were like family to me too.

[''After hearing what Salty said, King becomes sad and looks down at a photograph he is holding, which shows a drawing from inside the building of the [[Uncharted Island]] depicting a demon of his kind fighting an unknown creature.'']

'''Luz:''' Land ho!

[''Luz's shouting grabs King's attention. Cut to Luz on the front of the ship with Hooty.'']

'''Luz:''' Land ho!

[''King approaches the duo from behind. Cut to the trio staring at a tall object in front of them.'']

'''Hooty:''' Is that a finger? It's a long way from our Titan.

'''Salty:''' That's 'cause it's not ''from'' our Titan. This be part of a different beastie.

[''Cut to Luz rowing away from the boat in a bathtub along with King and Hooty.'']

'''Salty:''' [''waves''] Come back with a good story, sea squirts! If ye come back at all!

'''Luz:''' Aw, he's so supportive.

[''Scene cuts to the bathtub being parked on the beach. Camera tilts up to show the trio going up a fleet of stairs.'']

'''King:''' Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh!

[''King arrives at the top but finds himself staring a wall. Luz and Hooty approach him from behind.'']

'''Luz:''' Is anyone here?

'''Hooty:''' Maybe we're a bunch of early birds.

'''King:''' Or maybe they got sick of waiting! That letter was over a month old...

'''Luz:''' Hang on.

[''Luz runs up to the wall and stops.'']

'''Luz:''' There's something here.

[''Luz notices a hole on the wall. She takes out the rock from King's letter and inserts it into the hole. This activates some sort of mechanism and sends some energy up the wall, creating a force field strong enough to rock the surface of the sea and Salty's boat. Salty shuts his eyes, then looks ahead in shock. Cut to the energy going all the way to the fingertip, creating a large circle which produces thunder and lightning. A blue light beam then shines through the circle and drags Luz, King and Hooty upwards.'']

'''King:''' Whoa-

'''Luz:''' Ah!

'''King:''' Whoa-

'''Luz:''' Here we go!

'''King:''' Whoa!!!

[''The trio goes through the circle. Cut to a dock at an unknown location. A lightning strikes the end from the circle at the cloud above, which then shines a blue light beam on the same location. The trio emerges from the light beam, but they are spawned in mid-air and immediately start falling while screaming. Cut to the trio on the ground, showing that Hooty had wrapped himself around Luz and King, cushioning their fall. The rock from King's letter falls from above and lands in front of Luz.'']

'''Hooty:''' Luz, are you okay? Where's your other arm?

'''Luz:''' I only ever had two, Hooty. Did you think I had more?

[''As Luz speaks, she lifts Hooty up and throws him to the ground. King jumps off and looks to his right. Luz then picks up the rock from the ground.'']

'''King:''' Luz, look!

[''The trio finds themselves staring at piles of bones and skeletons lying on the sea not far away from them.'']

'''Hooty:''' That doesn't look like the Boiling Isles to me.

'''Unknown:''' That's because it isn't.

[''The trio turns around to find a tall demon which resembles King walking towards them.'']

'''Unnamed King-like demon:''' Welcome to the other side of the world.

[''Cut to Luz and King giving the stranger a strange look. Hooty's mouth is wide open and he has a shocked expression on his face.'']

'''Unnamed King-like demon:''' You dare trespass on this sacred-

[''The demon notices King and gasps.'']

'''Unnamed King-like demon:''' By the Huntsman, 'tis King! My name is [[Tarak]]. Hail and well-met.

'''King:''' Uh, y-yeah! 'Tis King!

'''Luz:''' Psst! King! Introduce us!

'''King:''' Right! Uh, this is Luz the human/friend/sister. And this is Hooty, the, uh, door...?

'''Luz:''' Your warrior-ship.

[''Luz and Hooty bow at Tarak.'']

'''King:''' Did you send me that letter? Are... A-are you my-

'''Tarak:''' Father? Alas, no. Nor is he here.

[''King becomes dejected. Tarak walks up to him.'']

'''Tarak:''' But I did [''squats down''] send the letter. And by the sight of you, I know he was one of us. He passed down that handsome skull of yours, didn't he?

[''King giggles. Tarak stands up.'']

'''Tarak:''' Now we celebrate! Everyone will be so happy to meet you.

'''Luz:''' Who's everyone?

[''Tarak brings them over to a ledge and shows them a settlement down below.'']

'''Tarak:''' Welcome to [[Titan Trapper Island]]!

[''King gasps and his eyes light up.'']

[''Scene changes to show a view of the whole island from far away above the sky. Cut to Tarak bringing the trio into the settlement, with plenty of other demons which look like King around.'']

'''King:''' I've never seen so many demons that look like me!

[''He notices some warriors training nearby.'']

'''King:''' Look at them go!

'''Tarak:''' We are [[Titan Trapper|Titan Trappers]], under oath to protect the world of giant monsters of death and destruction. But uh, not many of us have seen a live one, of course. [''laughs and clears throat''] Come!

[''Cut to Tarak pushing open a double door and leading the trio into a building.'']

'''Luz:''' Aren't Titans extinct?

[''Luz notices something in front and gasps. Scene changes to show a large skeleton of an unknown creature standing in the middle of the building, looming above everyone. There is also a spiral staircase right in the middle of the building.'']

'''Tarak:''' Not all of them. The Grand Huntsman says one remains, so we sharpen our spears until the vile creature rears its head and a new hunt can begin!

[''Multiple King-like demons walk up and surround the trio.'']

'''Tarak:''' And now, dear King... you can join us and become a Titan Trapper yourself!

'''King:''' Weh?!

[''Luz and Hooty gasp. Everyone around proceed to cheer.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh, my gosh. [''kneels down''] King, that's amazing! [''stands up''] Well, we don't know any Titans, but the world could definitely use your help.

'''King:''' That's right! It's a lot to explain right now, but could you- I mean, we, help the people of the Boiling Isles?

'''Demon 1:''' Any enemy of yours is an enemy of ours!

[''Everyone around proceed to cheer. They then whisk King away.'']

'''Tarak:''' [''to Luz''] But we can make no vows. For that you must beseech our elder, the wisest hunter of them all... [[Bill]]!

[''Tarak gestures towards somewhere above.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] Is that short for something?

'''Tarak:''' Nope. [''shrugs''] Just Bill. He's so cool, he actually met our god, the Grant Huntsman! He's my best friend. Eh, it's no big deal.

'''King:''' Luz! Luz!

[''King runs up to Luz. She kneels down in front of him.'']

'''King:''' Look what that gave me!

[''King takes out a large hand-held object with a jaw at the top. The jaw then starts opening and closing.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh! Oookay. That looks awfully pointy, buddy.

'''King:''' Don't worry. It's mostly paper mache. And bone. They're gonna show me their Titan Trapper ways, Luz! [''gasps''] I guess they're my ways, too.

[''Luz leans forward and stares at King.'']

'''Luz:''' How about Hooty and I go see the elder, and in the meantime, you learn all you can about being a Titan Trapper?

[''King's eyes light up.'']

'''King:''' This is a dream come true!

[''As he speaks, King runs up to hug Luz. He then runs away dragging the object he was just given along the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' Just be careful!

'''King:''' I will!

'''Hooty:''' [''looks at Luz doubtfully''] Are we really leaving him alone?

'''Luz:''' He should have time to get to know his family.

[''Scene cuts to some King-like demons standing around King. They are all clapping while looking down at him. King has a joyous expression on his face. Luz and Hooty stand up while looking at them.'']

'''Luz:''' Besides, [''turns around and walks away''] we have a job to do.

[''Cut to the demons still clapping while looking down at King.'']

'''Demon 1:''' Alright, King. Ready to become a Titan Trapper?

[''King nods. After that, he is given a bat and uses it to hit a piata, causing the candies inside to fall into the hands of the clan members nearby. Demon 1 pats King's head, making him feel touched. Then, he is taken to a hot spring, and he proceeds to stand under a waterfall on one leg as the clan members cheer on. After that, in another activity, he rides on Demon 1's shoulder and uses his sonic scream to shout through a horn. The sound waves hit a flying [[Griffin]], causing it drop down temporarily before flying off again. Demon 1 then throws him over into another clan member's palm, who proceeds to put a headband (???) with a beard onto King's head before putting him on the ground. King's becomes delighted at this gesture.'']

[''Scene changes to Luz and Hooty looking up at something. Cut to them and Tarak standing in front of a door.'']

'''Tarak:''' [''retreats''] I shall take my leave. [''comes back''] Tell Bill I said hi.

[''Tarak retreats again. Luz then pushes the door open and goes inside with Hooty.'']

'''Luz:''' Hello?

[''Luz and Hooty look around, and Luz notices a sword in a wooden bucket nearby.'']

'''Luz:''' Whoa. Look at all these stuff, Hooty! [''takes out the sword''] This will help us defeat Belos for sure.

[''The blade then turns into dust, much to the duo's dismay. Luz turns around, notices a spear among the weapons displayed on the wall and gasps. She then goes up to take it.'']

'''Luz:''' [''laughs''] Yeah!

[''The end of the spear proceeds to spin, then becomes limp, much to Luz's dismay. Hooty gives Luz a ?? look.'']

'''Luz:''' [''upset''] Hmm...

'''Bill:''' Tarak? Is that you?

[''Cut to Bill sitting on his throne reading a book, titled "The Last Titan: A Study of the Boiling Isles", written by [[Flora D'splora]].'']

'''Bill:''' I told you to stop rummaging through my stuff!

[''Bill puts down his book. Luz walks up in front of him to show herself.'']

'''Luz:''' Tarak's not here. It's just us. [''clears throat''] Uh, greetings. [''bows along with Hooty''] My name is-

'''Bill:''' What's that? [''pulls a horn and puts it over his ear''] Speak up! You barge in like an angry Titan only to whisper like the wind?

[''Luz walks closer to him.'']

'''Luz:''' Greetings! [''kneels down''] Uh, this... lowly traveler begs an audience with the great Bill.

[''Luz crawls closer to the horn.'']

'''Luz:''' Mayhaps we might [''puts her head into the horn, amplifying the sound''] perchance to venture to uh-

'''Bill:''' Oh, for the love of- [''pushes the horn aside''] Tarak sent you here, didn't he?

'''Luz:''' He said you were the wisest of all the Trappers. And also his friend. He says hi.

'''Bill:''' Of course he does. What do you want?

'''Luz:''' I'm here to ask if you would lend me your mighty warriors. You see, Emperor Belos has threatened to-

'''Bill:''' Ha! That upstart on the carcass Kingdom? He's no big deal. I've got battle scars older than his reign as Emperor! Wanna see?

[''Bill lifts up his shirt to reveal a scar on his torso.'']

'''Luz:''' We're good. But... please understand, Mr... Bill, a lot of people are in danger and- and they don't even realize it.

'''Hooty:''' Yeah, that dude is straight up evil.

'''Bill:''' Don't worry, we'll help.

[''Luz's and Hooty's face lighten up.'']

'''Bill:''' But if you think Belos is evil, you've never seen a live Titan. The children out there haven't either.

[''The trio looks outside the window, but Hooty notices something to his right and stretches towards that direction. Cut to the King lookalike demons cheering at him as he stands in front of a waterfall.'']

'''Bill:''' Don't know a thing about their ravenous appetites, or their terrible cries! Even their babies act like little monarchs. The last living Titan, I saw it once before it disappeared. Its hateful roar blew out my eardrums. How did it go? "Weh!"

[''Luz suddenly realizes something.'']

'''Luz:''' So, Titans are always hungry, act like monarchs, and say "Weh"?

'''Bill:''' The Huntsman wants us to find the last one. 

[''Bill gestures to a poster next to him. Scene then focuses on the title which says "THE LOST SON OF THE BOILING ISLES".''] 

'''Bill:''' Only a Titan's power can free him from his prison. But we've had no luck. Nice poster, right? I- I took a printmaking class once. Eh, not sure about the font though, I- I feel like the serifs...

[''Bill turns away from Luz as he speaks. Hooty suddenly appears next to Luz and calls out to her.'']

'''Hooty:''' Luz! Follow me!

[''Luz walks away. Cut to Hooty lifting up a curtain. Camera zooms out to show a room in front of them. Scene changes to show some wall carvings and skulls which resembles King's species, and a shrine at the end of the room.'']

'''Hooty:''' Oh, hey! Thought I'd get Lulu some souvenirs. 

[''Hooty uses his beak to grab a snow globe from a rack next to him and shakes it. Scene focuses on the globe, which has stars and a face which looks like the [[Collector]] in it. The Collector's laughter can be heard.'']

'''Luz:''' [''realization''] Their god is that collector kid?

[''Bill lifts up the curtain and appears next to Luz and Hooty.'']

'''Bill:''' Ah! You've found the shrine to the Huntsman. It's been my little DIY project for years. 

[''Luz raises her eyebrows.'']

'''Bill:''' [''rolls up his sleeve''] You like our disguises? [''takes off his glove to reveal a hand''] You gotta look like a Titan to trap one. [''puts on his glove back''] But if I ever find that missing Titan, I'd hunt it down, tear it limb from limb, and mount its head in pride as we release the Huntsman! Then... we can finally go from being Titan Trappers to Titan Slayers! Say, who's your buddy's tailor? His costume looks so real!

[''Luz and Hooty are completely shocked at what they've heard. Hooty opens his mouth in shock, causing the snow globe to drop to the ground and shatter into pieces. The duo then looks at each other. Cut to Luz retreating outside from the room.'']

'''Luz:''' Uh... This has all been super cool, but I gotta go check on, um, things.

[''As she speaks, she turns around and walks away from Bill while holding Hooty.'']

'''Bill:''' But what about the uh... What were you talking about? Th- Th- The- Your quest. With Belos.

'''Luz:''' Oh, ha! I- I'm sure it'll work itself out. Really. Oookay, bye!!!

[''Luz hurriedly leaves, but Hooty accidentally gets sandwiched in between the doors before getting pulled out. Cut to Luz running down a hallway.'']

'''Luz:''' We gotta get King out of here now!

'''Hooty:''' THEN RUN FASTER!!!

[''Hooty stretches forward to make Luz run faster.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm trying!!!

[''Cut back to Bill inside his room with a suspicious look on his face.'']

'''Bill:''' Hmm...

'''King:''' [''outside''] Weh!

[''Bill's eyes grow larger and look to his back. Cut to outside the window where some clan members are throwing King up and down.'']

'''King:''' [''outside''] Weh!

[''Scene goes outside and nearer to the clan members throwing King up and down.'']

'''King:''' Weh!

[''Bill looks from inside the window with a look of sudden realization on his face. Cut to a room filled with weapons and mounted skulls.'']

'''Tarak:''' Now... [''pushes the curtain aside and comes in with King''] Behold! Our armory.

'''King:''' Whoa! There's all sorts of things I shouldn't touch.

'''Tarak:''' Aye, for now. But when you grow older, [''chuckles''] I will be delighted to show you how to dismember your enemies. 

'''King:''' [''eagerly''] You would do that??? Can you also tell me what this means?

[''King shows Tarak the symbol which he carved onto the metal plate of his collar.'']

'''Tarak:''' I- I'm not sure what that is. But... maybe we can find out together. I assume your father was lost in a hunt of yore. But a Titan Trapper is never alone. I'm just happy to see he passed down this. [''knocks on his skull'']

[''King becomes teary-eyed and wipes away his tears.'']

'''King:''' Can I ask a favor? [''sniffs''] It's a little silly, but, uh... Can we play catch?

[''Tarak appears to be surprised by King's request. King looks up at him with teary eyes.'']

'''Tarak:''' I believe you may [''points somewhere in front''] find some equipment thither. 

'''King:''' [''gasps''] Thither?

[''King runs off to the direction Tarak pointed at. A [[Crow Phone|crow phone]] caws and approaches Tarak from behind.'']

'''Tarak:''' Ah! Bill! Tis Tarak. What sayeth you friend?

'''Bill:''' [''on the phone''] Shut it. Listen, that kid you're with...

[''King finds a glove and a ball from a chest nearby. He puts on the glove and throws the ball upwards, intending to catch it, but the ball misses his hand and rolls away. King chases after the ball and picks it up, accidentally bumping into Tarak's butt.'']

'''King:''' Tarak, I found them!

[''The crow phone flies away. Tarak looks back at King with a shocked look on his face.'']

'''King:''' Is... something wrong?

'''Tarak:''' Uh, our little game must wait. The time has come to celebrate your... uh... Induction into the Titan Trappers! Come!

[''Tarak walks out of the room. King throws the glove and ball aside and runs after him.'']

[''Cut to outside somewhere on the island. Multiple King-like demons have gathered in front of a platform. Bill, Tarak, King, and two other demons stand on the stage. Cut to some demons banging on the ground with sticks. Cut to some demons putting a coat on King then back away.'']

'''King:''' You don't have to go all out like this. I- I'm fine doing a small thing. Family and friends kinda thing.

'''Tarak:''' Your presence is ''very'' special to us, King. Now, we can release the Grand Huntsman from his prison and be granted power and glory!

[''The audience cheers.'']

'''Tarak:''' In the [''ignites a torch''] ashes of your old life, your destiny awaits. Carry this torch to the tablet and set it aflame.

[''King takes over the torch from Tarak, then looks to his right at the tablet. He walks up to the tablet, hesitating for a bit, then sets it on fire. Immediately after that, the Collector's laughter can be heard, as a bright flash reflects in King's eyes before fading away.'']

'''King:''' D- Did you hear that?

'''Tarak:''' The connection has been made. And now we can summon him.

'''Bill:''' Ah, you're taking too long!

[''Bill rushes forward can covers King's head with a piece of cloth.'']

'''Bill:''' Don't worry, child. We're almost done.

[''As he speaks, he walks up behind King, then takes out a dagger and raises it above King's head.'']

'''King:''' Then we get to play catch, right?

[''Cut to a view from below the platform. Bill is still holding the dagger above King's head.'']

'''Tarak:''' Uh, did you pull something, Bill?

'''Bill:''' [''trembles''] I can't move! Wh- wh- whoa! Wh- wh- who- [''screams'']

[''Bill is suddenly lifted up by an unseen force and thrown aside.'']

'''King:''' Weh? Wha- what's happening?

[''A light ball appears above King's head, then gives out a bright flash. After the light fades away, King is gone from the stage. The crowd gasps.'']

'''Tarak:''' Is this the power of a Titan?

'''Bill:''' No, you bonehead!

[''Everyone turns around to look at Bill.'']

'''Bill:''' It's that girl and her ungodly sock monster!

[''Cut to somewhere on the island. Luz and Hooty take a deep breath and cancel out the [[Invisibility|invisibility]] glyph. They then lean back on a rock, panting.'']

'''Luz:''' King, [''lifts King up; his cloth falls off''] I'm so glad you're okay!

'''King:''' [''angrily''] What're you talking about? We were just about to play catch!

'''Hooty:''' [''angrily''] Hey! Luz just saved your life!

'''King:''' NYEH!

[''King frees himself form Luz's grasp and jumps to the ground.'']

'''King:''' These guys wouldn't hurt me. They ''get'' me! They know what it's like to be left behind.

'''Luz:''' King, if this is about your dad-

'''King:''' No! I mean, yeah, but it's ''you'' too, Luz!

[''Luz is taken aback by what King said.'']

'''King:''' You'll eventually go back to the [[Human Realm]], I know how it works. I've read your [[Azura]] [[The Good Witch Azura|books]]. You even promised your [[Camila Noceda|mom]]. I just thought I had to... prepare for a world without you in it.

'''Luz:''' But they won't help. King, you're not one of them.

'''King:''' Then what am I?!

'''Luz:''' You're... you're a Titan, King.

[''King becomes greatly shocked at what he just heard.'']

'''Tarak:''' Hark!

[''King looks to his left. Cut to Tarak standing nearby with a bunch of Titan Trappers behind him.'']

'''Tarak:''' Tis the wretched spawn of-

[''Bill emerges from behind Tarak and points at King.'']

'''Bill:''' Shut up and get that Titan!

[''Tarak immediately forms a [[Spell Circle|spell circle]] and fires shots at Luz, King and Hooty.'']

'''Luz:''' Come on, King!

[''Luz immediately picks King up and runs away as Hooty swings wildly behind her. Cut to a view from above showing the Titan Trappers chasing after the trio. Hooty swings his body to shield Luz and King from the attack. A demon draws a spell circle and uses magic to snatch King off Luz's shoulder, bringing him over to them.'']

'''King:''' Uh! Ah!

'''Luz:''' King! KING!

[''Luz chases after King, but he floats higher and out of her reach. Luz throws a [[Light Glyph|light glyph]] at the demon and hits him in the face, creating a bright flash which temporarily blinds him. Without magic holding him mid-air, King immediately starts falling down as he screams. He then takes off his cape and uses it as a parachute, slowing down his fall. Cut to some Titan Trappers firing shots with spell circles while others throw bolases at Luz and Hooty.'']

'''Luz:''' I gotcha! Ah! 

[''Luz tries to catch King, but is immediately attacked by shots fired by the Titan Trappers. Hooty shields Luz from the attack, then stretches upwards to divert their atention. He manages to evade some shots, but accidentally gets tied up by one of the bolas. He is then hit by multiple shots and falls to the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' Hooty!

[''Luz runs up to try and untangle the rope.'']

'''Hooty:''' Tell Lulu... how brave I was!

[''Tarak walks up to the duo and ignites a blue fire on his palm, intending to finish them off. Luz and Hooty looks up at him with a frightened expression. Behind them, King lands on the ground, then hops over the duo and pounces on Tarak, banging on his skull with his fists.'']

'''King:''' Stop fighting! I'm one of you guys!

[''Tarak grabs King and throws him to the ground, but King accidentally pulls off Tarak's skull. He notices this, gasps and looks back at Tarak. Cut to Tarak straightening up his body, and is revealed to be a [[Witch|witch]].'']

'''Tarak:''' You were never one of us. My brothers and sisters, a new hunt begins today!

[''Everyone around proceeds to take off their skulls. Bill pushes Tarak aside and jumps in front of King.'']

'''Bill:''' With this gift, the Grand Huntsman will return, and I shall ride cloaked in glory above others! [''evil laughter'']

[''Bill's words make everyone around look at each other uncertainly.'']

'''Tarak:''' You mean, "we", right? [''he takes out a spear and steps forward with an angry look on his face''] You promised the Huntsman will grant all of us glory.

'''Bill:''' Uh...

'''Hooty:''' Are Titans even evil?

'''Luz:''' How much have you been making up?

'''Bill:''' Uh... uh, don't let the girl fool you! I- I- I'm totally not lying. [''takes off his skull''] Hand me my spear!

[''All the Titan Trappers give him a distrustful look.'']

'''Bill:''' Whatever. Just gimme that thing!

[''As he speaks, Bill jumps up to snatch the spear away from Tarak's hand. Before he can harm King, Hooty barges out from the ground below him and sends him flying upwards. The bolas wrapped around Hooty drops to the ground in front of Luz.''] 

'''Luz:''' Not today!

[''Luz picks up King, turns around and runs away. King accidentally drops Tarak's skull to the ground. Cut to two Titan Trappers helping Bill up.'']

'''Bill:''' Get off me. And get that Titan!

[''Cut to the trio running towards the platform where they arrived from, with the Titan Trappers chasing after them.'']

'''Luz:''' Time to go home!

[''Luz slams the rock from King's letter into the hole, reactivating the portal which pulls them upwards as the Titan Trappers watch on. Cut to them coming out from the other end, but they fall from a great height as Luz screams.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hoooooot!

[''Hooty extends his body and proceeds to wrap himself around the large finger nearby, successfully slowing down their fall and letting Luz and King land gently on the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' We can't let them get through. We have to destroy this thing!

[''Cut to the other side where a crowd of Titan Trappers run towards the platform and stop there. Cut back to Luz, King and Hooty.'']

'''King:''' [''squints''] Then step back.

[''King takes a few steps forward, takes a few deep breaths, then lets out a loud sonic scream. The sound waves create some cracks on the finger structure, causing the entire thing to come tumbling down. The portal starts shrinking as Luz picks up King and turns away, trying to shield him. Hooty then proceeds to wrap himself around the duo to protect them. The portal then explodes, creating a powerful blast which brings up a massive amount of dust and rocks the water in the ocean. The trio is then covered by a thick layer of dust brought upon by the blast. A while later, Hooty pokes his head out from the pile of dust.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hoot!

[''Hooty shakes off the dust and unwraps himself from the duo. They all look up in shock. Where the finger was at, there is now only a pile of rocks left, which is still smoking. King looks up at the rocks sadly. Luz and Hooty turn their heads to look at King, who then walks up to Luz and hugs her leg.'']

'''King:''' [''crying tone''] I wanna go home.

[''King starts tearing up. Luz and Hooty look down at him with a sad expression on their faces. Scene changes to show Salty's boat sailing on the sea. On the crow's nest, King looks down at the symbol on the metal plate of his collar. When he looks up, he sees the Boiling Isles' Titan's corpse in front of him.'']

'''King:''' [''hesitantly''] Um... hi.

'''Luz:''' King!

[''King looks down. Below, Salty is cooking something on a stove. Hooty is eating what appears to be a bacon strip from his plate. Luz holds up a plate with two eggs and a bacon strip and looks up at King.'']

'''Luz:''' You want breakfast?

[''King stands up, gives the Titan's corpse another glance, then turns around and walks away sadly.'']

[''Scene cuts to multiple Coven Scouts running up and surrounding something, each with a spell circle ready at their fingertip.'']

'''Guard captain:''' [''steps forward; to the crow phone''] We have them surrounded.

'''Kikimora:''' [''on the phone''] Good. Arrest anyone inside. For the Emperor.

[''Scene changes to show that the Coven Scouts have surrounded the Owl House.'']

'''Coven Scouts:''' For the Emperor!

[''Scene opens with [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] inside her room at the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]]. She is sitting on the floor going through different books. She then notices her [[Echo Mouse|echo mouse]] running on a running wheel.'']

'''Luz:''' [''sighs''] You and me both, buddy. I can't figure out what I messed up when I made that ding-danged door.

[''Luz is suddenly distracted by a clinking sound. Downstairs, [[Hooty]] is throwing a party.'']

'''Hooty:''' It is so nice to be surrounded by all of Lulu's dearest friends! 

[''Scene cuts to the living room showing the attendees of the party. They include an unknown woman, [[Gwendolyn Clawthorne|Gwendolyn]], [[Morton]], [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]], [[Steve]] (in casual-ish attire), [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]], [[King]], and [[Tinella Nosa]].'']

'''Steve:''' Yeah! All hail Lulu!

'''Hooty:''' We're here to celebrate the new assistant curator of the Supernatural Museum of History. [''lifts up his wine cup''] Here's to you, Lulu!

'''All to Lilith:''' Cheers!

[''Lilith accepts everyone's toast with an awkward smile on her face.'']

[''Luz comes down to the living room wearing a party hat and notices everyone around chatting. She approaches Hooty.'']

'''Luz:''' Hooty! Did I miss the toast?

'''Hooty:''' Yes, but not the "app-pellet-tizers". 

[''Hooty shows Luz a plate with some owl pellets on it. One of them is still moving and screaming.'']

'''Hooty:''' You want a- There's an extra one. I'm working on it.

[''Hooty attempts to cough out another owl pellet.'']

'''Luz:''' No, no, no! That's okay. Uh, where's Lilith? We want to congratulate her.

[''Luz lift up her hat to show her Echo Mouse hidden in it. Suddenly, a whip appears, grabs one of Hooty's "app-pellet-tizers" and brings it outside. The unknown woman catches the falling "app-pellet-tizer" with her hand.'']

'''Woman:''' Oh, I wish I could stay longer, but I must be off on my next adventure. [''throws away the "app-pellet-tizer'']

[''Luz peeks outside the door and sees Lilith approaching the unknown woman.'']

'''Woman:''' It's such a delight to see my little bookworm back in the historical world after all these years.

'''Lilith:''' Uh, thank you, Flora, but it's just a small job. Only an assistant. I'm surprised you even heard about this.

'''Flora:''' The [[Emperor Belos|Emperor]] wanted to make sure you weren't getting into any trouble. And to clear out your office. I left a box of your knick-knacks inside. Wish you took more from my tutelage, dear. History's supposed to be exciting after all!

[''Flora uses her whip to catch a flying [[griffin]] and drags it down to the ground. She then jumps onto the Griffin's back and whips it, flying away with it.'']

'''Luz:''' Who was that?

'''Lilith:''' [[Flora D'splora]]. Bad-girl historian, celebrity, and my formal mentor in the [[Emperor's Coven]].

'''Luz:''' I have questions about that name.

'''Lilith:''' And I have questions about MY LIFE!!! All I ever got to do was desk work, while she goofed off riding wild snake horses and-

'''Luz:''' [''eyes light up''] Snorses!

'''Lilith:''' -And, and eating mummy jerky! Well, I can be just as exciting as Flora. I'll come up with an exhibit that'll knock the [[The Titan|Titan's]] socks off!

[''Lilith storms into the house. Luz shouts after her.'']

'''Luz:''' Congratulations on your new job!

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|OPENING THEME,]] but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.''']

[''Scene starts with echo mouse's playback on Philip's [[Philip Wittebane's diary|diary]] entry.'']

'''Philip:''' After careful analysis during this [[Deadwardian Era]], I believe the current [[Human|human]] year is 1660. Or is it '70? The years are flashing by, but it will all be worth it. I've gathered all the [[Portal|portal]] ingredients including [[Titan's Blood]]. All that's left is to seek out The [[Collector]], and he will tell me what I need to complete my mission. But first, my companions and I must face-

[''The playback is cut off before Philip can finish. Back at the living room, Luz lies on the couch staring at the ceiling, where the playback was just shown. The Echo Mouse goes to sleep.'']

'''King:''' The Collector. I've never heard that name.

'''Eda:''' Me neither. What kind of jerk puts "The" in front of their name anyway?[''picks up trash and put them into trash bag'']

'''Luz:''' But The Collector may know how to make a real portal door. He may know why mine is so unstable. I just... I messed up so bad last time. I need to do better.

'''Eda:''' Luz, I've got leg hair older than you. This Philip guy worked on his door for years. Try not to beat yourself up too much.

'''Luz:''' Yeah. [''dejectedly''] I just with I could go back in time and talk to him.

[''A sudden realization hit Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda! Is time magic a thing?

'''Eda:''' Not really, but...

[''Eda takes off a book from the shelf titled "History's Top 10 Plot Holes".'']

'''Eda:''' Back in the day, [''opens the book''] I was a bit of an urban-legend junkie. Twig Foot, Lenderman, possums...

'''Luz:''' Those are real.

'''Eda:''' [''snorts''] Yeah sure, kid. Anyway, there are stories about these things called [[Time pool|Time pools]]. Mythical puddles that act as windows into the past, but they're never in the same spot twice. Me and Lily used to search for them. She'd say I forced her into it, but I think she had more fun than me.

'''Luz:''' Lilith! Of course! Thanks Eda!

[''Luz snatches the book off Eda's hands and runs off to find Lilith.'']

[''At the kitchen, Lilith is busy making model balusters.'']

'''Luz:''' Lilith!

[''Luz suddenly emerges from behind Lilith and calls out her name, startling her.'']

'''Luz:''' I see you're dealing with all this.

'''Lilith:''' I'm plotting out my first exhibit for the museum. It's almost as if the Emperor wanted Flora to tick me off. Well, I'll show her that she's not the only bad-girl historian in town. I'm thinking...

[''Lilith takes out a board with information of Deadwardian balusters on it.'']

'''Lilith:''' "The Architecture History behind Deadwardian Balusters".

[''Luz looks at the board and smiles awkwardly. A sudden realization hits Lilith.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''dejectedly''] This won't work, will it?

'''Luz:''' Don't let Flora get you down! I even started calling you "Cool Aunt Lilith" in my journal. 

'''Lilith:''' [''flattered''] Uh, oh, really?

'''Luz:''' You can be a bad-girl historian. And I know how.

[''Luz shows Lilith the Time Pool section in Eda's book.'']

'''Lilith:''' Oh, I remember these! "In the Premysteric Era, it's theorized that coagulated Titan Blood mixed with the magical algae of the Boiling Sea created temporary holes in time."

'''Luz:''' Time magic, baby! You can make an exciting exhibit on Time Pools, and maybe I can get information on how Philip made the portal door!

'''Lilith:''' I... did cobble together a device to find these with Eda. It should be in the box Flora returned to me. But it was faulty. It needed more power than I could ever give it.

[''Luz suddenly realizes something.'']

'''Luz:''' Stay right there!

[''Luz runs off to do something. Lilith and her [[Palisman|palisman]] look at each other and the latter shrugs. Something crashes to the ground, making a loud noise. Luz runs back to the kitchen holding [[Amity Blight|Amity's]] glove.'']

'''Luz:''' Would Titan Blood do the trick?

[''Lilith looks at her board.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''determined''] Let's do it!

[''With the device now working, Luz and Lilith set off to find the Time Pools. At sunset, Luz climbs up a tree and holds up the device, sending energy to its reading instrument. At night, Lilith's palisman flies back with a piece of leaf with an unknown substance on it. Eventually, on the second day, Lilith manages to narrow down the location.'']

'''Lilith:''' Don't worry, Luz, we're getting closer. I can feel it.

[''Lilith swings her knife into a tree beside her. She takes a piece of tree bark and drops it into her device's test tube to test it.'']

'''Lilith:''' Ha! Exactly what I thought. These are wrinkling oaks.

'''Luz:''' [''squints''] They don't look very wrinkly.

'''Lilith:''' That's because something's keeping them locked in time. So, accounting for local plaque patterns, the quake in the '30s, and the switch from boiling units to the empirical system, the time pool should be... [''pushes aside two leaves''] here!

[''Lilith finds the location to be a beach and becomes disappointed.'']

'''Lilith:''' But... I triple-checked all my calculations. My equipment is first-rate!

[''Lilith suddenly trips on something and almost falls down.'']

'''Lilith:''' Stupid rock! [''kicks sand'']

[''Luz wanders around and kicks a stone, which promptly disappears into an invisible pool, grabbing her attention. She kneels down to check.'']

'''Lilith:''' Maybe the Titan Blood was too dry? Is it not algae-blooming season?

[''Luz pokes her head into the pool, and finds herself staring at the same spot with a completely different surrounding from Prehistoric Era. A beast walks in front of Luz, stops, and screeches.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''at the present''] Was it my tools? Are they broken? [''takes off glasses and sniffs''] Am... [''stares at her reflection on the lenses''] I... broken?

[''Luz takes her head out from the pool and coughs. She turns her head back to Lilith.'']

'''Luz:''' Lilith! You did it. [''holds up an ammonite''] You found the time pools!

[''Lilith gasps, turns back towards her reflection and points at it.'']

'''Lilith:''' In your face!

[''Scene cuts back to the same era Luz just saw. The beast from before walks towards the beach. It then stops, scratches itself, yawns, and lie down, turning itself into stone. After witnessing this, Lilith holds her breath and pulls herself back into the present.'']

'''Lilith:''' A [[Stonesleeper]] from the [[Hecktaceous Period]]. [''turns to Luz''] Did you know that they have a ticklish spot behind their ears?

[''Luz has her back facing Lilith. She kneels down and pokes at the sand.'']

'''Lilith:''' Luz, are you listening?

'''Luz:''' Come on, time pools. Mama needs to commune with the dead. 

[''Luz takes a deep breath and pokes her head into the sand. She finds herself in another unfamiliar era. She hears someone talking and looks towards the source of sound. 3 people wearing Medieval-style armor are sitting around a campfire.'']

'''Person 1:''' Tonight I shall revel so hard, I shan't stand any longer!

'''Person 2:''' I shall revel mineself to death!

[''Luz pulls her head out back to the present and looks towards the place where the trio were sitting. The skeleton of Person 2 lies there, giving two thumbs ups.'']

'''Lilith:''' No wonder no one's found these before. They're completely hidden from sight.

[''Lilith pokes her head into another Time Pool, which happens to lead to the moment from not so long ago, when her and Luz just arrived at the beach. Her past self accidentally trips on her current self's head and almost falls down.'']

'''Past Lilith:''' Stupid rock! [''kicks sand'']

[''Lilith pulls her head back to the present and rubs her forehead, which was kicked by her past self. Behind her, Luz pokes her head into another Time Pool. She turns around and finds herself staring at [[Bonesborough]] from an unknown era.'']

'''Luz:''' Wow. It's a little Babysborough! 

[''Luz notices someone walking nearby and calls out to her.'']

'''Luz:''' Yo! What era is it?

'''Woman:''' 'Tis the Deadwardian Era. What ye be doing in the sand? Be ye a crab maiden?

'''Luz:''' Philip's time! 

[''Luz pulls her head back. Suddenly, she pokes back out again.'']

'''Luz:''' And, yes! I am a crab maiden.

[''Luz pulls her head back to the present and calls out to Lilith.'']

'''Luz:''' Lilith!

'''Lilith:''' Luz! Look.

[''Lilith pulls her head out of a Time Pool with some barnacles on top of it.'']

'''Lilith:''' There are the oldest barnacles I've ever had on my head.

'''Luz:''' I found it! I found Philip's time!

'''Lilith:''' [''walks towards Luz''] Ooh, incredible! This will be a truly unprecedented exploration. N-Now, before we dive in, we must remember if the tide comes in we could be trapped, paradoxes will be a danger, and don't get me started on the bloody fly effect, uh... [''clears throat''] But a bad-girl historian like myself is all about taking risks. So... let's boogie down to History Town. 

[''Lilith dances, sings and does finger guns.'']

'''Luz:''' [''mumbles awkwardly''] She really is Cool Aunt Lilith.

[''Back at the Owl House, someone knocks on the door. Eda goes up to open it and finds Gwendolyn standing outside.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Hello, witchlet.

'''Eda:''' Hey, Ma. Why are you still in town? Forget something from yesterday?

'''Gwendolyn:''' Your [[Dell Clawthorne|father]] wanted to swing by.

'''Eda:''' [''taken aback''] Well, tell him I'm busy.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Maybe you could tell him yourself? Uh, he's just outside.

'''King:''' [''gasps''] I get to meet my grandpa? 

'''Gwendolyn:''' Yes. You know, the Clawthorne clan was once known for their Palismen-making skills. And Dell? Whoo, he was the best of them all.

'''King:''' Cool!

[''Eda notices Dell's shadow approaching outside and becomes panicked.'']

[''Back at the Deadwardian era, Luz and Lilith comes out from the Time Pool. Lilith steals a straw hat from a pile of laundry nearby while Luz takes off the helmet from Medieval Era Person 2's skeleton. They then arrive at the outskirts of Bonesborough and prepares to go in.'']

'''Lilith:''' Now, Luz. We are technically in the [[The Savage Ages|Savage Ages]], way before Belos banished wild [[Magic|magic]]. These denizens may be dangerous!

[''The duo heads into town and bumps into a [[Demon|demon]]. Expecting an attack, Luz gets into a defensive posture.'']

'''Demon:''' [''tips hat''] Good tidings, kind [[Witch|witches]].

[''Lilith and Luz are surprised by that. Inside Bonesborough, the surrounding appears to be much more peaceful and harmonious than they imagined. Residents can be seen playing musical instruments, helping each other out, and summoning [[Abomination|Abominations]] at will. The duo looks at everything with amazement.'']

'''Luz:''' This doesn't look dangerous. This looks awesome! Why did Belos want to banish wild magic again?

'''Lilith:''' Well, the Titan supposedly doesn't like it. [''notices something''] Oh, my gosh! look at this thatch work. Each segment looped by hand! [''chortles (?) and writes something down'']

[''Luz walks away. Lilith suddenly stops writing.'']

'''Lilith:''' But I bet Flora would scoff at it. [''becomes upset and closes the notebook'']

[''Luz approaches a demon sitting on a bench feeding birds. She shows him a drawing of Philip Wittebane's silhouette.'']

'''Luz:''' Excuse me. Have you seen a human around? Round ears, super smart. Honestly, he's probably a celebrity around here.

'''Demon:''' [''shrugs''] Uh-uh.

[''Scene cuts to Luz in front of a stand showing the vendor Philip's drawing.'']

'''Man:''' [''shrugs''] Uh-uh.

[''Luz shows the drawing to a passer-by.'']

'''Woman:''' [''shakes head''] Mm-mmm.

[''Luz shows the drawing to another passer-by.'']

'''3-headed demon:''' Mmm... Nope.

[''Luz's face turns glum. Suddenly, both her and Lilith hear someone shouting nearby.'']

'''Unknown:''' Dance, human. Dance!

[''They peek out from behind a wall and see 2 demons gangling up on Philip Wittebane.'']

'''Philip:''' Give that back!

[''The demons throw Philip's diary at each other back and forth.'']

'''Philip:''' [''shakes head, exasperated''] I can't believe this. After the bonds of fellowship we forged-

'''Red Fang:''' Bonds? Ha! You still owe us. 

[''Red Fang gives Philip and hard push, causing him to fall to the ground.'']

'''Philip:''' When I accomplish my mission, I promise you, you'll have your [[Snail|snails]].

'''Green Fang:''' Listen to this. "With my new and bravest companion, Blue Fang, I set forth. His strength should make fast work of any task." [''passes the book to Red Fang'']

'''Red Fang:''' His pretty little words should make pretty good kindling. 

[''Red Fang ignites a fire with a [[Spell Circle|spell circle]] and attempts to burn the book. Philip gasps. An ice spike suddenly pops up and knocks the diary off Red Fang's hand, surprising the demons. Luz steps forward, grabbing their attention.'']

'''Luz:''' [''points''] That doesn't belong to you.

[''Back at the Owl House at present day. Gwendolyn is outside Eda's room knocking on her door.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Witchlet? Aren't you going to say hello to your father? It's been-

[''Inside the room, Eda is busy packing [[Elixir|elixirs]] into Luz's bag.'']

'''Eda:''' Years! Yep, been years, I know. I'm, uh, just sharpening my tooth. Don't want Pops to see me looking all ''blech'', you feel?

'''King:''' [''puzzled''] What's with you? Why are you so terrified of seeing your dad?

'''Eda:''' It's not like I'm scared of him. I just haven't seen him since I ruined his- I mean since the [[Owl Beast]] ruined his- [''sighs in exasperation''] I'm just not ready, okay? Now move it. I gotta scram.

[''Eda attempts to flee via the balcony, but [[Hawksley]] lands and blocks her path. Eda cries out in surprise and shuts the curtains. She then attempts to escape via the round stained glass window, but finds Hooty waiting outside.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hiya, Eda! Your pops is such a nice guy. Say, how did he get that scar on his-

[''Eda slams the window shut before Hooty can finish his sentence.'']

'''King:''' [''laughs''] Hey, Eda, look! [''holds up Lilith's old dress and a mop''] "Dear sister, join the Emperor's Coven and together, we can become gods!"

[''An idea pops up inside Eda's mind. She smirks.'']

'''Eda:''' Hmm.

[''Back at the Deadwardian Era in Bonesborough. Luz stands still confronting the 2 demons who were gangling up on Philip. Red Fang attempts to attack Luz, but is stopped by Green Fang.'']

'''Green Fang:''' Don't waste your time on the kid. We should keep looking.

'''Red Fang:''' [''to Luz''] Ask your friend there what happened to our brother, Blue Fang, and his Palisman.

[''Green Fang kicks on Philip's scattered journals and walks away with Red Fang. Philip starts picking up the journals, but suddenly yelps in pain and holds on to his right leg. He then continues to pick up the journals, and Luz helps him pick up some of it. She looks at one of the pages, which shows a drawing of [[Eclipse Lake (location)|Eclipse Lake]].'']

'''Luz:''' So he's already gotten to the Titan Blood. [''notices drawing of an unknown person''] Who's that?

'''Philip:''' Hmph! [''snatches away the journals from Luz's hands''] That's private.

'''Luz:''' You're Philip Wittebane, aren't you? The human?

'''Philip:''' Here to gawk? I may not have a bile sac, but I do have dignity. [''turns away'']

'''Luz:''' Wait! I've heard of your exploits, and I know what it's like to be far from home. Can we talk?

'''Philip:''' [''stares at Luz, then squints''] No.

[''Philip starts to walk away limping.'']

'''Luz:''' Wait! I can give you snails! I can make you crutches! Um, uh... I can help you find the Collector!

[''Philip stops and glances at Luz sideways. Scene cuts to Philip, Luz and Lilith walking through a forest.'']

'''Philip:''' So, Luzura. You and your Aunt Dirtrude started travelling together after the Toe-gres attacked your castle and covered it with an impenetrable mist?

'''Luz:''' Yes. And that's why we, too, seek The Collector. We need him to tell us how to clear the mists so we can return home. Snap, snap, snap.

[''Philip brings Luz and Lilith into a cave.'']

'''Philip:''' Now... anyone bring a torch?

[''Luz shows Philip a [[Light Glyph|light glyph]] and activates it, turning it into a light ball.'']

'''Philip:''' Astounding! I thought I was the only one who used picto-glyphs.  

'''Luz:''' You use glyphs too? [''passes Philip a light glyph'']

'''Philip:''' How else could I have survived here? Plant growth, ice, fire... Took years to find them. [''sketches the Light glyph pattern into his diary''] Almost as if the world wanted to hide them from me. I even found one in a snowflake. 

'''Luz:''' My dude, me too!

'''Philip:''' A warrior and a scholar. Truly impressive.

[''Philip walks away.'']

'''Luz:''' [''excitedly''] Ah! I can't believe I taught Philip something new! [''squeals in excitement'']

[''Luz walks away to follow Philip. Lilith has a dubious look on her face.'']

[''Philip leads the duo deeper into the cave, activating Light glyphs along the way.'']

'''Philip:''' Line there, curve there... fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. 

[''Philip senses that Lilith is staring at him suspiciously. He looks back at Lilith and speaks.''] 

'''Philip:''' Your niece is very talented. I'm sure she takes after her aunt.

'''Lilith:''' [''flattered''] Oh. [''chuckles''] Maybe I... had a little something to do with it.

'''Philip:''' Now, I know a few tricks as well.

[''Philip puts up a light ball and starts to draw a large glyph combo on the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' What is this?

'''Philip:''' A shortcut... [''taps on the Glyph combo''] to The Collector. 

[''The glyph combo starts to flash brightly. The screen turns white.'']

[''Back at the Owl House at present day. Gwendolyn is still standing outside Eda's room.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Really, Eda? [''knocks on the door''] You won't be able to run away this time.

[''Eda suddenly flings the door open. She is wearing Lilith's old dress and a wig atop her head, disguising herself as Lilith.'']

'''Eda:''' Apologies, dearest mother. Dearest sister has flown the dearest coop. But worry not, for I, the perfect, prissy little Lily, shall find her for you.

[''Eda marches away. While walking, her hair starts to come out from beneath the wig.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''incredulously''] Does she seriously think I'm buying that?

'''King:''' Just let her have this.

[''At the backside of the Owl House, Eda flings the door open and escapes outside. She tears off Lilith's dress and takes off her wig.'']

'''Eda:''' [''laughs''] Not today, suckers!

[''Eda attempts to fly away on her [[Owl Staff]], but immediately stops and gasps when she notices something. Not far away, Dell is standing at the edge of cliff looking at sunset, with his back facing Eda. A yellow cardinal palisman perches on his shoulder.'']

'''Dell:''' [''glances to his right''] Am I too late again? [''glances ahead''] Well, fly safe, witchlet. Perhaps I'll catch you next time.

[''Dell's palismen glances towards Eda. After hesitating for a bit, Eda retracts [[Owlbert|Owlbert's]] wings.'']

'''Eda:''' Hi, dad.

[''Back at the Deadwardian Era. The bright light fades away. Luz and Lilith open their eyes and find themselves inside an ice cave. There is a tall double door at the end.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] Whoa. Where are we?

[''Philip doesn't reply and walks towards the door. Luz looks outside through a wide gap and gasps.'']

'''Luz:''' We're in the head of the Titan?!

'''Lilith:''' W-We're what??? But this is sacred ground!

'''Philip:''' I suppose that's why no one wanted to accompany me. [''limps towards the door''] But every legend told me that The Collector lies there. Behind that door. I just can't figure out the mechanisms to open it. If I weren't so frail...

[''Philip winces in pain and kneels down, clutching his right leg.'']

'''Luz:''' It's okay, we can help! Puzzles are in my blood, literally. My mom had to stop me from eating puzzles when I was a kid. You stay here and rest up.

'''Philip:''' Thank you for your kindness, crab maiden. [''puts a hand on Luz's shoulder''] Perhaps we were destined to meet.

[''Luz smiles at Philip. She then runs to Lilith, who is in front of the door trying to open it.'']

'''Lilith:''' This mechanism is unlike any I've seen before. It'll make a remarkable addition to my exhibit. It's just...

[''Lilith hesitates and appears to be contemplating something.'']

'''Luz:''' Come on, we can't stop now! We're getting everything we could have hoped for!

'''Lilith:''' That's just it. Look. Most of this puzzle has been solved already. [''glances towards Philip''] And Philip... 

[''Luz glances towards Philip too. He is sitting on the ground writing something.'']

'''Lilith:''' The confidence, the compliments. He says everything you want to hear. It feels... uncomfortably familiar.

'''Luz:''' Some of this is pretty weird. But it's the [[Boiling Isles]]! Everything's a little weird, right? Hey, why don't you keep working on this, and I'll go talk to Philip?

[''Luz walks towards Philip as Lilith continues trying to solve the puzzle. There is a blue fang and a palisman inside Philip's bag. Luz approaches Philip from behind and reads what he is writing in his diary.'']

'''Luz:''' "I single-handedly defeated the beast behind the door. Tragically, I could not save my companions."

[''Philip notices Luz behind him and stands up.'']

'''Luz:''' [''hesitantly''] Philip, why did you bring us here?

[''The ground shakes, accompanied by a loud sound. Luz looks back towards the door.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''waves''] Ah! I did it! I solved the puzzle!

[''Behind her, the doors open inwards.'']

'''Philip:''' I needed a sacrifice.

'''Lilith:''' What'd he say?

[''A claw suddenly emerges from inside and grabs Lilith. She screams while being dragged into darkness.''] 

'''Luz:''' Lilith!

'''Philip:''' Well, with the beast distracted, I can finally get through those doors.

'''Luz:''' [''angrily''] You tricked us!

'''Philip:''' It was-

'''Luz:''' Destiny? Balderdash.

'''Philip:''' [''laughs''] I was going to say, "inevitable". You two were easier to trick than Blue Fang. Hopefully you and Aunt Dirtrude can last longer.

[''From inside the room comes Lilith's terrified screams. Luz rushes inside and finds a beast grasping Lilith in its claws. It notices Luz and screeches at her.'']

'''Luz:''' Lilith!

[''The beast rushes towards Luz. She immediately activates an [[Ice Glyph|Ice glyph]] and creates an ice trail. The beast slips on the ice and falls down, loosening its grip. Lilith jumps off. Luz grabs her hand and they run away together. Meanwhile, Philip walks up to a platform and starts digging. The beast stands up and chases after Lilith and Luz.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''angrily at Philip''] Hey! That better be your own grave you're digging!

[''Luz activates [[Fire Glyph|Fire glyphs]] to create flames, temporarily blinding the beast. Meanwhile, Philip's shovel hit something. He grins and picks up the object.'']

'''Philip:''' Found you.

[''He looks at his reflection in the object, which is a mirror with a crescent moon drawing on it. Meanwhile, Luz and Lilith try to hide from the beast behind a pillar.'']

'''Luz:''' I know you want to get home, but nothing is worth hurting people!

[''The beast swings its tail at the duo and breaks the pillar, barely missing them. It continues chasing after the duo.'']

'''Philip:''' Oh, I disagree. It was nice making a cat's-paw out of you. [''draws the glyph combo on ground''] Good luck with your... crab castle... or... whatever.  You witches come up with the worst lies.

[''Philip taps on the glyph combo. It flashes and teleports him away. The beast is distracted by the flash and rushes towards it. Luz grabs Lilith by the hand and runs towards a pillar, hiding behind it.'']

'''Lilith:''' Is this how it all ends for Lilith Clawthorne? Her body lost to time?

'''Luz:''' You were right about that jerkweed. I'm so sorry, Lilith.

'''Lilith:''' Oh, your humility before death truly heartens me.

'''Luz:''' Yeah, I should have listened to you.

[''Luz suddenly realizes something.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] Wait... I did listen to you!

'''Lilith:''' Uh...

[''Luz runs off.'']

'''Lilith:''' LUZ!!!

[''Luz runs towards the beast. The beast notices Luz and turns its head towards her. Luz continues to run towards it.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''nervously''] Eda's gonna kill me, Eda's gonna kill me, Eda's gonna kill me!!!

[''Lilith covers her eyes. Suddenly, she hears a thud. She takes a peek and sees Luz scratching the beast behind its ear.'']

'''Luz:''' It's one of those Stonesleepers from the Hecktaceous period! It must have been hibernating in here for ages. [''continues scratching''] Aw. Do you like that, boy? Aw, you're a good boy.

'''Lilith:''' [''sheds a tear, gladly''] You were listening.

[''Scene cuts to Philip walking on a trail inside a forest. He is writing something down on his diary.'']

'''Philip:''' "And so I doggedly limped home, but I had my prize." [''puts his diary into his bag and takes out the mirror''] How to describe you? Oval? Oblong? A round boy?

[''Philip hears some loud thuds behind him. He turns around and sees the Stonesleeper from inside the cave. It screeches at him, causing him to gasp in shock. Luz and Lilith jump down from the Stonesleeper's back.'']

'''Luz:''' Tell me how that thing's gonna help you build a portal to the [[Human Realm]].

[''Philip looks down at his mirror.'']

'''Philip:''' Oh, no. [''puts the mirror into his bag''] I need this for something else.

'''Luz:''' No? [''furiously''] WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NO"?!

'''Philip:''' I mean, if it's information you want, perhaps we can make an exchange. I'll probably require another sacrifice sooner or later.  [''walks towards the duo''] If you or your aunt want to-

[''Lilith walks towards Philip and punches him square in the face, breaking his nose.'']

'''Philip:''' Ugh! Ah! [''angrily''] You hateable sorcerers!

'''Lilith:''' [''angrily''] Stay mad. [''to Luz''] Come, Luzura. We're finished here.

[''Luz sneers while making hand gestures at Philip.'']

'''Luz:''' Cool aunt.

[''Luz climbs up to the Stonesleeper's back with Lilith. They ride off together, and the Stonesleeper accidentally kicks Philip in the head while walking off. Lilith notices that Luz is upset.'']

'''Lilith:''' You know, Luz, if some jerk like Philip can build a portal, then I'm sure you can too.

'''Luz:''' [''gladly''] Thanks. Hey, we have a little time before the tide comes in. You want to do something exciting?

[''Lilith looks at Luz with a puzzled expression. Scene cuts to the duo inside Bonesborough. Lilith is watching a craftsman making balusters.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''excitedly''] Balusters, Luz! Deadwardian balusters!

[''Lilith jots down the process inside her notebook. Behind her, Luz watches on gladly.'']

[''Back at present day. Eda is sitting with her dad at the cliff.'']

'''Eda:''' Sorry, I, uh, haven't been in touch. There's been a lot going on.

'''Dell:''' [''sighs''] You disappear from Bonesborough, you're fixing up my old tower, and then suddenly I see you on a wanted poster. And your mother tells me about the [[Petrification|petrification]]. I wish you'd let us help. But I do hear I have a grandson now.

'''Eda:''' [''chuckles''] Yep, King's a Clawthorne. He can be a handful, but-

'''Dell:''' It's been over 20 years, witchlet. I can't chase you anymore.

'''Eda:''' [''emotionally''] Then stop! I've ruined your life. Have you even been able to carve a new Palisman since I attacked you?

[''Dell lifts up his left hand, which trembles. Eda looks at it with a guilty expression, then looks away. Dell puts down his hand.'']

'''Eda:''' Stop trying to forgive me. [''stands up and walks away''] I don't deserve it.

[''Eda walks towards the Owl House looking guilty. Suddenly, Dell taps his hand on her shoulder, stopping her. Eda turns to look at him.'']

'''Dell:''' Don't worry, I'm not here to try that again.

[''Dell opens up his left palm, showing Eda something on it.'']

'''Eda:''' What... is that?

'''Dell:''' It's a palistrom seed. My Palisman-making days are over, but I've been helping the [[Bat Queen]] replenish her forests, so someone new can learn the trade.

'''Eda:''' [''jokingly''] Did you come all the way here just to brag?

'''Dell:''' Yes! But also to say, [''offers Eda the seed''] let the past stay in the past, witchlet. It's okay to move on. [''puts his hand on Eda's hand''] And give Owlbert my regards. [''walks away''] Carving him with you is one of my dearest memories.

[''Eda watches as Dell walks into the Owl House. Touched by his words, Eda smiles with tears in her eyes. Right then, behind her, Luz and Lilith arrive back while riding on Lilith's [[Raven Staff]].'']

'''Lilith:''' We got lucky today, Luz. Next time those Time Pools show up, they could be on the other side of the world.

'''Eda:''' [''turns and walks towards the duo''] Hey nerds! How was your nerd quest? You find that dead nerd?

'''Luz:''' Layin' it on a little thick there, Eda. But, yeah, we found Philip.

'''Eda:''' Whoa, seriously?

'''Luz:''' [''grumpily''] Yeah. He stunk.

'''Lilith:''' I punched him in the face.

'''Luz:''' Groovy, auntie.

[''Luz and Lilith grin while making finger guns at each other, much to Eda's annoyance.'']

'''Eda:''' Uh, you gu- you guys need to stop that.

[''Back in Deadwardian Era. Philip arrives at the cave where he lives in while grunting in pain. He trips on a head of a broken palisman and kicks in away forcefully with his right leg.'']

'''Philip:''' Those barbarians. Those, those... WITCHES!!!

[''Philip's voice echoes throughout the cave. He puts up some light balls. Suddenly, he grimaces in pain and rolls up his sleeve, revealing his swollen right arm with multiple glyphs on it. He staggers forward, kneels down, and grabs a Palisman from the ground. He breaks it in half, absorbing the essence into his eyes and nose. He then exhales deeply. When he speaks again, his voice overlaps with another voice, which sounds similar to Emperor Belos.'']

'''Philip/Belos:''' It doesn't matter. [''takes out the mirror and holds it up''] I just need to live long enough to see this through.

[''Philip wipes his hand on the mirror. It flashes and starts projecting an animation onto the wall.'']

'''Philip/Belos:''' [''grins sinisterly''] And you're going to help me, Collector.

[''The scene opens with an exterior shot of Blight Industries. Green smokes are coming out of the chimneys. We see a banner that says "PRIVATE SALE". Various hooded figures are seen entering the building. [[Edric Blight|Edric]] and [[Emira Blight|Emira]] are at the door. Edric puts a paper which says "HEX ME" on one of the hooded figure's back. The twins giggle. The scene then cuts to inside the factory. The hooded figures gather in front of a stage. Two hooded figures are standing on a stage. A light shines on them.'']

'''[[Odalia Blight|Odalia]]:''' [''grins''] Welcome, valued investors, to our annual [''takes off the hood''] Blight Industries private sale!

[''[[Alador Blight|Alador]] takes off the hood, but trips while doing it.'']

'''Odalia:''' If you're interested in reliable home security, we're here to help. [''whispers''] And, if you've got an enemy or two... Well, who are we to judge?  

[''The investors laugh. Odalia points at Alador.'']  

'''Odalia:''' This is my husband Alador Blight, the greatest abomination creator of the era. My name is Odalia, and as an oracle, I predict you'll love what we've got in store for you tonight. We are proud to present... the first glimpse of our crowning achievement.  

[''Odalia and Alador step aside, and up rises [[Amity Blight|Amity]] with a dry expression on her face, and next to her is a strange abomination-like creature in armor.'']

'''Odalia:''' The Abomaton Soldier!   

[''The investors clap. The scene cuts to the Abomaton pouring tea for Amity, doing her hair, and standing ready for a fight''.]   

'''Odalia:''' It will pour your tea! Help you keep up with the latest trends! And best of all, it will defend you against any unwanted visitors!  

[''Odalia touches her necklace which begins to glow; the jewel in Amity's necklace glows as well as she receives a telepathic message from it.'']  

'''Odalia:''' [''through her necklace''] Mama to Mittens, remember our deal: Make this look good, and we'll forgive your recent lackluster performance in school.

'''Amity:''' [''sighs''] Yes, mom.

[''Abomaton tries to pound Amity but misses.'']

'''Amity:''' [''monotonic''] Wow it's so fast and strong. Order now.        

[''Investors claps and cheers, Alador yawns. Abomaton grabs Amity.'']

'''Amity:''' [''monotonic''] Oh no, it's undefeatable. How will I ever escape?        

[''A picture falls from Amity's sleeve. A closeup reveals it's the one of her, Luz, Willow and Gus from Grom Night.'']

'''Amity:''' Huh?

[''Abomaton almost steps on the picture. Amity gasps, then casts spell circle to destroy Abomaton.'']

[''Crowd gasps, murmurs.'']

'''Random investor:''' That's awful.

[''Crowd turns and start leaving.'']

'''Odalia:''' Oh, of course, w-well that was but a beta test. We can't wait to see you all next week when reveal the uh... the finished product in all its glory!  

'''Odalia:''' [''turns towards Amity angrily''] Amity! You just lost us a lot of money! What's with you lately?!

[''Amity stares longingly at the picture.'']

'''Odalia:''' I see. Looks like our precious mittens has been getting... distracted. (''angry expression while thinking'')

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-''' 

[''[[Hooty]] smashes his face into a steel bucket 3 times.'']

'''[[Luz Noceda|Luz]]:''' [''speaks while activating glyphs''] Light in the darkness, a glittering bridge of ice, the mightiest tree in the forest! You can make all these, and more, with glyph magic! Welcome to day 3 of Luz's magic boot camp!  

[''Fire glyphs ignite on the ground. [[King]], sleeping near one, screams and runs away when it goes off. Scene cuts to [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] cheering and clapping while [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] is carving something into the desk she's using.'']  

'''Luz:''' Okay, we have covered every glyph I've learned up until now. So today, we'll learn something new.  

'''Lilith:''' Are we about to encounter a never-before-seen glyph?

'''Luz:''' Un... fortunately no. These 4 either came from nature or another witch's spell. I- I don't know where to find more.  

[''Lilith and Eda stares at each other.'']

'''Luz:''' In any case, today we're learning how to alter glyphs to do specific things!

'''Lilith:''' Miss teacher, did I do it right? [''Holds up a diagram of ice glyphs'']

'''Luz:''' Yeah! That's really good! [''Lilith fist pumps.''] Let's see how you're doing Eda.

[''Eda has carved the fire and ice glyphs overlapping together on the table.'']

'''Luz:''' I- I don't think that's such a good-

'''Eda:''' Double glyph combo, go!  

[''Eda slaps on the glyphs, they started flashing, then explode.'']

'''Eda:''' Oh dang, I was hoping more of an ice blast situation.

'''Luz:''' I know you're impatient to get your powers back, but try to master the basics before you start experimenting.

'''Eda:''' Ugh, you're as boring as Lilith.

'''Hooty:''' Toot toot! The Hexside train is a-coming! Chugga-chugga! [''grabs Luz by her collar'']

'''Luz:''' Uh okay, uh, King's in charge while I'm gone. Bye!

[''Hooty drags Luz away.'']

'''King:''' Hahah, power!

'''Eda:''' Yes! Teacher's gone! Hah, I wonder what other combos I can try.

'''Lilith:''' Teacher said we're supposed to master the basics before-

'''Eda:''' Basics are so basic. Now if we want to be powerful again we're gonna have to start thinking outside the box!

'''Lilith:''' If we want to be powerful again, we have to use glyphs perfectly! And we can only do that through "memorization", "repetition" and "following the rules".

'''Eda:''' Well, I'm more interested in "experimentation", "innovation" and uh, "laughing at tools!" Like you! Hah! [''walks away'']

'''Lilith:''' Ugh! [''stares down at King scratching himself'']

'''King:''' Weh? Yeah yeah, I'll deal with it. [''Walks off''] No one ever said power came with responsibility...  

[''Scene cuts to [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] exterior.'']

'''Luz:''' Okay, first day back after the petrification ceremony. Just be chill.  

[''Luz pushes door open, and is seen by [[Willow Park|Willow]] and [[Gus Porter|Gus]]. They run towards each other screaming happily.'']

'''Luz:''' [''tears up''] Oh my gosh!

[''The reunited trio hugs.'']

'''Gus:''' [''voice noticably deeper''] Luz! You're okay!

'''Luz:''' [''notices her friend is taller''] Whoa, Gus! Did I uh, miss a birthday or something?

'''Gus:''' [''shrugs''] Witch puberty.

'''Luz:''' I can't thank you guys enough for helping me and Eda at the conformatorium.

'''Gus:'''  That's cool, I just hope it helps Eda learn my name. She keeps calling me Goops.

'''Unknown student:''' Hey, Goops!

'''Gus:''' [''dejected''] It's already spreading...

'''Amity:''' Hey, Luz.

'''Luz:''' Amity!

'''Amity:''' In celebration of your return, I've brought you a homemade fairy pie.

'''Luz:''' Oh wow! That sounds so-

[''Scene cuts to the fairy pie, which is filled with still alive screaming fairies.'']

'''Luz:''' [''disgusted expression''] ...Gooood...

'''Amity:''' The ingredients are... very fresh. [''looks away blushing'']

'''Luz:''' Thank you. [''takes the pie''] You know, after everything that's happened, I'm just happy to return to some sense of normalcy.  

[''Sounds coming through school PA system.'']

'''[[Principal Bump]]:''' You can't just barge in here!

'''Odalia:''' Yes we can. We are the Parent Creature Association. Luz Noceda, Willow Park and Augustus Porter, report to Principal Bump's office now! And you too, Amity.

'''Amity:''' [''surprised''] Mom?!  

[''Scene cuts to Principal Bump's office. Odalia and Alador flank Principal Bump while the kids are sitting in front of them.'']

'''Odalia:''' The abomination situation, the destruction of detention, the rampage of grom. [''Willow and Gus have looks of worry on their faces, Luz looks confused and Amity angrily looks to the side, arms crossed.''] These are but a few of the incidents that have endangered Hexside students, including our daughter.  

[''Amity shoots her a glare.'']

'''Odalia:''' So, the PCA has decided to... [''notices Alador trying to touch [[Frewin]]'s moving tail and clears her throat'']

'''Alador:''' Oh, right. Um, these 3 are bad influences and must be executed.

[''Amity, Luz, Willow and Gus gasp.'']

'''Alador:''' Ahem, I mean expelled.

'''Luz and Gus:''' What?!

[''Amity stares at her mother furiously.'']

'''Odalia:''' [''through Amity's necklace''] Take this as a lesson mittens, a Blight always upholds their end of the deal.  

[''Amity gasps, then backs down with a dejected look.'']

'''Principal Bump:''' Sadly, I have no choice in the matter. Luz, Willow, Augustus, effective immediately you are no longer students of Hexside.

'''Luz:''' No! But us... Good... Amity, tell them!  

[''Odalia stares at Amity sternly while Amity looks at her with a defeated expression.'']

'''Odalia:''' Good. Now, you'll be taking double the classes to make up for lost time. Actually, I'm appalled that you're not in class right now. What are you thinking?

'''Amity:''' Right, sorry.

[''Odalia snaps her finger. 2 [[Hexside Guard|Hexside guards]] barge in and drag Willow, Gus and Luz away.'']

'''Gus:''' No, please! Wait wait wait...!!!

'''Luz:''' No wait, no! Amity! Amity!  

[''Odalia puts her hand on Amity's shoulder, while Amity glances back at Luz with a sad expression. The door closes.'']

[''Scene cuts to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics exterior.'']

'''Gus:''' It finally happened! Our memorable adventures caught up to us. Oh, my dad can't find out about this! (''picks up leaf'') I guess I'll have to start surviving off the land. 

[''Gus attemps to lick the leaf but couldn't bring himself to do it.'']

'''Gus:''' Ah! This is impossible! [''runs away crying'']

'''Willow:''' [''hugs a tree''] I guess this is goodbye. I'll water you one last time... with my tears! 

[''Luz groans. She notices Alador and Odalia coming out of school and descending down the steps.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey!

[''Odalia glances back.'']

'''Luz:''' How dare you mess with my friends' lives! What have we ever done to you?

'''Odalia:''' Luz, was it? Please, this isn't personal. I actually appreciate your tenacity. We're just trying to teach our daughter a valuable lesson in business.

'''Luz:''' How does this teach anything? We're still gonna be friends with her. I'm calling applesauce on this business baloney!

'''Odalia:''' Your human language is hard to understand, but I think I see your point. [''grabs and squeezes the butterfly Alador is chasing and releases it''] If you're interested in talking things through, I'm sure we can come to some sort of an agreement. [''hands Luz a Blight Industry business card'']

'''Gus:''' Gus chomp! [''munches on the card'']

'''Willow:''' Come on Luz, we can figure this out on our own.

'''Gus:''' [''spits out the card''] That's right, we'll get back into Hexside or die trying!

'''Willow:''' No one's dying.

'''Gus:''' Not with that attitude.

[''Willow and Gus turn and walk away.'']

'''Odalia:''' [''chuckles''] Yes well, when that doesn't work, you know where to find us. 

[''Odalia pushes Alador and they walk away together.'']

[''Scene cuts back to inside the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]]. Eda is seen making a card pyramid.'']

'''Eda:''' Okay, almost got it... Glyph pyramid! 

'''King:''' And what are you expecting this glyph pyramid to do?

'''Eda:''' It's supposed to prove that I'm the superior witch. Watch and learn.

[''Eda slaps on the card pyramid but fails to do anything impressive.'']

'''Eda:''' Ugh, okay let's think. Bile sacs have different spell phlegm sloshing around together. So why can't I mix these up too?! 

'''King:''' But those are disgusting liquids, these are symbols from the isles. Maybe there's a different way to combine them.

'''Eda:''' Hmmm... 

'''Hooty:''' [''outside''] Hootly-mootly! 

[''Eda looks outside the window.'']

[''Lilith creates an ice crown using glyph combo and puts it atop Hooty's head.'']

'''Hooty:''' Ohhh!!! 

[''Eda looks with a jealous expression.'']

[''Lilith makes 2 popsicles using glyph combos and offers Hooty one.'']

'''Hooty:''' Ohhh!!! [''munches on popsicle''] Ummm!!!

[''Lilith creates a swan Hooty ice sculpture using glyph combo.'']

'''Hooty:''' Whoahahaha!!! I bet even Eda couldn't do that! Wow! 

[''Eda growls angrily.'']

'''King:''' Maybe if you just learn the basics like Luz said-

'''Eda:''' I don't have time for basics. I'm on to something, and I'll prove it! 

[''Eda cracks her knuckles and starts drawing something on a notepad.'']

[''Scene cuts back to 3 posters showing that Willow, Luz and Gus are banned from Hexside.'']

'''Luz:''' Operation Change Bump's Mind. Let's go! 

[''Scene cuts to Principal Bump looking at pictures of him and the trio taken during grom night with a sad expression. Someone knocks on the window, there's a basket from the trio with a note pleading Principal Bump to un-expel them, a drawing of him, and a disfigured cake which is supposed to resemble his face. Principal Bump gets spooked by the cake and throws it down, hitting the trio on the head. The trio then try to enter by pretending to be Hexside teachers using Gus' illusion magic, but bump into Principal Bump and the teachers outside. Principal Bump breaks their illusion spell and the trio backs off. Principal Bump turns and walks away with tears. The trio then try to fly inside using Eda's staff, but backs off when Principal Bump points a crossbow at them.'' ]

'''Principal Bump:''' [''cries''] Life is just so dull without them! [''continues crying'']

[''The Hexside guards close the main door.'']

'''Gus:''' Ah, this is hopeless! Nothing is working!

'''Luz:''' Don't worry guys, as long as we stick together we'll think of something! 

[''A [[Crow Phone|crow phone]] crows and lands atop Willow's head.'']

'''Willow:''' Oh no.

'''[[Gilbert and Harvey Park|Harvey]]:''' [''from the phone''] Willow Park, did you get expelled?! 

[''Another crow phone lands atop Gus' head.'']

'''Perry:''' [''from the phone''] This is [[Perry Porter]] with breaking news. In light of recent events, Augustus Porter will be grounded for no less than a year.

[''Crow phone grabs Gus by his collar and starts flying up.'']

'''Gus:''' Help Luz! Let me go! No please, no!

'''Harvey:''' Just one? Willow's grounded for three at least!

[''The 2 crow phones grab Willow and Gus and fly away.'']

'''Willow:''' No, ah! Help, Luz! Help, Luz!!!

'''Gus:''' Luz! Save me!!!

[''Amity passes Luz from behind and accidentally drops her book. Luz hears it and turns back toward the source of sound. Amity notices Luz.'']

'''Amity:''' I'm uh... I'm sorry, I was a coward in there. But my mom-

'''Luz:''' Hey, I get it. You're scared of her, but I'm not, and I need you to take me her. She seemed open to talking things through.

'''Amity:''' No, no, Luz, you don't have to do that. 

'''Luz:''' Yes, I do. Willow and Gus don't deserve this. [''picks up Amity's book''] So, will you help me, please?

'''Amity:''' I... I can't. 

[''School bell rings.'']

'''Amity:''' I have to go. [''takes book from Luz, turns around and walks away'']

[''Luz turns around and walks away sadly, but accidentally steps on the business card thrown on the floor. She picks it up and notices the address written behind the card.'']

[''Scene cuts back to inside the Owl House.'']

'''King:''' Eda, wh- what the heck is that supposed to be?

'''Eda:''' I call it "the super glyph!"

'''King:''' More like, a stupid glyph.

'''Eda:''' Just you wait, this'll be a killer combo. Lesser glyphs will shrink in fear.

[''Eda taps on the glyph and it turns into an ice cube.'']

'''Eda:''' Hah! It didn't blow up! 

[''The ice cube sparkles and turns into a blob of ice which looks like a turtle shell with spikes.'']

'''King:''' Uh, i- is it supposed to do that?

[''The ice blob suddenly expands, causing Eda and King to yelp in surprise and run away. It continues to expand, trapping and freezing various objects inside it.'']

'''Eda:''' Uh-huh...

[''Scene cuts to outside [[Blight Manor]]. Luz picks some flowers from beside the front door, then walks up and knocks on the door.'']

'''Luz:''' Hello Mrs. Blight, I-

[''An [[Abomination|abomination]] butler opens the door and grunts.'']

'''Luz:''' Ooh.

[''The abomination butler leads Luz into the living room while holding a tray with teacup and teapot on it.'']

'''Luz:''' Ooh, this place smells a lot better than the Owl House.

[''The abomination butler offers Luz some tea, but Luz decides to give his face a makeover instead.'']

'''Luz:''' And...! [''turns the abomination butler's face into a kitty face, but it melts immediately'']

'''Luz:''' [''laughs''] Well, I tried. [''opens door and walks down the basement''] Hello? Mr. and Mrs. Blight? 

[''A severed abomination hand is thrown into the wall beside Luz.''] 

'''Luz:''' Eek!

'''Odalia:''' Oh don't mind him dear, he's getting ready for our big demonstration tonight. It's looking good hon! 

[''Alador grunts and tears something off.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm here to appeal to your hearts, Blights!

'''Odalia:''' That's sweet, but let's get to the deal. We have a rather important presentation tonight showing off some new products.

'''Luz:''' Like, abominations?

'''Odalia:''' Something like that. Normally Amity helps us with these things, but she's busy catching up on schoolwork.

'''Luz:''' I get it. I'll help you show off your weird abomination gunk if you promise to let me and my friends back into school.

'''Odalia:''' Don't worry human, a Blight always upholds their end of the deal. Now, you might want to go get ready, because we have...

[''Scene focuses on Luz's face while the surrounding transitions from the basement into the Blight Industry product event.'']

'''Odalia:''' ... a long night ahead of us folks! Welcome back to Blight Industries! 

[''Crowd applauds and cheers. Luz chuckles nervously with a worried expression on her face.'']

[''Scene cuts to Blight Industries exterior then back to the product event.'']

'''Luz:''' So, Alador, what would you say is the specialty of Blight Industries?

'''Alador:''' We make a variety of abomination-based accessories for home security.

'''Luz:''' Oh, that sounds pretty safe!

'''Alador:''' But we specialize in weaponry. [''walks away''] You might want to duck.

'''Luz:''' Huh? [''a lump of clay hits her, pinning her to the wall''] Whoa! 

[''Crowd cheers and applauds.'']

'''Odalia:''' Yes, our sticky launcher can peacefully subdue any foe! And, if peaceful isn't your thing... 

[''Odalia switches modes on the gun and turns it into a flamethrower. Crowd cheers and applauds. Luz gasps.'']

[''Scene cuts back to Blight Manor's living room. Amity walks in, removing her cowl.'']

'''Amity:''' Mom? I'm ready for the show tonight! 

[''Amity notices a note and takes it down to read it. On the note it says: "We found a replacement! -Mom"'']

'''Amity:''' We found a replacement? [''turns around and asks the abomination butler''] Did anyone come to the house today?

[''Amity notices the butler's disfigured face that somewhat resembles a cat, and growls angrily, knowing it was Luz.'']

[''Scene cuts to Willow's room. Willow is sitting and looking down with a sad expression as Harvey, her father, drops a pile of textbooks on her desk. [[Gilbert and Harvey Park|Gilbert]], her other father, also stands by the door.'']

'''Harvey:''' To make sure you're getting a top-notch education, we're quitting our jobs to homeschool you.

'''Gilbert:''' And we'll spend all our free time having fun as a family.

'''Harvey:''' See you at first light for a test on the uh- [''looks at the book he picked up''] life cycle of a common swamp toad! [''closes door'']

[''Willow continues to look down sadly, but an illusion of a tiny Gus appears.'']

'''Gus illusion:''' Willow! Hey, Willow! [''points at window'']

[''Willow gasps, then walks towards the window. Gilbert opens the door, causing Willow to gasp again.'']

'''Gilbert:''' Hey Willow, uh- 

[''Gilbert notices the tiny Gus illusion, then looks at Willow who is heading towards window. He smiles, puts a finger on his mouth, makes a "shhh" sound then closes the door. Willow smiles, then turns around and opens the window. Gus and Amity are standing outside below.'']

'''Amity:''' Luz needs our help!

'''Gus:''' [''annoyed''] Again.

[''Scene cuts back to Blight Industries exterior. Crowds can be heard cheering and applauding while Luz's terrified screaming is also heard. Gus, Willow and Amity are standing outside thinking how to get in.'']

'''Willow:''' Okay, I can use the root system underground to tunnel our way in.

'''Amity:''' That'll take too long. We should just rush the guards at the door!

'''Gus:''' No no no, I'll distract them with illusions of beautiful lady guards.

'''Willow:''' This isn't a cartoon from the '40s, Gus! We need a better plan!

'''Gus:''' This could work!

'''Amity:''' We should just bust our way through!

'''Gus:''' You're stunting my growth as an artist! Just let me try this!

'''Willow:''' We are running out of time! We gotta get in now!

'''Amity:''' We have to help Luz now!

'''Edric:''' Here's an idea. 

[''Gus, Willow and Amity look toward the sound.'']

'''Edric:''' Why don't you just walk through the front? [''throws each of them a cloak'']

'''Amity:''' Ed! Em! You're helping?

'''Emira:''' Of course! Just... don't tell Mom.

[''The trio put on their cloak and walk inside. Edric puts paper which says "Hex me!" on their back. The twins laugh at this, but Amity throws them back and they hit Edric in the face.'']

'''Edric:''' Ahhh! Ugh!

[''Amity points 2 fingers at the twins and walks backwards, growling.'']

[''Scene cuts to inside the factory. The trio runs inside into an excited crowd cheering and clapping while Luz is busy trying to get away from the Abomaton's attack.'']

'''Luz:''' [''pants''] Ah! [''ducks attack''] Whoa! [''ducks attack again'']

[''Luz uses ice glyph magic to block Abomaton's attack, but the arrow breaks the ice block, pushing Luz backwards. An abomination fist punches Luz upwards, Luz screams, and the hand catches her when she falls down. Crowd continues cheering and applauding. The Abomaton points the bow at Luz while Luz grunts and closes her eyes, waiting for the incoming attack.'']

'''Odalia:''' Thank you, thank you. And they say said we couldn't make crossbows more fun! Next, we're very excited to show you our last product from this line.

'''Luz:''' [''sigh of relief''] Oh my goodness, only one more to go.

'''Odalia:''' My husband has been toiling to bring you... 

[''Odalia steps aside, the ground opens up and Luz yelps and crawls away. An [[Abomaton]] rises up.'']

'''Odalia:''' THE ABOMATON 2.0!

[''The crowd gasps. So does Amity; she takes off her hood then turns around and starts climbing up a ladder.'']

'''Willow:''' Amity, wait! 

[''Gus and Willow take off their hood, but immediately gets grabbed by security abominations.'']

'''Odalia:''' It's bigger! It's better! The Abomaton 2.0 is the perfect soldier. It won't rest until its enemy is completely eliminated! 

[''Crowd oohs and a few of them claps.'']

'''Luz:''' [''laughs nervously''] You're a big boy, aren't ya? 

[''The Abomaton's hands turns into weapons. Luz makes a scared noise and looks at the abomaton with a terrified expression. The Abomaton starts attacking Luz, and manages to grab Luz by her foot.'']

'''Luz:''' Okay! It's super strong! I think the crowd gets it!

'''Alador:''' She has a point, Odalia.

'''Odalia:''' Didn't you hear me? It won't rest until its enemy is completely eliminated! 

[''The Abomaton lifts Luz up by her foot, Luz screams and is thrown upwards. Luz lands on a beam.'']

'''Luz:''' Okay, at least you can't get me up here... 

[''The Abomaton flies up and lands behind Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Luz, you fool! 

[''Luz uses an ice glyph to block the Abomaton. The Abomaton breaks it. Luz picks up a piece of shattered ice and use it as a sword to fight off the Abomaton.'']

[''Amity is seen climbing up a ladder while Luz keeps on fighting the Abomaton. She uses plant magic to lift herself up then swings around towards the Abomaton with a fire glyph just as it firesvanother blast. An explosion happens. The abomaton falls to the ground, breaking the floor. The crowd runs away. Luz is hanging onto a vine for dear life with her eyes shut. She opens her eyes and notices that she is facing the Abomaton and is close to the ground. The vine breaks.'']

'''Luz:''' Ah! [''lands''] Hey! I'm alive! 

[''The Abomaton grabs Luz by her foot again.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh, no. 

[''The Abomaton's hand turns into an axe and swings at Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm dead! [''closes her eyes, waiting for inevitable death, but something stops the Abomaton''] Huh? 

[''The Abomaton's hands explode.'']

'''Amity:''' HEY! 

[''Crowd gasps, Amity is seen standing on a beam.'']

'''Amity:''' STAY AWAY FROM MY LUZ! [''casts spell circles'']

'''Luz:''' [''looks at Amity with a surprised expression''] Amity? 

[''Scene cuts to the Owl House exterior. Hooty is wearing an ice crown and ice chain necklace with a popsicle in his mouth. He is looking at Lilith drawing something on a notepad. A sudden loud noise and vibration grabs their attention.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''knocks on door''] Edalyn? Are these distressed noises or normal noises? 

[''The ice blob is seen expanding slowly.'']

'''Eda:''' Totally normal! Don't come in! [''looks at the blob''] I am your mother! You will obey me and die! 

[''Eda hits the ice blob with a mace, but the mace is absorbed by the blob and Eda is pushed away by a spike.'']

'''Eda:''' Ugh!

'''King:''' Eda, help me! Help me, Eda! Eda, HELP ME!!! 

[''King is frozen inside the blob.'']

'''Eda:''' [''gasps with a horrified expression''] Ugh, fine! Lilith, emergency! 

[''Lilith kicks open the door.'']

'''Lilith:''' Whoa.

'''Eda:''' Yeah yeah, I messed up. I'm ready to follow the rules.

'''Lilith:''' Actually, I'd like to try an experiment. [''holds a few pieces of paper in her hands'']

'''Hooty:''' Hoooot! [''shakes his neck'']

[''Scene cuts back to inside Blight Industries. Amity slides down a rope and faces the Abomaton.'']

'''Amity:''' Huh-uh! [''lands'']

'''Odalia:''' [''uses her necklace''] Amity Blight, you are in so much troub-

[''Amity takes off and breaks her necklace. Odalia gasps.'']

'''Amity:''' Luz, [''looks back''] are you okay? 

'''Luz:''' [''looks at Amity with an amazed expression, blushing''] Uh-huh. [''gasps''] Look out! 

[''Amity's spell circle disappears, the Abomaton stands up and tries to punch Amity, but Amity holds him back with her spell circles with all her might. The Abomaton's hands start melting.'']

'''Odalia:''' [''angrily''] Amity! Get away from the human!

'''Amity:''' No, you're gonna listen to me for once. Luz, Gus and Willow are my friends! [''pushes the Abomaton backwards''] They're nice to each other, they listen to each other. They make me think about the kind of person I really WANT TO BE!!! 

[''Amity forces the Abomaton to kneel down. Luz runs towards Amity and they stand together back-to-back. They accidentally glanced at each other and immediately look away, both blushing with an awkward expression. Odalia looks at the "units ordered" meter angrily as Alador appears to be intrigued by the turn of events.'']

'''Odalia:''' Ugh! What do you want?!

'''Amity:''' Let my friends back into Hexside, or else your precious investors will watch me rip this thing apart bit. By. Bit.

'''Luz:''' [''whispers''] Can you actually do that?

'''Amity:''' Shhh!

[''Crowd boos.'']

'''Random investor 1:''' Come on!

'''Random investor 2:''' This is horrible!

[''Odalia looks at the "units ordered" meter in frustruation.'']

'''Odalia:''' [''groans''] Fine! It's a deal! Just stop with the theatrics! 

[''Luz and Amity glance at each other and smile. Amity stops using her spell circles. The Abomaton's hand changes into a large hammer and brings it down towards the duo. Amity rushes over to protect Luz. The Abomaton's hammer pounds right where the duo are. The Abomaton lifts up the hammer. The duo is seen pretending to have died. The Abomaton's hammer is revealed to be hollow in the middle and it transforms back to a normal hand. The duo open their eyes, look at each other and smile, then go back to pretend dying.'']

[''The Abomaton's eyes go dark. The crowd gasps. The Abomaton shuts down.'']

[''Crowd cheers and applauds.'']

'''Willow:''' Luz! 

[''Willow and Gus run towards Amity and Luz with worried expressions. The "units ordered" meter goes up so high it explodes. Odalia looks at Amity and Luz angrily.'']

'''Odalia:''' [''growls''] As if I'd actually let them go back! I will call every authority I know! I'll make sure they can't-

'''Alador:''' Odalia! 

[''Odalia turns towards Alador.'']

'''Alador:''' You made a deal with your daughter, and a Blight always upholds their end of the deal.

[''Scene cuts to Willow helping Luz get up. Willow, Luz, Gus and Amity walk away together.'']

'''Alador:''' Besides, she's getting stronger. [''puts hands on Odalia's shoulder''] Strong enough to become a coven head someday.

'''Odalia:''' [''grins''] Wise words, dear. We have to focus on what's best for the family-

[''Odalia turns around and notices Alador gone. She glances to her left and notices Alador chasing a butterfly.'']

'''Odalia:''' Alador! [''groans and facepalms'']

[''Scene cuts back to inside the Owl House. Both Lilith and Eda are drawing something on their paper respectively. King has a towel wrapped around his head and is holding a cup in his hands.'']

'''King:''' Ah-choo!

'''Eda:''' Okay so, uh, how did you beat that thing again?

'''Lilith:''' [''smugly''] Would you like me to lay out the basics?

'''Eda:''' [''stares at Lilith unhappily''] Yes. 

[''Scene flashes back to Lilith and Eda watching King freezing inside the ice blob.'']

'''Lilith:''' Well, you were right. These glyphs act like the basic elements. But, instead of containing like we do, they command the magic around them. They're like words! And drawing glyphs on top of each other like you did-

'''Eda:''' Was like screaming 3 different words at the same time! The spell got confused!

'''Lilith:''' Yes. The glyph combo, copyright me, Lilith, helps organize the commands...

[''Lilith slaps a paper with a glyph combo on it onto the ice blob. The ice blob flashes, then melts.'']

'''Lilith:''' ... so you can combine and specify what you want to do! 

'''King:''' [''shivers''] A-a-b-b-bout t-t-time!!!

[''Eda catches some snow in her hand and looks up above at the snow in wonder. Scene flashes back to the present.'']

'''Eda:''' So with the right combo, you can cast any spell!

'''King:''' Maybe the reason Luz hasn't found any more glyphs is because there... aren't any more.

'''Eda:''' Then we better start learning some new combinations. 

[''Sound of door being pushed open and hitting something.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey guys! [''wipes off abomination gunk of her hair'']

'''Eda:''' Hey Luz! We actually learned something new!

'''Luz:''' Sorry, can it wait 'till morning? [''tired expression''] I need to lie down. 

'''Lilith:''' Wait, Miss Teacher! 

[''Lilith turns to her left then turns back holding an ice sculpture. The sculpture is of her kneeling before Luz, who's being depicted as a wise scholar holding a scroll.'']

'''Lilith:''' Do I get extra credit?

'''Luz:''' [''amused''] Oh, my gosh!

'''Eda:''' [''stares jealously''] I can do it too. 

[''Eda slaps on a paper with ice glyph drawn on it. The glyph turns into and ice cube and rolls off the table.'']

'''Eda:''' Hmm. [''looks at Luz and gestures towards the ice cube'']

'''Luz:''' [''amazed''] Wow! Yeah! Extra credit for everyone! 

[''Luz throws 2 pieces of star-shaped paper to Lilith and Eda then walks away. Lilith catches one and holds it to her face gratefully while Eda and King just stare at her.'']

'''King:''' Ah-choo! 

[''Scene cuts back to inside the Blight Industries factory. The abomination servants are sweeping the floor. Odalia walks towards Alador.'']

'''Odalia:''' Oh despite the spectacle, this was quite a successful sale! Excellent job on the 2.0, dear.

'''[[Hunter|Golden Guard]]:''' Yes! [''walks in with 2 [[Coven Scout|coven scouts]]''] Your abomatons are quite extraordinary. Too bad no one will be receiving them. 

[''Odalia immediately kneels down, then makes Alador do the same.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' The emperor will be buying every one of your abomatons, and will personally fund research into making them stronger.

'''Odalia:''' [''looks up''] Th- That's great news! We are honored to have-

'''Golden Guard:''' You should be. [[Emperor Belos]] doesn't take kindly to citizens making a... private army. 

[''The Golden Guard turns and walks away. Alador and Odalia stand up look at each other with a worried expression.'']

[''Scene opens with [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] recording herself using her phone.'']

'''Luz:''' Hola, Mam! I know you dont want me staying in the [[Demon Realm]], but Im recording this because I think we can find a middle ground. This is a world of magic and beauty. [''points outside''] Just look!

[''Outside the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]], a skinless, skeletal [[Hooty]] is hanging out his skin to dry. The camera zooms in on his face. Hooty growls at the camera, while Luz screams and stops recording. Cut to Luz'' ''recording'' ''herself outside in'' ''[[Bonesborough]].'']

'''Luz:''' Well you should know, Im even learning magic! [''she'' ''activates a light glyph''] And as a human, it impresses pretty much everyone.

[''[[Boscha]] walks up from behind Luz and bumps into her. She accidentally stares into the light ball. She screams and covers her eyes.'']

'''Boscha:''' [''angrily''] Human! If you ever do that again I will set your eyes on fire!

[''Boscha forms a fire spell, causing Luz to cry out and stumble backwards. Cut to'' ''Luz recording'' ''herself inside [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]].'']

'''Luz:''' [''chuckles nervously''] Sure, the Demon Realm can be a little [''winces''] But theres no safer place than Hexside School of Magic and Demonics, right [[Principal Bump]]?

'''Principal Bump:''' Hmm? [''clears throat''] Why yes. The well-being of our students is our top priority. Which is why we send all out troublemakers to our new and improved detention pit.

[''Camera pans to the entrance to the Detention pit. A Hexside guard is dragging a student into the pit.'']

'''Bird student:''' Aah! Please, nooo!!!

[''The door opens up, and the guard the throws the student inside.'']

'''Bird student:''' Help me.

'''Luz:''' Thats enough of that. [''she covers the lens with her hand'']

'''[<nowiki/>[[The Owl House Main Theme|OPENING THEME]]]'''

[''Outside the school building, Luz, [[Gus Porter|Gus]] and [[Willow Park|Willow]] are sitting on the staircase.'']

'''Gus:''' You know, I think he does it cause hes shy. Hes just evil and shy. It happens.

'''Willow:''' I heard theres just a mirror underneath. [''whispers''] The real emperor was society all along.

'''Gus:'''  Maybe hes ''so'' handsome people have a hard time focusing on what he says. I get it I can relate. Luz! Youve seen [[Emperor Belos|Belos]] up close. Whats he like under all that?

'''Luz:''' Oh. I never got a good look.

[''[[Amity Blight|Amity]] suddenly appears beside Luz.'']

'''Amity:''' I heard hes scarred from wild magic.

[''Luz cries out in surprise and falls to the side.'']

'''Luz:''' [''sighs''] Amity!

'''Amity:''' Hola, batata.

'''Luz:''' Did you just call me a sweet potato?

'''Amity:''' Yes! Is that not a term of endearment? Im still figuring out this human language book from Gus.

[''Amity shows Luz a cookbook titled Mam Puras Recipes. Gus gives Amity 2 thumbs up and nods.'']

'''Luz:''' Aw! Amity, youre the sweet potato!

[''Luz and Amity both blush.'']

'''Amity:''' Uh, so Did that [[Titan's Blood|Titan Blood]] ever come in handy?

'''Willow:''' Did you finish building the door?

'''Gus:''' Did you visit your mom? [''teasingly''] Does she know about high-fives too?

'''Luz:''' Oh, uh

[''Scene cuts to flashback from [[Yesterday's Lie|Yesterdays Lie]], the moment when Luz is being pulled backwards and [[Camila Noceda|Camila]] tries to hold on to her.'']

'''Camila:''' [''tearily''] Promise me. When you come home, youll stay with me, and youll never go back to that place.

'''Luz:''' [''tearily''] Mom, its not you. It never was!

'''Camila:''' Please!

'''Luz:''' [''dejected''] Okay, mom. I promise.

[''Scene cuts back to current day.'']

'''Luz:''' Uh [''chuckles nervously''] Havent used the door yet. Waiting for a good moment, you know?

[''[[Owlbert]] hoots. Luz looks up just in time to see [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[King]] flying towards her on [[Owl Staff|the Owl Staff]].'']

'''Luz:''' Later taters!

[''Luz turns around to kiss Amity on the cheek, causing her to blush. Luz then rides off together with Eda and King.'']

'''Amity:''' [''sighs gladly''] Hmm?

[''Amity notices the phone Luz had left behind on the staircase. Luz's video is displayed on the screen.'']

[''Luz, Eda and King fly towards Bonesborough on the Owl Staff.'']

'''King:''' Come on, Luz. Theres no way your mom will make you leave the Demon Realm!

'''Eda:''' Yeah! When she meets us, Ill make sure to put on the charm that turns people into obedient zombies.

[''The trio land at the market place in Bonesborough, and Luz notices a lot of Coven Scouts around.'']

'''Luz:''' Woah, whats going on?

'''King:''' Theyre probably prepping for the annual [[Coven Day Parade]]. Floats, streamers, fireworks

'''Eda:''' [''angrily''] Ah, its just a fancy way to kiss the Emperors 

[''Eda almost blurts out a bad word. She looks at Luz, who squints at her judgingly while covering Kings ears.'']

'''Eda:''' ...Whatever. Im just here to pick something up. 

[''Eda walks off, with King following. Luz stops, spotting [[Kikimora]], who is speaking into a crow phone'']

'''Kikimora:''' Mother, please! No, Im not seeing anyone. Yes, Im standing up straight. Listen, I cant come home. If I dont lead this parade, Belos will end my No! No, of course I miss everybody. I What? I cant chose! Hello? Mother? Mother?

[''Luz runs off to join Eda and King. They are in front of a stand called Private Inspectergator'']

'''King:''' Hey, Luz! I know whatll cheer you up. 

'''Luz:''' Aw, no bread puns today, buddy. 

'''King:''' What? No. Im talkin about hot goss, girl! 

[''The stand owner hands over a file to Eda.''] 

'''King:''' Hot goss buns. Bread pun. Guess why were here! 

'''Eda:''' [''irritated''] King?

'''King:''' Eda hired someone to spy on her ex!

'''Eda:''' [''gasps''] Did you read my diary?!

'''King:''' And theyre Head Witch of the Bard Coven!

'''Eda:''' [''covers her ears''] Stop it! Stop it, stop it!

'''King:''' And they also

'''Eda:''' Yes! They secretly led a rebel group against the Emperor and got captured! I was there!

'''King:''' Ooh. [''sucks teeth''] I didnt read that far.

[''Luz gasps, becoming starry eyed, before collapsing to the ground.'']

'''Eda:''' Well, good job. You broke Luz.

'''King:''' It was the ''yeast'' I could do. [''laughs'']

[''The scene cuts forward. Luz is reading from the file handed to Eda.'']

'''Luz:''' And then [[Raine Whispers|Raine]] battled their fellow coven heads? And sacrificed everything to save Eda? [''crying''] Its just like [[Hecate]] and [[Azura]] in [[The Good Witch Azura|book 5]]!

[''Eda grabs the folder back from Luz.'']

'''Eda:''' According to this, Raine is still working with the Emperors Coven which doesnt make sense. They were seen as a traitor!

'''Luz:''' Maybe you can ask them about it. Look!

[''Luz points to a Coven Day Parade billboard, which has an image of Raine on it.'']

'''Eda:''' If theyre here for the parade, theyll probably be surrounded by scouts. Oh, wed need someone on the inside to lend us a hand. 

'''Luz:''' Hmm. 

[''Luz sees Kikimora, who walks by before tripping over a plank of wood'']

'''Luz:''' [''looking towards Eda''] Hmm?

'''Eda:''' [''snorts''] Yeah, right. As if shed give us the time of day.

[''Cut to Kikimora, teary eyed, and being consoled by Luz. Eda and King stand near'']

'''Kikimora:''' And and then she said if I dont make it back for the family reunion, Id be banished from Palm Stings and the family home! But Ive failed too many missions, and if I leave my job now, Ill be banished from my life! [''sobs'']

'''Luz:''' There you go. Its gona be okay. Maybe theres a way we can help each other out

[''Eda grabs Luz's hood and hoists her up from the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' Whoa!

'''Eda''': Are you out of your mind? Kikimora [[Young Blood, Old Souls|nearly turned me to stone]]. She [[Hunting Palismen|attacked you back in]] [[Latissa]], ''and'' she didnt blink when [[Eclipse Lake|your girlfriend was thrown down a pit]]! Oh, she is bad, and not the hot kinda bad.

'''Luz''': But this could be your way to talk to Raine! Isn't it worth the risk?

'''Eda''': Maybe. But what're ''you'' getting out of this?

[''Luz looks toward Kikimora'']

'''Kikimora''': On the one hand, I miss my family. On the other, Belos is not a forgiving man. But Im just a party planner at this point

[''Luz looks back to Eda'']

'''Luz''': I'm... just a sucker for romantic reunions?

'''Eda:''' This is true Ugh, fine!

'''Kikimora:''' Fine? Whats fine? What are you cretins planning?

'''Luz:''' Worry not, Kikimora. Were gonna help you by kidnapping you and Raine!

'''All (except Luz):''' What?

[''Cut to later, in another part of the market. Eda pulls a sheet out from a trash can. she sniffs it, groans, but takes it anyway. Cut to Luz purchasing several potions from [[Morton]]'']

'''Luz:''' Thanks, Morton!

[''Hooty regurgitates several coins, and the skeleton of a small animal, into Morton's hand'']

'''Hooty:''' Keep the change!

[''Luz walks past King and [[Edric Blight|Edric]]'']

'''Edric:''' I call it the Ed Ricochet 11. [''Edric pulls a large firework out from his coat''] Thats how many times I was sent to the Healing Coven.

'''King:''' Ooh! Wait, are these legal?

'''Edric:''' Would that make you more or less interested in buying them?

'''King:''' Hmm. 

[''Cut to King, chuckling with an arm's load of fireworks. He walks though the forest until he reaches Luz, Eda, and Hooty, who are working to construct a parade float.'']

'''Luz:''' Nice work, everyone.

[''King sets the fireworks down.'']

'''King:''' Nyeh.

'''Luz:''' Lets go over the plan one more time. King and Hooty will pilot the float during the parade. Once it gets to the halfway point, you two will set off all the glyphs, potions, and fireworks to distract people. 

'''King:''' With my love of mayhem and Hootys desperate need for attention, thisll be a cake walk!

'''Luz:''' When Kikimora sends off the guards to investigate, ''thats'' when Eda and I will obscure the stage and whisk her and Raine away. [''Luz's tone becomes slightly frantic''] The Coven cant banish Kiki if shes missing! Shell get the best of both worlds! Shell set an example for us all!

[''Eda, King, and Hooty all stare at Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' [nervously ''chuckles''] Um, I mean Eda gets to talk to Raine. Its romantic!

'''Eda:''' [''blushing''] Oh, its not ''that'' romantic.

'''Hooty:''' Witch, this is peak of Mount Romance.

'''King:''' Hooty, what would you know?

'''Hooty:''' Ive been around!

[''Luz riffles through her pockets.'']

'''Luz:''' Huh. Mustve left my phone at the Owl House.

[''Cut to Willow, who is working out on the balcony of her room. She goes to answer a knock at her door, finding Amity there'']

'''Willow:''' Amity!

'''Amity:''' Uh, hey, Willow. Its, uh, been a wile since I came here on my own. 

'''Willow:''' Yeah. I guess it has Are you okay?

[''Amity barges into the room, startling Willow.'']

'''Amity:''' So, Luz has been acting super weird, and I think shes lying about her trip to the [[Human Realm]], and she left her phoon, uh, phun? Ugh her thingy at school, and 

[''Amity drops onto Willow's bed and screams into the sheets.'']

'''Willow:''' You need to slow down for me.

'''Amity:''' Luz says she hasnt been to the Human Realm, but I just get the feeling that shes lying. And I can find out the truth by watching this! But Im not gonna invade her privacy like that. Would you?

'''Willow:''' Mmm [''shrugging''] Mm-mmm.

'''Amity:''' [''giggles''] Willow.

'''Willow:''' Listen, Blight, if you want my advice, theres something you have to do for me first Do you still know how to braid hair?

'''Amity:''' [''chuckles''] Okay. But I am a little rusty.  

[''Amity lets Willow's hair down, and begins braiding it.''] 

'''Amity:''' Im glad we can be like this again. 

[''Cut to Kikimora at the parade preparations.''] 

'''Kikimora:''' [''sighs''] This isnt going to work. I cant believe I let them talk me into this.

'''Raine:''' Who talked you into what?

[''The camera zooms out to reveal Raine, standing right next to Kikimora.'']

'''Kikimora:''' R-Raine? H-How long have you been there? [''stammers''] Shouldnt you be practicing your, um parade wave?

'''Raine:''' [''groans''] You know I hate these things. Talking to people. Waving to people. People.

[''They both shudder.'']

'''Raine:''' But Im just happy to do my part. 

'''Kikimora:''' You seem so much more calm than before.

[''[[Terra Snapdragon]], Head Witch of the Plant Coven, suddenly appears in front of Kikimora and Raine''.] 

'''Terra:''' Oh, why wouldnt they be? They were sick for a while, but thanks to me, theyre good as new!

'''Kikimora:''' T-Terra! And what brings you out of your greenhouse, Head Witch?

'''Raine:''' Terras been helping me recover. I cant remember anything with these [''winces''] headaches.

'''Terra:''' Here, sprout. Drink your tea. 

[''Terra drops a flower into the tea in Raine's drinking horn, turning the liquid pink. Raine then takes a sip.'']

'''Terra:''' There you go. Now. Youre gonna get on top of that float and wave to thousands of chumps all night. Remember to lead with your elbow.

'''Raine:''' Im on it.

[''Raine and Terra walk off together.'']

'''Kikimora:''' Terra could ruin everything! 

[''Kikimora starts dialing on her crow phone, but is interrupted by Terra.'']

'''Terra:''' Youre not trying to leave, are you? Come. The parade is about to begin.

[''Cut to sundown. The parade has now started. Eda and Luz overlook the parade from a rooftop.'']

'''Luz:''' Its almost time. 

'''Eda:''' Is that our float?

[''The camera cuts to the float: a larger than life effigy of Emperor Belos.'']

'''Luz:''' Not bad, right?

[''King and Hooty operate the float from inside. They cause the effigy to wink and make finger guns. The crowd cheers in response.'']

'''Bystander:''' [''teary eyed''] Its a work of art!

'''Luz:''' That was the signal! 

'''Eda:''' Lets move.

'''Luz:''' Okay. 

[''Eda leaps down from the roof. Luz tries to follow, but struggles to get down'']

'''Luz:''' [''yelps''] Uh I cant get down.

[''Cut to Kikimora, checking the time on her watch. Cut again to King & Hooty, likewise counting down the seconds.'']

'''King and Hooty:''' Four! Three! Two

[''Hooty and King pull a lever, launching fireworks from the float]''

'''Raine:''' [''gasps'']

[''The fireworks explode into the words "BELOS, more like BOO-LOS!" The crowd gasps.'']

'''Raine:''' [''groans'']

'''Coven Scout:''' [''To Kikimora''] Should we, uh, do something about that?

'''Kikimora:''' Yes, of course, you hangnails! I command all of you to invesgtigate!

[''The scouts run off. Eda and Luz set off smoke glyphs, engulfing Kikimora and Raine's float. Luz runs up to Kikimora and picks her up.'']

'''Luz:''' And scoop!

'''Kikimora:''' Ooh! I cannot believe we are being taken against our will. What sayeth you, fiend?

'''Luz:''' Uh! Thats right! I, Hecate, will whisk you away to my kingdom of mirrors and snakes!

[''Amity, who is in the parade crowd, is able to recognize Luz's voice. She facepalms while letting out an exasperated sigh.'']

'''Luz:''' [''hushed''] Hey, come on. I didnt know I had to prepare lines.

[''Eda uses a plant glyph to tie Raine up in vines. She slings Raine over her shoulder.'']

'''Eda:''' Knock it off, you two. Lets get crackin. [''Eda disappears with an invisibility glyph.'']

'''Luz:''' Right.  [''Luz likewise disappears.'']

'''King:''' Mission success, Hooty! Now, how do we get outta here?

'''Hooty:''' Were gonna have to be sneaky. 

[''Hooty uses his elongated body to lift the effigy of Belos.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hi! Its me! Your good buddy Belos! Worship me!

'''Coven Scout:''' Kill that monstrosity!

'''Hooty:''' [''laughs''] Not the first time Ive heard that! 

[''Under Hooty's control, the effigy begins hopping away. Several scouts give chase.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoot! Ha!

'''Coven Scout:''' Get him!

[''Eda and Raine reappear in an alley just as the scouts pass.'' ''Eda undoes the vines tying Raine.'']

'''Eda:''' Raine, Im so glad youre okay!

'''Raine:''' Eda? Whatre you doing here? 

'''Eda:''' I had to make sure you were okay after that fight with [[Darius]] and [[Eberwolf|Eber]].

'''Raine:''' What fight?

'''Eda:''' It was just a few weeks ago. I was with you.

'''Raine:''' Eda, I spent the last month sick in bed. And we we havent spoken in years.

'''Eda:''' [''gasps'']

'''Raine:''' Listen, I dont know what you want with me. But Im Head of a Coven now. And I cant associate with wild witches anymore. So move aside.

'''Eda:''' No. Im not leaving till I get through to you.

'''Raine:''' Fine. We can do this the hard way.

[''They both make ready to fight. Cut to Luz running down an alley with Kikimora. Hooty can be heard laughing in the distance.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh, my gosh, its working! Its actually working!

'''Kikimora''': Were visible? We need to disappear again! If were caught, she will end us!

'''Luz''': Who will end us?

[''The ground cracks, with giant plant carrying Terra emerging from them. Luz and Kikimora hide behind a cart''.]

'''Kikimora''': Head Witch of the Plant Coven, Terra Snapdragon.

[''Cut to the effigy of Belos, still being chased'']

'''Hooty:''' Law is meaningless! Stealing is legal now! I am your god!

[''Cut back to Luz and Kikimora'']

'''Terra:''' Oh, my word. Where could Kiki have gone? Such a valued member of the coven must be found post haste! [''A fly buzzes past Terra.''] Have you seen her little fly? [''Terra crushes the fly.''] Guess not.

[''Luz and Kikimora use an invisibility glyph to disappear'']

'''Terra:''' What a shame that Kikimora would disappear and right before her promotion. 

'''Kikimora:''' [''yelps'']

'''Terra:''' All the missions she would have led, the shiny new badge, the respect. Ah, well. Guess well have to fine ''someone else!''

[''Terra shoots a spiked vine towards Luz and Kikimora's position. At the last moment, the vine stops, held back by an abomination. Luz and Kikimora reappear and run off.''] 

'''Terra:''' Hmm. Another pest

[''Terra destroys the abomination. Cut to Luz running with Kikimora. Amity runs up to meet them''.]

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] Sweet potato? How did you know

'''Amity:''' Book 5, chapter 8, Azura pretends to kidnap Hecate

'''Luz:''' During the ice festival to save her from the wizard clan! You remembered my favorite part.

'''Amity:''' Yes, but right now I just want to keep my girlfriend from being sent to the Conformatorium again.

[''Amity uses her magic to form an abomination skateboard. The three hop on it.'']

'''Luz:''' Ooh.

[''Cut back to Eda and Raine, who begin fighting'']

'''Eda:''' Please. Rainestorm stop it. Ah!

[''Eda ducks below a magical blast from Raine'']

'''Raine:''' I dont want to hurt you, Eda. But youre not giving me much of a choice.

'''Eda:''' Come on, Raine! I know when youre going easy on me.

'''Raine:''' I [''groans'']

[''They continue fighting. Eda blocks Raine's bow with her staff''.]

'''Eda:''' Did you forget this too?

[''Eda pulls out a cassette player, playing a recording of them performing "Raine's Rhapsody" together.'']

'''Raine:''' [''grunts''] Why wont you just leave me alone?

[''Raine sends out a blast which knocks Eda to the ground'']

'''Eda:''' [''grunts'']

'''Raine:''' For old times sake, Ill give you one last chance. Move please.

[''Eda shakes her head no''.]

'''Raine:''' So be it.

'''Coven Scout 1:''' I think I heard something over here!

'''Coven Scout 2:''' Head Witch! Are you there?

'''Coven Scout 1:''' Surround the area!

[''Eda searches for another invisibility glyph, but can't find one on her. Raine grabs one from the ground and hesitantly hands it to Eda.'']

'''Raine:''' Go home. Maybe travel for a bit. Just dont contact me again. I work for the Emperor, after all.

'''Coven Scout 1:''' Head Witch! 

[''Eda uses the glyph to disappear''.]

'''Coven Scout 1:''' Head Witch! Are you hurt?

'''Raine:''' No, not badly. Lets return to the parade.

[''Cut to a dock at the edge of Bonesborough, which Kikimora's hand-dragon, Princess, lays at the end of. Luz, Amity, and Kikimora make their way across the dock.'']

'''Luz:''' Okay, Kikimora. Princess here will get you back to your family in Palm Stings by morning. Shes a good girl, and Im sorry to say goodbye, but Bump couldnt keep her at his place anymore. [''Luz sets Kikimora onto Princess''] Isnt it great? Youll see everyone at the reunion, and when you return, you can brag about your daring escape! Youre walking proof that you dont have to chose between worlds!

'''Kikimora''': [''sighs''] Youve been such a help to me, human. You really are a kind person... and an utter fool! [''laughs'']

'''Luz:''' Wha?

'''Kikimora:''' Palm Stings can burn for all I care! You heard Terra. They want to promote me! ''Me!''

'''Amity:''' She could have been lying.

'''Kikimora:''' Thats a risk Im willing to take. Maybe as a thank you I could give Belos a few gifts. A troublemaking human and Ah. [''to Amity''] Youre the little firestarter from Eclipse Lake.

[''Princess lunges to attack. Amity forms a fire spell while Luz sets down an ice glyph.'']

'''Luz:''' Amity! Now!

[''The fire and ice spells combine to form a smoke screen, allowing Luz and Amity to run further down the dock. Amity forms an abomination gauntlet, which Luz imbues with an ice glyph''.]

'''Luz:''' You got em.

[''Amity fires the gauntlet at Princess, causing ice to form around Kikimora and her dragon.''] 

'''Kikimora:''' [''gasps'']

[''Luz and Amity keep running. But Kikimora and Princess, thawed by the Boiling Sea, block their path'']

'''Kikimora:''' Yes. Thank you Luz, for all the help.

'''Luz:''' Youre welcome! I mean Ah, dang it!

[''Vines suddenly emerge from the sea, tying Princess down to the ground.'']

'''Luz and Amity:''' [''gasp'']

'''Kikimora:''' What is this?

[''The vines tie down Kikimora as well. Terra emerges from the Boiling Sea''.]

'''Terra:''' Oh, Kiki, try not to get ahead of yourself. The Emperor has a great many plans, but causing a riot by hurting a couple of children is not one of them.

'''Kikimora:''' Terra! Shouldnt you be babysitting the bard?

'''Terra:''' I wasnt sent here to watch over Raine. I was sent here to watch over you. 

[''Terra causes the vines to recede from Kikimora, freeing her.'']

'''Terra:''' The promotion is real. You just had to prove your dedication.

'''Kikimora:''' Did I pass?

'''Terra:''' Unfortunately, yes.

'''Kikimora:''' [''squeals''] So? Whats the promotion? Whos under my command? What do I get?

'''Terra:''' You get to live. [''groans''] Come Kiki, time to head back.

[''The vines re-wrap around Kikimora, dragging her and Princess away.'']

'''Terra:''' [''to Luz''] The Emperor says hes looking forward to meeting you, human. Until then, happy Coven Day.

[''Luz and Amity both let out a sigh'']

'''Luz:''' Amity, Amity! Amity, you saved me. How can I make it up to you?

'''Amity:''' Maybe you can tell me about this.

[''Amity pulls out Luz's phone, with the video still displayed on the screen.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps'']

'''Amity:''' Dont worry. I havent watched it. But you did finish the portal door. You did see your mom. And it looks like it didnt go well.

'''Luz:''' Im sorry.

'''Amity:''' I know this situation is crazy, and Im okay taking things one day at a time. But, I cant help if I dont know whats going on.

'''Luz:''' You just looked so hopeful. You were even learning Spanish. And I thought if I helped out Kikimora, maybe thered be hope for me.

'''Amity:''' Tell me what happened.

'''Luz:''' Okay. So, I had finished the door. But it didnt look like the normal portal. I must have missed something. We opened it and

[''Luz continues talking as she and Amity walk back toward the parade.'']

[''Cut back to the parade. Coven scouts hose down the now flaming effigy of Belos as King and Hooty escape into the crowd, giggling to each other. Kikimora, Raine, and Terra stand on a podium in front of a crowd. Eda, Luz, Amity, King, and Hooty watch from a rooftop.'']

'''Kikimora:''' [''to the crowd''] Um, thank you, Bonesborough, for joining us during this years Coven Day Parade. This year is extra special because the Emperor himself has an announcement to make.

[''A massive projection of Emperor Belos appears behind the podium.'']

'''Belos:''' Thank you, everyone. Together we are perfecting the Coven System as the Titan intended. The Day of Unity will be in exactly one month, when the tile is at its lowest and the moon obscures the sun. At that time, we will journey to the head of the isles, and there, the worthy shall inherit a utopia free of wild magic.

[''The crowd gasps'']

'''King:''' Free of wild magic? Hows he supposed to do that?

'''Belos:''' There is one more thing Id like to share with you. Ive always hidden my face, out of fear. But because of your support, I can finally take off this mask.

'''Eda:''' [''spits''] So phony. Hes just trying to distract us from his crazy utopia talk! Too bad it wont work.

[''Belos removes his mask. The crowd gasps again.'']

'''Belos:''' Thank you, Boiling Isles.

[''The crowd cheers.'']

'''Bystander:''' We love you grandpa!

[''Cut to Willow and Gus, watching the parade on Willows scroll. They gasp, but quickly become unimpressed'']

'''Willow and Gus:''' Eh.

'''Belos:''' Happy Coven Day, everyone!

[''The projection of Belos explodes into fireworks. The crowd begins chanting Belos name.'']

'''Amity:''' Is Belos planning something? And why did he say hes going to meet you again? Didnt you already meet him? What else dont I know? Whats gonna happen?

'''Luz:''' I Im not sure. But for now well take things one day at a time.

[''The chanting of Belos name continues'']

[''Scene opens from [[Luz Noceda|Luz's]] point of view. She slowly opens her eyes and groans. Cut to a third person view where Luz is lying on the floor. She looks to her left and then sits up, finding herself in a dimly lit corridor. On the walls of both sides, there are multiple huge paintings. Luz then looks to her front and gasps. In front of her, there is a huge painting depicting [[Emperor Belos]] holding his [[Belos's staff|staff]] while looming over her, [[King]], [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] and [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] in her [[Owl Beast]] form. Below the painting is a plaque which says "TRIUMPH OVER WILD MAGIC". Luz then stands up and moves backwards with a frightened expression on her face.'']

'''Luz:''' What is this place?

'''[[Hunter]]:''' ''You'' know exactly where we are, [[Human|human]].

[''Luz turns around to find Hunter staring at her angrily.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''furiously''] ''You'' got ''us'' trapped in the Emperor's ''MIND!''

'''Luz:''' Huh?!

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|OPENING THEME,]] but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.''']

[''Back to Hunter and Luz inside Belos's [[Mindscape|mindscape]]. Luz looks around incredulously.'']

'''Luz:''' ''We're'' in the Emperor's mind? That's bananas!

'''Hunter:''' I don't know what those are, and I don't care too. Remember what happened at the [[Night Market]]?

[''Scene flashes back to earlier at the Night Market.'']

'''Peddler:''' Teeth! Get your teeth! We got all varieties and qualities!

[''The peddler puts his hand on a person's shoulder.'']

'''Peddler:''' I even do trades.

[''The peddler takes out a pair of pliers as he speaks. The person he puts his hand on turns around, who is revealed to be Hunter in his [[Golden Guard]] attire. This catches the peddler by surprise.'']

'''Peddler:''' Oh, I... mean, why would I trade teeth? That's illegal and unsanitary. But, I mean, if you're interested...

[''Hunter notices 3 hooded suspicious figures walking nearby.'']

'''Hunter (narrating):''' I heard whispers of an attempt to invade the Emperor's mind with wild [[magic]]. I decided to take the villains out myself.

[''Hunter follows the 3 hooded figures into an alley and hides behind a barrel. Although not outright shown, the 3 figures are implied to be [[Raine Whispers|Raine]], [[Darius]], and [[Eberwolf]]. After Eberwolf finishes drawing some circles on the ground, Raine starts playing their flute, while Darius mixes up some liquid in a test tube he is holding. He then puts the test tube on the ground, and transforms his left hand into an [[Abomination]] hammer, preparing to break it.'']

'''Hunter (narrating):''' But just as I was about to stop them...

[''Hunter jumps out from behind the barrel and confronts the trio.'']

'''Hunter:''' Halt! For crimes [''takes out his [[Hunter's staff|mechanical staff]]''] against the Emperor, you are under arrest!

[''Luz suddenly pops up from below and blocks the screen.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh, wait! I remember now!

'''Hunter:''' Hey!

[''The scene behind Luz starts rewinding as she ducks back down. The entire scene rewinds back to some point of time earlier. When it stops, it shows a door with a glass panel, and a sign with the "OPEN" part facing the camera. The scene is taken from inside a building.'']

'''Luz (narrating):''' [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] took me and [[King]] to the Night Market to repair my [[Witch's Wool|witch's wool]] [[Witch's Cloak|cape]]. But, we ran into some trouble.

[''Eda knocks on the glass panel.'']

'''Eda:''' Hello? Prim? Did you get into the [[Apple Blood|Night Juice]] again? [''sing-songy''] Hello?

[''Scene cuts to Eda and Luz outside the door. King's voice comes up from a walkie-talkie Luz is holding.'']

'''King:''' Is this thing on? Demon King to Luzura, you copy?

[''Luz turns to her left to and calls out to King.'']

'''Luz:''' Sure do!

[''King pops out from a tub filled with skulls.'']

'''King:''' [''in a low voice''] Use the walkie!

'''Luz:''' Oh, uh, right. [''turns around''] 10-4, Demon King. Luzura here with Echo, Delta, Alfa. What's your 20? Over.

'''King:''' Uh, oh. Uh... ''Hable ms lento, por favor.'' [''Subtitles: Speak more slowly please'']

'''Luz:''' Aw, you remembered your lesson. But that wasn't Spanish, buddy. I read you loud and clear! Over.

'''Eda:''' Hey, Prim!

[''Eda bangs on the glass panel again. Someone finally opens the door.'']

'''Eda:''' Ah, there you are. [''squats down''] I need more witch's wool. I got a kid with cold shoulders and a knack for gettin' into trouble.

'''Prim:''' The shop is closed, Eda. I've... finally decided to join a coven.

[''Prim shows Eda and Luz an Oracle coven sigil on her wrist, much to Eda's dismay.'']

'''Prim:''' Emperor Belos says wild [[Witch|witches]] celebrate destruction and... pain. 

'''Eda:''' I mean, I know I can be... abrasive, but-

'''Prim:''' He also says that the [[The Titan|Titan]] punishes those who aid wild witches. I can't have you here.

[''Prim shuts the door. Luz glances over at Eda, then becomes angry.'']

'''Luz:''' Well, what does he know?! [''walks towards the door''] Belos is a liar. He just wants [''bangs on the door''] power! And I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that he can't speak to the Titan!

[''Everyone around gasps.'']

'''[[Animal Control|Purple-haired witch]]:''' Do you think she's right?

'''Yellow demon with horns:''' Don't let the Titan hear you say that. Belos says he can read minds.

'''Purple-haired witch:''' What even is a doughnut?

[''The crowd disperses. Eda notices people's reaction and calls out to Luz.'']

'''Eda:''' Hey, I'll be fine. You're the one who needs to be careful.

'''Luz:''' But people should know who Belos really is!

'''Eda:''' And who is he, really?

[''Luz is unable to give an answer.'']

'''Eda:''' Listen, Belos has been Emperor for 50 years. Everyone is used to this. No one's gonna risk change unless you have proof that he's up to something.

[''Eda notices that Luz is looking dejected.'']

'''Eda:''' Ah, come on. [''punches Luz's shoulder''] We'll figure something out. But first, let's see if there are any respectable criminals left in this city.

[''As Eda speaks, she stands up and takes out her [[Owl Staff]] from her hair, then walks away while everyone around gives her dirty looks and whisper among themselves. King walks up to Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' I hate seeing people look at Eda that way. But how can I prove he's actually evil? It feels so obvious, but no one believes me! No one answers my letters! [''groans and scratches her head''] I don't know what to do!

'''King:''' No one wants to think they've wasted their life following the wrong person. You just gotta find something big to change their minds.

[''King walks away to follow Eda. Luz looks down thoughtfully.'']

'''Luz:''' King's right. How can I find that something?

[''Luz suddenly notices something and gasps. Not far away from her, she sees Hunter running into an alley.'']

'''Luz:''' [''rolls up her sleeve''] Perfect timing.

[''Scene cuts to Hunter running past a barrel. Luz's head then pops up from behind it. Scene changes again to show Hunter approaching Raine, Darius and Eberwolf while Luz sneaks up on Hunter from behind.'']

'''Hunter:''' Halt!

[''Raine and Darius turn around to look at Hunter. Darius restores his Abomination hammer hand to normal state.'']

'''Hunter:''' For crimes against the Emperor, you are all under arrest!

'''Luz:''' Hunter!

[''Luz pounces up on Hunter from behind, causing both of them to crash into the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey! [''takes out a pen''] Can I bug you with a few questions?

'''Hunter:''' [''sits up''] Human?!

[''Raine proceeds to start playing their flute and create a smokescreen.'']

'''Hunter:''' No, no, no! Stop! I forbid you to flee!

[''By the time the smoke disperses, Raine, Darius and Eberwolf are all gone. Hunter groans in frustration, then turns around and takes of his mask.'']

'''Hunter:''' Human! Do you know what you've just done?!

[''Hunter takes out his [[Hunter's staff|staff]], but accidentally steps onto something and breaks it, causing it to start glowing. He glances downwards and notices that he had stepped on a neon yellow vial. The liquid flashes brightly.'']

'''Luz:''' Uh... what's that?

[''The circles Luz and Hunter are standing in start flashing brightly, causing them to cry out in shock. The light then wraps them up and shoots up into the night sky, creating a firework. Scene cuts to Hunter's witch's staff falling to the ground, but it then transforms to [[Flapjack]] as he lands next to Hunter's mask. He looks down at the broken glass pieces sadly, then looks up and chirps.'']

[''Scene cuts back to Luz and Hunter in Belos' mindscape. Hunter bursts out laughing.'']

'''Hunter:''' ''You'' want to prove that ''my uncle'' is ''evil?'' And you thought ''I would help?'' [''continues laughing'']

'''Luz:''' Well, now that I'm in his mind, I can learn the truth for myself. [''notices something''] Weird though. I've been in [[Willow Park|Willow's]] mind once, and it had uh, more, trees.

'''Hunter:''' Eh, makes sense. Mindscapes reflect the individual. I've read a lot about this subject.

[''Hunter suddenly notices something and gasps. He walks towards it.'']

'''Hunter:''' Whoa, look at this memory!

[''Scene cuts to a painting depicting Belos guiding people away from a burning town. Hunter and Luz approach it.'']

'''Hunter:''' You know, unfettered wild magic wiped out our family. Everyone knew too much and got themselves hurt. That's why Belos took in the survivors, and dedicated his life to making the [[Coven System]]! [''runs towards another painting''] It's why he's so well liked!

[''Hunter stops next to a painting depicting people happily reaching out their hands towards Belos, who is holding a glowing floating orb with his left hand.'']

'''Hunter:''' Our sigils protect us from ourselves, and make the Titan happy.

[''Hunter notices another painting to his left and gasps, then walks towards it.'']

'''Hunter:''' Oh! This is when I inherited my staff! You know, I'm the youngest [[Coven Scout|scout]] to become Golden Guard. I, uh, never found out what happened to the previous one. 

[''Scene cuts to Luz looking at Hunter with a uneasy expression on her face.'']

'''Hunter:''' Huh, why does Darius look so sad here?

[''Luz starts looking around and notices the painting she first saw when she woke up. She walks up to it, and touches the part where Owl Beast Eda is drawn at with a glum look on her face. Suddenly, she hears the sound of a child crying. She follows the sound, and finds a child figure sitting behind a pillar sobbing. He notices Luz and immediately stands up, frightened by her presence.'']

'''Luz:''' [''hesitantly''] Belos?

'''Hunter:''' Belos?

[''Luz and Hunter both speak out at the same time, much to Luz's surprise. The child figure turns around and runs away.''] 

'''Luz:''' Huh?

[''Luz turns around and notices a dark figure resembling Belos approaching them.'']

'''Hunter:''' Emperor, you're here! We [''kneels down''] beg for your assistance to return to the physical world, so that I may capture your enemies! And so [''looks back at Luz annoyedly''] she can ruin someone else's day.

[''The dark figure stops in front of Hunter. The child figure emerges from behind it and shakes his head and hands at the duo desperately. Luz looks at him with a puzzled expression when suddenly, the dark figure roars and starts transforming, revealing multiple glowing eyes on its body while also screeching.'']

'''Luz:''' Hunter! Watch out!

[''Luz rushes to the front of Hunter and takes out some [[Fire Glyph|fire glyphs]] from her pocket, then slaps on it. This creates an explosion with blasts strong enough to send everyone flying backwards. Luz and Hunter roll on the floor then crash through a wall, falling down a dark void. Luz takes out a [[Safety Hover|hover glyph]] from her pocket, grabs onto Hunter, then activates it before they hit the ground. They manage to come to a halt near the ground, but the paper then disintegrates, causing them to crash into the ground face-first. The duo sit up, as Luz rubs her head in pain.'']

'''Hunter:''' Where are we now?

[''Luz looks up to see the hole they came through just now disappears.'']

'''Luz:''' We must be in the Emperor's real mind.

[''The duo stands up and finds themselves in a strange place filled with dead trees. Some paintings can be seen on the tree trunks.'']

'''Hunter:''' What do you mean the Emperor's real mind? [''looks upwards''] That gallery-

'''Luz:''' Was made of all the lies he tells. He's not who you think he is.

[''Hunter notices an abandoned [[Palisman|palisman]] on the ground and picks it up. The palisman then disintegrates in his hand, causing it to tremble. Hunter then stands up.'']

'''Hunter:''' We're probably being punished because [''points at Luz''] you provoked his inner self.

'''Luz:''' Well, his inner self had a thousand glowing eyeballs!

'''Hunter:''' [''mockingly''] Oh, no! Eyeballs! You're so easy to scare.

[''Luz looks at Hunter with an irritated expression on her face. Eda's voice suddenly comes out from Luz's walkie-talkie.'']

'''Eda:''' Boo!

'''Hunter:''' [''startled''] Ah!

[''Luz takes out her walkie-talkie.'']

'''Eda:''' Luz, where are you? Oh, wait. Hey, blondie, your friend wants to talk to you.

'''Hunter:''' Uh...

[''Flapjack's chirp comes out from Luz's walkie-talkie. Hunter immediately grabs it from Luz's hand.'']

'''Hunter:''' Flapjack! Are you okay? Have they hurt you?

[''Luz snatches the walkie-talkie from Hunter's hands.'']

'''Luz:''' Give me that! So, Eda. We may kinda sorta be trapped in, uh... the Emperor's mind.

'''Eda:''' [''gasps''] How in the world did you- No, we don't have time for that. Has the Inner Belos spotted you yet?

'''Luz:''' Yes, but we were able to get away... with help. Can there be two inner selves?

'''Eda:''' No. But I have heard of strong emotions materializing. Just stay safe. If you're devoured in his mindscape-

'''Hunter:''' We'll be trapped! [''Luz turns back to look at him pacing back and forth looking worried''] Dragged down into his subconscious forever. I... told you I read about this stuff.

'''King:''' Well, we're gonna get you out! We'll make a return spell as fast as we can!

'''Eda:''' Just don't lose the walkie-talkie. It's our only connection to you.

'''Luz:''' You got it, Owl Lady. Over and out.

'''Hunter:''' Wait!

[''Hunter snatches the walkie-talkie from Luz's hand.'']

'''Hunter:''' I'll be home soon, Flapjack. Stay safe.

[''Flapjack chirps.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''whispers''] I love you. Over and out.

[''Flapjack chirps.'']

'''Eda and King:''' Aww!

[''Hunter ends the transmission and throws the walkie-talkie back to Luz. Suddenly, they hear sounds of leaves rustling.'']

'''Hunter and Luz:''' Huh?

[''They look towards the source of sound and see the child figure from before emerging from behind a tree.'']

'''Luz:''' It's you! Kid Belos!

'''Hunter:''' What?

[''Luz walks towards Kid Belos and kneels down before him.'']

'''Luz:''' Thank you for helping us before. You don't seem as scary as your inner self.

[''Suddenly, from somewhere above, Inner Belos screeches, which surprises Luz and Kid Belos. He covers his ears, then runs towards Luz and grabs her arm.'']

'''Luz:''' If strong emotions can take form, maybe he's the Emperor's... I don't know, sense of guilt?

'''Hunter:''' [''laughs''] What? Belos has never done anything worthy of feeling guilt. It's obviously his... uh, sense of innocence. His pure intentions!

'''Luz:''' Well, [''looks back at Kid Belos''] whichever it is, I think he can help us stay safe. [''whispers to Kid Belos''] And maybe you can show us who Belos really is.

[''Kid Belos nods.'']

'''Hunter:''' What was that?

[''From somewhere above, Inner Belos screeches again. Kid Belos grabs Luz's arm and drags her away.'']

'''Luz:''' No time! Let's go, go, go!

[''Hunter runs after the duo. Kid Belos leads Luz to a painting and jumps through it. Luz prepares to follow suit.'']

'''Hunter:''' Wait! You're just gonna invade his memories? That's sacrilege! 

[''Somewhere above, Inner Belos screeches again.'']

'''Luz:''' It's a way to survive!

[''Luz grabs Hunter's arm and drags him towards the painting. Both fall into the painting together.'']

[''Scene cuts to outside the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]]. Eda arrives back on the Owl staff with King and Flapjack. She then flings the door open.'']

'''Eda:''' [[Hooty]], I need you to lock down the house. Windows shut, curtains drawn, absolutely zero distractions. 

[''As she speaks, she grabs some stuff from the ledge above the fireplace.'']

'''Eda:''' King, go grab all the textbooks you can find.

[''King runs off.'']

'''Eda:''' [''groans''] This is gonna be tough without magic. Hooty! Chop-chop!

'''Hooty:''' Ma'am! 

[''Hooty proceeds to barricade all the windows, summon some spiky plants from the ground to surround the house, and latch the front door shut with multiple locks. He then hangs a sign outside the front door which says: "BRB!". Not far away, Raine, Darius and Eberwolf are hiding in the bushes. Raine intends to go near the house, but is stopped by Darius.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''to Flapjack''] Oh, hey, your buddy's trapped too, right? The angry blond kid?

[''At the mention of Hunter, Darius immediately rushes forward, but Raine halts him.'']

'''Hooty:''' Eda's smart but... without magic, [''shakes his head sadly''] I'm afraid she can't do much.

[''Raine crosses their arms as Darius scratches his head. Eberwolf pops out from a bush beside them. Raine then proceeds to write on the ground to communicate with the duo. They write: "I KNOW HOW TO GET PAST THE BIRD", "<s>OWL?</s>", "<s>TUBE???</s>", "HIM!!!" (sketch of Hooty with arrows pointing at it).'']

[''Scene cuts back to Belos' mindscape, where Luz and Hunter fall out of the painting Luz previously pulled them into. Kid Belos appears out of thin air in front of them, and runs away while laughing. The duo follows him to an area depicting one of Belos' memories - which takes place during [[Deadwardian Era]] somewhere in [[Bonesborough]]. Multiple townspeople have gathered in front of an empty platform. Kid Belos vanishes as he approaches the crowd, while Luz and Hunter run towards the platform and stop in front of it.'']

'''Male townsperson:''' He says he can talk to the Titan.

'''Female townsperson:''' The Titan's dead, how is that possible?

[''Belos steps onto the platform, the townspeople gasp.'']

'''Belos:''' Fellow citizens, we are born into chaos. [''bows down''] Our lives anger the Titan. My own family has been hurt by the darkness of wild magic.

[''As he's speaking, a past version of his artifical magic staff sparks and smoke comes out of it, obscuring everything around him, he starts to twirl his staff, clearing the smoke, and 9 differently coloured lights shine from it.'']

'''Belos:''' I've been shown the healing light, it shines in nine hues!

[''The townspeople gasp in delight.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''nudges Luz''] See? He's always been helping people.

[''Explosions suddenly start to go off everywhere around Belos.'']

'''Belos:''' The wild witches! They have found me, run!

[''Scene cuts to Luz and Hunter running to an alleyway nearby, and sees another part of Belos' memory where he is standing in front of a previous Golden Guard scolding him.'']

'''Belos:''' You incompetent fool! You nearly took my head off with that blast.

'''Previous guard:''' I'm... sorry, Lord Belos.

'''Belos:''' I'm off to the next town.

'''Previous guard:''' Uh, what about... the rest of these?

[''He takes off a blanket revealing various boxes of unused explosives.'']

'''Belos:''' Put on a ''bigger'' show.

[''Hunters face turns to a mix of shock and realization. The previous Golden Guard ignites the fuse, then follows Belos into a building. Kid Belos then appears, picks up a bag filled with what sounds to be glass bottles, and jumps through another painting. Luz and Hunter follow suit, and lands outside the memory.'']

'''Luz:''' Belos was lying! Wild witches weren't attacking him. How could you help someone like that? [''points to Hunter'']

'''Hunter:''' That was... probably a... special technique to get people to listen to his message. It's... It's for the greater good.

[''Luz looks angrily at Hunter for a second before the inner Belos starts to creep out of a memory, reaching towards Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Ah! He found us! 

[''Kid Belos laughs and jumps into another memory, Luz and Hunter follow him in. This memory takes place at the top of [[the Knee]], where Belos is standing in front of a group of nine witches and [[Demon|demons]]. Kid Belos jumps up and grabs a loose rope hanging off one of them before running away.'']

'''Hunter:''' What's the kid doing?

'''Luz:''' Shh!

[''Belos gestures towards a burning city in front of the crowd.'']

'''Belos:''' Look at what wild magic has done to your city. Now imagine what it's doing to you. A city can rise from the ashes, but a soul...

[''Belos shakes his head slowly. The crowd becomes uneasy and murmurs among themselves.'']

'''Horned witch:''' [''gasp''] What does that mean?

'''Green-eyed witch:''' Wait, what?

'''Belos:''' I can make your magic pure again, as The Titan intended!

[''A previous Golden Guard, presumably a different one from the last, appears next to Belos, a yellow glow emitting from his finger. The crowd extends their arms outwards, and the previous guard uses his finger to brand a coven sigil onto each of them, representing all nine covens.'']

'''Belos:''' Welcome, to your new covens!

[''The horned witch looks down at the sigil branded onto her wrist. Suddenly, lines start to come out of it, spreading throughout her entire body as she exclaims in pain and panic. Her eyes glow, and the scene cuts to the other eight group members with the same effect as they all drop one by one to the ground, becoming unconscious. The previous guard kneels down next to the horned witch and checks her pulse.'']

'''Previous guard:''' They're... still alive.

'''Belos:'''  Then we still have some work to do. Gather the Palismen.

[''The previous guard brings two staffs to Belos, who snatches one of the Palisman off its staff and crushes it before walking away. The horned witch gasps softly and the previous guard turns around to look at her writhing in pain before he walks away. The camera moves to Luz and Hunter standing behind her. Luz looks horrified while Hunter has a tense expression on his face. Luz then looks at him in concern. Scene changes to a view from above showing Hunter and Luz looking down at the crowd. A strong gust of wind blows past, bringing along some snow which then obscures the view. '']

[''Scene cuts to outside the memory. Kid Belos jumps out of the painting while laughing. Hunter then comes out from it and runs off. Luz emerges from the painting a while later.'']

'''Luz:''' You can't deny it now. Belos is trying to hurt people!

'''Hunter:''' He was just... perfecting sigil magic! Besides, maybe, he's remembering things wrong. Who knows how mindscapes work?

[''Hunter notices Kid Belos emerging from behind a tree while laughing.'']

'''Luz:''' I thought you did!

'''Hunter:''' [''angrily''] Well, maybe I'm an idiot! [''to Kid Belos''] You! Get back here!

[''Hunter rushes towards Kid Belos, but before he can catch him, Kid Belos suddenly stops and turns around. The sound of Inner Belos screeching then appears behind Hunter, prompting him to turn around.'']

'''Luz:''' Huh?

[''Luz turns around and sees a tall and lanky skeletal Inner Belos approaching her and Hunter. It then screeches at the duo, causing them to scream in fear and immediately start running away before it can catch them. They follow Kid Belos to another painting, but Hunter suddenly hesitates and stops. He turns around to look at the Inner Belos, who is growling and slowly approaching him, causing him to retreat in fear.'']

'''Luz:''' Hunter!

[''Hunter looks back at Luz. She extends her hand towards him, and after hesitating for a bit, he grabs her hand. Luz then drags him into another memory of Belos'. Part of Inner Belos' skull comes through the painting, sniffs, then leaves. Both Luz and Hunter let out a sigh of relief. Kid Belos pushes Luz's arm away, then runs forward to pick up empty glass bottles from the ground and put them into his sack. Not far away, Luz is shocked to see the [[Portal|portal]] she destroyed before has been restored.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] He's got the portal?! [''to Hunter''] Did you know about this?

'''Hunter:''' Of course. I helped rebuild it.

'''Belos:''' I can hear you.

[''Luz and Hunter appear surprised at what Belos just said. Not far away, he walks towards the portal, but then stops and looks back. From somewhere behind Luz and Hunter, someone starts laughing maniacally, prompting them to turn around and look up at a tree behind them. A pair of glowing eyes then appear from the darkness within the tree branches.'']

'''Eyes:''' You caught me.

[''A strange shadow in an abstract form emerges from behind a tree branch.'']

'''Shadow:''' To you who stray so far from home. To me who's trapped beneath these bones. We'll play forever, me and you, when you paint the land in nine bright hues!

[''As they speak, the shadow moves around the room and transforms into multiple abstract picture forms. Eventually, after reaching the portal, the shadow transforms to depict 9 person lifting up their hands in a worshipping position. They then transform again to depict a screaming Titan and people being shattered into pieces. After that, they revert to their original form and start cackling.'']

'''Belos:''' What can I do for you, [[Collector]]?

[''The Collector moves towards a statue and lies down between its arms.'']

'''Collector:''' I'm bored! Is the [[Draining Spell]] ready yet? I wanna play and see everything go all... 

[''The Collector transforms themselves to wrap around the statue and then scream, eventually shattering into multiple pieces.'']

'''Belos:''' You'll have your fun on the [[Day of Unity]].

[''As he speaks, Belos turns around and walks away from the portal. The Collector appears on the door.'']

'''Collector:''' Betrayed, beguiled, alone, deceived! We'll have our revenge on... Ugh, "unity" is so hard to rhyme.

[''Luz and Hunter are bewildered by everything they have witnessed. Luz looks back and Hunter, and he can only shrug. Suddenly, a projection of Hunter from the past runs through Hunter, much to the duo's surprise. Hunter then clutches his chest in shock. Scene cuts to past Hunter going up stairs towards Belos, who is standing in front of the portal.'']

'''Past Hunter:''' I- I know you didn't want me going to [[Eclipse Lake (location)|Eclipse Lake]]. But if I hadn't, [''takes out the [[Portal Key|portal key]]''] I wouldn't have found this!

[''Belos immediately snatches the key away from Hunter's hand. He then holds up the key to take a closer look, and sees some [[Titan's Blood]] leaking out of it.'']

'''Past Hunter:''' Some... of the Titan blood did spill, but- but if you let me explain then-

'''Belos:''' [''sternly''] Leave. Now.

[''Past Hunter looks up at Belos sadly. Scene cuts to Belos standing in front of the portal as the sound of Past Hunter's footsteps becomes further away. Eventually, the sound of door closing can be heard. The Collector then emerges from behind the portal.'']

'''Collector:''' Ooh, you were maaaaad. I thought you were gonna go all...

[''The Collector transforms into an image depicting Belos with multiple tentacles, then scream and wave the tentacles around.'']

'''Collector:''' ...on that kid.

'''Belos:''' Not as long as he stays in the right path. I say, "The Titan has big plans for you," and he does what he's told. Unlike the previous attempts.

'''Collector:''' I'm starting to think you make those things just to destroy them. You have fun with it. Admit it! [''cackles'']

[''Cut to Hunter and Luz. Luz has a sad expression on her face while Hunter looks shocked.'']

'''Belos:''' Of course I don't, Collector. It hurts every time he chooses to betray me.

[''Luz turns around to look at Hunter.'']

[''Scene cuts to outside the memory. Kid Belos jumps out from the painting and runs off. Luz comes out, then helps Hunter out of the painting.'']

'''Luz:''' Sounds like he wants to wipe out all life in the [[Demon Realm]]. And the sigils help him do that.

[''As Luz speaks, Hunter walks away with a pained expression on his face while she follows him behind. Not far away from them, Kid Belos puts down some objects on the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' Hunter, um, listen. You don't need to return to the [[Emperor's Castle|castle]]. You can stay at the Owl House if you want. I'm sure Eda would be cool with it once we... tell her what we... heard.

[''Luz notices something in front of her and Hunter and becomes horrified. It is another part of Belos' memories, except this one has multiple broken Golden Guard masks on the ground. There are also some paintings on the trees depicting what happened to the previous Golden Guards. Luz suddenly hears something cracking and gasps, turning towards the source of sound. Behind her, Kid Belos is standing in a circle made out of rope and surrounded by multiple arrows and bottles of liquids. He breaks a Golden Guard mask in half and throws it into the fire.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey! Stop that!

[''As she speaks, Luz runs towards Kid Belos and drags him away from the fire. Hunter then proceeds to stomp out the fire.'']

'''Luz:''' Why would he do that?

[''Something floats past Hunter's foot, and he gets into a defensive posture. Multiple of those unknown substance float towards the rope circle then transforms into Inner Belos, who proceed to start screeching loudly. Luz and Hunter look at it in shock as it stomps on the ground.'']

'''"Inner Belos":''' Get away from him! Danger! Danger! Run!

'''Luz:''' [''shocked''] Are those... Palismen...?!

'''Hunter:''' [''realization''] We weren't running from the Inner Belos. He was with us, the whole time.

[''Behind the duo, Kid Belos is facing away from them and crying, but it soon turns into a maniacal laughter as he takes out a wooden sword and strikes the rope on the ground, transferring some sort of energy into the circle where the Palismen figure is at. This activates it and launches the bottles onto the figure. The rope then tightens around the figure, causing it to crash to the ground. Luz and Hunter turn around to look at Kid Belos, who proceeds to transform himself into Adult [[Inner Belos]].'']

'''Inner Belos:''' Hello, Hunter. Hello, Luz.

[''Scene changes to show Luz and Hunter looking at Inner Belos angrily.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' Ah. I was finally able to catch it. [''walks towards the figure''] This thing's been a thorn in my side for years. All these weepy Palismen souls... 

[''Inner Belos puts his hand on the figure, causing the figure to start turning into dust.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' Their voices constantly nagging me. [''grabs a bird Palisman from the pile''] Vile. But without them, I wouldn't be able to do THIS.

[''Inner Belos transforms his left arm into some sort of goo and squeezes the Palisman. Hunter's face is filled with shock and horror as Inner Belos proceeds to destroy the Palisman in front of him, causing him to wince.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' Ah... [''turns around''] I'm feeling better already. [''to Hunter''] Thank you for distracting it.

'''Hunter:''' [''on the verge of crying''] What did you do to the other guards...? To our family?! It wasn't wild magic, was it?

[''Inner Belos' face turns cold.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' [''flicks Hunter's hair''] What a shame!

[''Tears start forming in Hunter's eyes.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' [''exhales''] Out of all the Grimwalkers, you looked the most like him.

'''Hunter:''' [''confused and scared''] What...? 

[''Hunter suddenly gets dragged down into the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' Hunter!

[''Luz takes off her jacket and tosses it towards Hunter for him to grab on, but he still gets dragged downwards.'']

'''Luz:''' No, no, no!

[''Luz grabs onto her jacket trying to pull Hunter out, but she gets dragged towards him instead.'']

'''Luz:''' You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Just... hang on! Just...

[''Despite Luz's best efforts, Hunter still gets sucked into the ground along with her jacket. She falls towards the ground and lands on her knees and elbows.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' I was really expecting him to last longer than the others.

[''Luz turns towards Inner Belos angrily, with tears forming in her eyes.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm gonna tell EVERYONE about the Day of Unity, that you've been lying about the Titan for YEARS!!!

'''Inner Belos:''' Yes, this has gone on longer than I'd have liked. But... no one ever said being a witch hunter was easy.

'''Luz:''' [''incredulously''] Witch... hunter? So all this time, people have been mindlessly helping a WITCH HUNTER?! How could they be tricked so easily?

'''Inner Belos:''' I wouldn't be so judgmental, if I were you.

[''Inner Belos proceeds to summon a picture frame from the ground behind Luz. It then shows the moment when Red Fang tries to burn [[Philip Wittebane|Philip Wittebane's]] [[Philip Wittebane's diary|journal]].'']

'''Red Fang:''' His pretty little words should make pretty good kindling.

[''Luz is appalled by what she is seeing and pants heavily, mouth agape.'']

'''Past Luz:''' That doesn't belong to you.

'''Luz:''' No. No, no, no.

[''Scene cuts back to the picture frame showing the moment when Luz taught Philip how to use a [[Light Glyph|light glyph]].'']

'''Philip:''' Astounding!

[''Scene changes to show the moment when Philip, Luz and [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] are inside the Titan's head. Philip winces in pain and kneels down, holding onto his knee.'']

'''Past Luz:''' It's okay, we can help!

[''Scene changes to show the moment when the trio are inside the cave.'']

'''Past Luz:''' I know you want to get home, but nothing is worth hurting people!

[''Scene changes to show the moment when Philip summons the Collector after wiping his hand on the mirror he found in the cave.'']

'''Past Philip/Belos:''' I just need to live long enough to see this through.

[''Luz is in complete denial about this.'']

'''Luz:''' No, no, no! You're Belos! You're just Belos!!!

[''As she speaks, Luz breaks down in tears and grabs onto her hair, then drops to her knees.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' Please, do me a kindness, and call me by my real name.

'''Luz:''' [''weakly''] I... can't

[''Scene cuts to the picture frame showing the moment when Luz and Lilith approach Philip.'']

'''Past Luz:''' You're Philip Wittebane, aren't you?

[''Scene changes to show the moment when Luz gets excited at being able to taught Philip how to use a light glyph.'']

'''Past Luz:''' [''to Lilith, excitedly''] I can't believe I taught Philip something new!

[''Scene changes to show the moment when Luz and Lilith are in front of the double door inside the head of the Titan.'']

'''Past Luz:''' I'll go talk to Philip.

[''Scene changes to show the moment when Luz looks at Philip hesitantly after reading what he wrote in his journal.'']

'''Past Luz:''' [''hesitantly''] Philip, why did you bring us here?

[''As the scene is playing, Luz raises her head and looks up at Inner Belos with a morose expression on her face, blocking the view of the picture frame.'']

[''Scene cuts back to the living room of the Owl House. Eda uses a dropper to put a drop of liquid into another liquid inside a flask, but the reaction causes an eruption of gas.'']

'''Eda:''' [''angrily''] Bones, dirt, and muck! I don't have time to fail!

[''As she speaks, she frustratedly throws her flask onto the ground and breaks it, then knocks over her book stand. Someone suddenly knocks on the door, grabbing everyone's attention.'']

'''Hooty:''' Inopportune interruption, eh? [''deepens voice''] I'LL HANDLE THIS.

[''Hooty retracts outside. Eda picks up the book stand she just knocked over.'']

'''King:''' [''hesitantly''] Eda? Tell me it's... gonna be okay.

[''Eda doesn't reply and only looks at him with a worried expression.'']

'''Hooty:''' Eda! 

[''Eda looks up. Scene cuts to Hooty barging in through the window with a bouquet of flowers inside his mouth.'']

'''Hooty:''' Special delivery from a secret admirer!

[''Hooty puts the flowers inside a glass vase.'']

'''Eda:''' Hooty, that thing could be booby-trapped. Get it outta here.

[''The flowers suddenly starts floating and glows, surprising Hooty. The flowers then wilt, causing the petals to drop and the contents wrapped inside it to dissolve in the vase and create a yellow liquid. Eda picks up the note that comes with the flowers and reads it.'']

'''Eda:''' [''gasps''] It's the teleportation potion into the mindscape! But who would...

[''Eda walks over to the window and looks outside, in time to see someone disappear behind a rock.'']

'''King:''' Figure it out later. Now we can save Luz.

'''Eda:''' Hold up. [''reads the note''] It says it still needs a power source. And a big one.

[''King thinks for a bit, then runs to grab [[Amity Blight|Amity's]] glove and offers it to Eda.'']

'''King:''' Use this!

'''Eda:''' But... that's the last of Luz's [[Titan's Blood|Titan Blood]]. She needs it to get back [[Human Realm|home]]!

'''King:''' She'll never get home if she doesn't get back here!

[''Eda grabs the glove from King's hand and stares at it hesitantly.'']

[''Scene cuts back inside Belos's mindscape. Luz backs up from Inner Belos and trips over, not knowing that she has dropped her walkie-talkie. Just then, Eda's voice rings out from the walkie-talkie.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] Kid, you there? We're getting you two out.

'''Inner Belos:''' It does feel good to hear another human say that name. I had to change it when Philip was run out of too many towns. 

[''As he speaks, he slowly walks towards Luz who backs up with a frightened expression on her face. She then accidentally falls backwards and rolls down a slope.''] 

'''Inner Belos:''' I told you once before... ''Luzura''.

[''Luz stands up as Inner Belos approaches her.''] 

'''Inner Belos:''' Perhaps... [''morphs into Philip'']

'''Inner Philip:''' ...we were destined to meet. [''walks away'']

'''Luz:''' And what about Hunter? What's a Grimwalker? 

[''Philip morphs back into Inner Belos.'']

'''Inner Belos:''' He's... a better version of an old friend. But, thanks to you, I'll have to make another one.

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] She's not answering! Luz? Luz!

'''Luz:''' But... why? Why go through all this?

'''Inner Belos:''' [''grabs a Golden Guard mask and holds it triumphantly''] I'll do anything to save humanity from evil.

'''Luz:''' [''slowly shakes her head''] No.

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] Luz, we're gonna start the countdown. Are you ready?

'''Luz:''' ''You're'' evil.

'''Inner Belos:''' Can't reason with crazy. 

[''He throws his arm, which has morphed into a pickaxe, towards Luz. She covers herself with her arms and screams in fright, when suddenly, a barricade of vines and an ice pillar shield her and block Inner Belos's attack. When Luz opens her eyes, she is shocked to find the barricade, and the arm-pickaxe has barely passed above her head. Scene then pans to Hunter, who is revealed to have summoned the vines and ice pillars and is grabbing onto a thorn.'']

'''Hunter:''' Luz!

[''Hunter turns around with one hand grabbing onto the thorn along with Eda's letterman jacket, and the other one holding onto some glyphs, with a few of them falling to the ground.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] Five...

[''Luz grabs a fire glyph from the floor as she and Hunter run towards the walkie-talkie.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] Four...

[''Luz summons a whirlwind of fire from the fire glyph to create a hole in the barricade which she and Hunter pass through.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] Three...

[''The whirlwind of fire damages and destroys Inner Belos's arm-pickaxe as he retracts his arm in pain. Luz and Hunter run past him.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] Two...

[''Hunter and Inner Belos stare at each other for the last time as Hunter is pulled away by Luz.'']

'''Eda:''' [''from the walkie-talkie''] One!

[''Luz and Hunter reach the walkie-talkie as Luz makes a dive for it.'']

'''Luz:''' EDA, NOW, PLEASE, NOW!!!

[''A burst of light envelopes Luz and Hunter. Scene cuts to outside the Owl House. The ground rumbles and multiple beams of light flashes through the gaps of the barricaded windows. Scene cuts to the living room as Luz and Hunter emerge in a puff of smoke. Cut to King, Eda, Flapjack and Hooty looking down at them as King and Hooty attempt to approach the duo.'']

'''Eda:''' [''blocks King and Hooty''] Don't crowd them! [''to Luz and Hunter''] Are you two okay?

[''Luz sits up and gives the gang a blank stare. As Hunter sits up, Flapjack immediately flies to him, pecks his head and chirps happily.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''gasps''] He knows. He... he knows we were in there. I can't... I can't go back! 

[''Hunter starts panicking and breathing heavily.'']

'''Eda:''' [''alarmed''] Kid, breathe.

[''She offers her hand to Hunter, but he fearfully backs away. He then looks down at his cloak and immediately takes if off, throwing it to the ground. Scene cuts to outside the house. The door is burst open as Hunter runs away tearfully. Luz attempts to chase after him but then stops.'']

'''Luz:''' Hunter! 

[''Flapjack chirps and flies after him. King, Eda and Hooty then come out of the house, looking worried.'']

'''King:''' What the heck happened in there?

'''Eda:''' Luz, what did you see?

[''Luz's expression worsens as she looks back at the gang regretfully, tears forming in her eyes.'']

'''[[Kikimora]]:''' The [[Day of Unity]] approaches, where we'll celebrate the purification of magic under the coven system, just as [[the Titan]] intended. As heads of the nine covens, we celebrate your efforts to complete this plan. For this, you have earned a glimpse of the reward that awaits.

'''[[Emperor Belos]]:''' Step forward. The larger your covens grow, the more power we have to unite our realms, where the worthy shall inherit an utopia free of wild magic.  

[''Emperor Belos grunts in pain and clutches his chest. The [[Hunter|Golden Guard]] helps Belos up from his throne. Kikimora attempts to follow, but the Golden Guard stops her.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' No. Stay here. I can handle this alone.

[''Kikimora glares at the Golden Guard as they walk away. When they are alone, Emperor Belos transforms into some kind of sludge monster. He then proceeds to punch the wall repeatedly, until he slowly backs away, and puts his mask back on. The Golden Guard hands him a [[Witch's Staff]]. He quickly breaks it and absorbs the green essence through his eyes which turn green before changing back to blue.'']

'''Emperor Belos:''' [''sighs''] I need more. [''reaches out''] 

'''Golden Guard:''' That was the last from our reserves. The Palistrom wood has been overharvested.  

[''Emperor Belos turns away.'']  

'''Golden Guard:''' Uncle, let me help! We can make more Palismen! Actually, I read about this technique: harnessing wild magic to-  

[''Emperor Belos stares back at him.'']  

'''Golden Guard:''' Uh...sorry.

'''Emperor Belos:''' [''places a hand on Golden Guard's shoulder''] Please, be careful. Our family is gone because of wild magic. I can't let the same happen to you.  

[''Cut to outside the throne room. Kikimora is shown listening in on them.'']  

'''Emporer Belos:''' [''from behind the door''] Find me more Palismen. I can depend on you, right?  

[''Narrowing her eyes, Kikimora runs off.'']

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-'''

[''Open in [[Luz Noceda|Luz]]'s room, where the [[Echo Mouse|echo mouse]] is seen resting in a terrarium. Luz, in pajamas, looks at it.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh, little echo mouse. You ate the diary that can get me home. Can't you cough up a teeny bit?

'''[[King]]:''' Just squeeze it out! [''grunts as he squeezes his teddy bear so hard, the head pops off'']

'''Luz:''' Hmm. Maybe I just need to be patient? [''presses her face on the glass and whispers''] Please tell me your secrets.

'''[[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]]:''' [''enters, wearing a blazer''] Hey, knucklehead. You're gonna be late for school.  

[''Luz doesn't respond, focused on the echo mouse.''] 

'''Eda:''' Aright. I guess you won't be getting a magic staff with your classmates.

[''As soon as she finishes that sentence, Luz zooms out of the room dressed for school and waiting at the front door.'']

'''Luz:''' Come on, Eda. We gotta fly!

'''Eda:''' There we go.  

[''Eda walks out the door. Luz quickly follows after and shuts the door behind them.'']

[''Switch to [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]] [[grudgby]] field, where several students have gathered and a large object rests in front of them. Eda and [[Principal Bump]] are also there.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey, [[Willow Park|Willow]]. Shouldn't [[Amity Blight|Amity]] be here?

'''Willow:''' Oh, sorry, Luz. I heard she stayed home today.

'''Luz:''' Oh. [''chuckles''] That actually makes sense. [''looks down, saddened'']

'''Principal Bump:''' Good tidings on this momentous day.You're all about to recieve your witches' staffs and, more importantly, meet your [[Palisman]]. This is a crucial step in your magical development. Palismen are lifelong partners. They can be both your good friends and a powerful tool. In my case...

[''Bump snaps his fingers and [[Frewin]] opens his eyes, jumps off his head and turns into a staff, revealing Bump's body length black hair and the scar on his right eye, his left one closed.'']

[''The class gasps in awestruck.'']  

'''Luz:''' Holy Titan!

'''Principal Bump:''' ...Frewin here, helps me see.

'''Eda:''' [''stepping forward''] Now, traditionally, young witches carve their staffs from the branch of an old Palistrom tree.

'''Principal Bump:''' But sadly, Palistrom trees are becoming more rare. And those that remain are guarded covetously.

'''Eda:''' That's why I've teamed up with Bumpipoo...

'''Principal Bump:''' Never call me that.

'''Eda:''' ...to bring you...

[''The [[Bat Queen]] flies down and lands on the object.'']

'''Bat Queen:''' Palisman adoption day!

'''Luz:''' They're so cute!

'''Eda:''' Thanks for the favor BQ. Here's your whistle back.

'''Bat Queen:''' Save it for another time. This was my pleasure. What a wonderful idea. 

[''One of the palismen, [[Flapjack]] escapes the shelter, but Bump picks them up and puts them back.'']

'''Principal Bump:''' Nope! You're staying right here.

'''Luz:''' Aw. Little rascal!

'''Bat Queen:''' These little ones have not had homes in many years. They want to feel a connection. Kneel and state your deepest wish, and your like-minded partner will find you.

'''[[Boscha]]:''' [''rolls eyes''] Ugh, I want my own Palisman, not some trashy hand-me-down.

'''Willow:''' Your loss! [''shoves Boscha as she runs up to the nest''] I want to be strong and wise to protect everyone I love. And if anyone gets in my way, they'll feel the sting of defeat.

'''Bat Queen:''' Tender yet tenacious. [[Clover]] gives her support. 

[''Clover, a bee palisman, flies out of the shelter and over to Willow. She chitters.'']

'''Willow:''' Oh! [''Clover transforms into a staff''] Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna take such good care of you.

'''[[Gus Porter|Gus]]:''' Beautiful. Just beautiful.

'''Boscha:''' [''pushes Willow''] Outta my way! I want to play professional grudgby!

'''Bat Queen:''' [''chuckles''] A competitive spirit. Maya will be thrilled. 

[''Maya, a crab palisman, hops up to Boscha and becomes her staff.'']

'''Boscha:''' [''blushing''] Okay. This is pretty cool.

'''[[Viney]]:''' I want to open my own veterinary clinic for mythical pets. 

[''A manticore palisman rises and becomes her staff.''] 

'''Viney:''' [''gasps, chuckles''] All right!

'''Gus:''' [[Perry Porter|Dad]] wants me to become a master illusionist, but that's easy. So instead, I'll become an ambassador to the human realm and re-establish contact with the giraffes! 

[''A blue chameleon palisman climbs up to Gus and becomes his staff.'']

'''Pufferfish Guy:''' I just want to make it to graduation. 

[''Puffeefish Guy then sees a sloth palisman hanging on his arm, which turns into his staff.''] 

'''Pufferfish Guy:''' [''gasps, chuckles''] Yes!

'''The Class:''' [''murmurs''] Oh wow!

[''Everyone watches Luz as she takes her turn.'']

'''Luz:''' I want to be a witch! [''none of the Palismen approach her''] Uh... probably just takes a little longer 'cause I'm a human, right?

'''Bat Queen:''' Palismen bond through emotion. I do not sense any conviction from you.

'''Luz:''' That's impossible. I'm Luz, I'm chock full of conviction!

'''Principal Bump:''' Perhaps specificity would help. There are many kinds of witches. What do you hope to accomplish with your magic?

'''Luz:''' Oh, uh... get home to my mom?

'''Gus:''' Would you still train to be a witch in the human realm?

'''Boscha:''' Can you even do magic there?

'''Luz:''' Huh, I guess I never thought that far ahead.

'''Eda:''' You okay, Luz? 

[''Cut to the Owl House at nighttime. Luz is pacing around her room.'']

'''Luz:''' I stayed here because I wanted to learn magic, right? I wanted to be a witch like Eda and [[Azura]]. But what does that even mean? And I read stories like this. The main character always has to return home, and what? Did I expect to be a witch back in Connecticut? [''groans''] Mmm. Yeah, I wouldn't want to be my palisman either.  

[''Outside her door, Eda and King listen in, share a look and leave. Soon after, Flapjack hops out of Luz's bag.'']

'''Luz:''' It's you! Did you come here for me?  

[''Flapjack hops around Luz's room.'']  

'''Luz:''' No. Of course not. Come on, little dude.  

[''Luz grabs her cape and runs out.'']

[''Cut to Hexside grudgby field. Luz stops in front of the palismen shelter, and touches the force shield covering it.'']

'''Luz:''' How are we supposed to get through this?  

[''Flapjack presses against the force field, causing it to disappear.'']  

'''Luz:''' Ooh, palismen powers. Neat! 

[''Luz opens the door to let Flapjack in, waking all the other palismen inside.'']  

'''Luz:''' Aw. [''closes the door''] All right. I'm not leaving here until I figure out what my future is, and one of you becomes my palismen! What if... I use my powers to become a popular magician back in the human realm? No, I'm horrible at card tricks. What if... [''picks up Flapjack''] I stay on the Boiling Isles, and become a rugged bounty hunter? Nah, I'm too lovable. Oh! If I go back... 

[''Time passes. All the palismen are sleeping, and Luz laying is down with them. She yawns.''] 

'''Luz:''' [''sleepily''] What if... I open a magic pet shop, but it's password protected. The password is, "You're a little angel."  

[''Flapjack chrips back. Suddenly, the palismen shelter is lifted off the ground by something. Luz opens the door.''] 

'''Luz:''' Hey, we're a little busy in... here?

[''Luz sees that they are no longer on ground and gasps. She looks up to see that an airship is carrying them. Cut to closeup of her shocked reaction. Cut to black.''] 

'''Luz:''' [''to the palismen''] I think we're being kidnapped!

[''All the palismen start whimpering and shivering in fear''.]  

'''Luz:''' Don't worry. I'll figure this out. 

[''Luz uses a plant glyph to climb onto the airship, and sees the Golden Guard steering.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' [''whistling'']

'''Luz:''' Ugh, him again. 

[''Luz sneaks up behind the Golden Guard, and slaps a fire glyph on his back.'']

'''Luz:''' Hi-yah!

'''Golden Guard:''' Huh? [''screams as he rockets off of the airship'']

'''Luz:''' He'll be fine. Okay, how do I land this thing? Huh.

'''Golden Guard:''' Oh, you just pull that cord above your head.

'''Luz:''' Thank y--eh?! 

[''The Golden Guard has returned and is lying on the dashboard.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Hiiiii.

[''The Golden Guard fires a spell to tie Luz up with ropes, which knocks her off her feet.'']

'''Luz:''' Wha- Hey!

'''Golden Guard:''' Good to see you too, human.

'''Luz:''' Why are you stealing palismen, Golden Guard?

'''Golden Guard:''' Frankly, [''teleports over to Luz''] You should be more concerned about yourself. For the crime of rocketing me off my own ship, you'll be locked in the dingiest cell in the [[Conformatorium]], for the rest of your sad little life. 

'''Luz:''' [''scoffs''] Whatever. I broke out of there like, twice.

'''Golden Guard:''' Then we'll just zap you to dust and throw you into the sea. That better?  

[''Luz pouts and grumbles in response.''] 

'''Golden Guard:''' Good. 

[''The Golden Guard returns to steering the airship. Luz looks at the deck, which has scuff marks. Getting an idea, she starts drawing a glyph with her foot.'']

'''Luz:''' Say, how did you get back on the ship so fast?

'''Golden Guard:''' Staff.

'''Luz:''' Cool.  

[''Luz activates the ice glyph, and it sends the Golden Guard's staff flying off the airship.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' No!

[''Luz chuckles, giving off a smug expression.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' [''chuckles''] Human, it'll take more than that to thwart my mission.  

[''Suddenly, a [[Kikimora's Hand Dragon|hand dragon]] lands on the airship and roars.'']

'''Luz:''' What is that?  

[''The dragon proceeds to rip the airship's balloon, causing Luz and the Golden Guard to fall from the sky. Luz and the Golden Guard both scream as the airship crashes. Cut to black.'']

[''Cut to a shot of Luz regaining consciousness after the crash. Flapjack chrips as he pecks at the ropes tied around her.'']

'''Luz:''' Huh? Little rascal?  

[''The ropes around Luz break, freeing her.''] 

'''Luz:''' Oh, thank you. [''groans''] My head!

[''Luz finds the Golden Guard's staff, and grasps it in her hands. She hears him groaning, and sees his unconscious body nearby.'']  

'''[[Guard Captain]]:''' Kikimora, ma'am.  

[''Luz turns the other way when she overhears speaking.''] 

'''Guard Captain:''' We found the palismen. They seem rattled but unharmed. 

[''Luz peeks out behind a rock, watching Kikimora and the Guard Captain talk. Kikimora is holding the Golden Guard's helmet behind her back.'']

'''Kikimora:''' Very good, Captain. Return to the city and prepare them for travel.

'''Guard Captain:''' Is it true, ma'am? Is the Golden Guard really...

'''Kikimora:''' [''holds up the Golden Guard's helmet''] This is all that remains.  

'''Guard Captain:''' [''gasps''] 

'''Kikimora:''' Such a horrible accident. [''shakes head''] Probably caused by the incompetent pilot.

'''Guard Captain:''' I'll... alert the castle. Scouts! To [[Latissa]]! 

[''The Guard Captain and the Coven scouts leave the scene. Once alone, Kikimora blows on a whistle, summoning the same dragon that caused the ship to crash.'']

'''Kikimora:''' [''pets her dragon''] Excellent work, my pet.

'''Luz:''' [''gasps'']

'''Kikimora:''' [''holds up the Golden Guard's helmet for her dragon''] Now, find the rest of him and have yourself a nice little snack.  

[''Her dragon eats the Golden Guard's mask.'']  

'''Kikimora:''' I'll call for you soon.

[''Kikimora leaves. Luz and Flapjack look back at the Golden Guard. Flapjack chrips.'']

'''Luz:''' Don't worry. I won't leave him. 

[''Flapjack hops onto Luz's shoulder. They walk over to the unmasked Golden Guard. Cut to a closeup of his unmasked face.'']

'''Luz:''' This is the Golden Guard?

[''Cut to a shot of Luz looking down at him.'']

'''Luz:''' It looks like he could be a student at Hexside.  

[''Luz slowly leans near the Golden Guard, then slaps him in the face.'']

'''Luz:''' Wake up!

'''Golden Guard:''' [''jumps awake; yells''] Wha- you!

'''Luz:''' Shh! [''puts hand over the Golden Guard's mouth to silence him''] Listen. You are a bad person, and I do not like you. But Kikimora is trying to kill you and unfortunately, I'm too nice to let that happen!

[''Luz removes her hand from his mouth in disgust, revealing that it is covered in slobber.''] 

'''Luz:''' Ugh, are you licking my hand?! [''puts her saliva covered hand in his face''] I'm trying to help you!

'''Golden Guard:''' Why should I believe you? [''puts hand in Luz's face'']

'''Luz:''' Because... [''grunts'']

[''They stop fighting when they hear Kikimora's dragon return. Her dragon spots the Golden Guard's cloak and devours it as Luz and the Golden Guard sneak away from the scene.'']

[''The duo walk to the town of Latissa, the Golden Guard taking the lead.'']

'''Luz:''' Whew, man, Kikimora must hate you. Whoa! I haven't been outside Bonesborough that much, Latissa is so cool! Wait! Where are you going? Hey man, I just saved your life, the least you could do is tell me your name. 

[''The Golden Guard huffs at her, and goes over to Police Precinct 206. Luz gasps. The Golden Guard approaches scouts.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Scouts! Direct me to your communications room. I need to contact the castle immediately.  

[''The Golden Guard slides down his glove, showing the scouts his Emperor's Coven tattoo.'']

'''Emperor's Coven Scout 1:''' Cute. I didn't know kids your age were still into temporary tattoos.

'''Emperor's Coven Scout 2:''' Yeah, show us your badge number.

'''Golden Guard:''' I am your superior, and I can prove it! [''turns to Luz''] Staff.

'''Luz:''' Hmm? 

[''Luz hides the staff behind her back.'']

'''Emperor's Coven Scout 2:''' Isn't it a little late for you kids to be outside?

'''Emperor's Coven Scout 1:''' Yeah, go home before we call your parents.

[''The Golden Guard glares angrily at Luz, and starts to chase her. Luz runs through townspeople.'']

'''Luz:''' Uh, excuse me. Sorry. 

[''A cat yowls and hisses at them. The Golden Guard shoves it out of the way, making it fall down. Luz pushes down a garbage can, and the Golden Guard jumps over it. She leaps over a ledge, and falls on a set of stairs, spilling eyeballs out of one the monter's baskets.'']

'''Luz:''' Sorry. 

[''Shortly after, the Golden Guard lands on his feet, and continues chasing her. Luz turns and runs down an alleyway. She stops and quickly begins to draw an ice glyph in the dirt. The Golden Guard arrives and runs towards her. She activates the ice glyph.'']

'''Luz:''' Ice glyph!  

[''Luz launches herself onto the top of a building. She looks over the edge to see the Golden Guard standing, not doing anything.'']

'''Luz:''' Come on, Golden Guard. Don't you know any, like, levitation spells?

[''The Golden Guard glares at Luz, then looks away.'']

'''Luz:''' [''points at his staff''] Are you powerless without this?

[''The Golden Guard walks away. He then leaps onto different objects to get on top of the building. He then dodges Luz's energy beam attacks from his staff.'']

'''Luz:''' Back up, or--or else!

'''Golden Guard:''' Or else what? [''walks towards Luz''] Gonna blast me to bits? [''chuckles''] Nah, you're too nice for that. Fly away? Uh-uh, you know you can't do that either. 'Cause then you'll be leaving behind your precious palismen. You don't tend to think things through, do you human?

[''Luz bites her lip. Kikimora's dragon lands at Police Precinct 206.''] 

'''Golden Guard:''' So Kikimora was after my catch.

'''Luz:''' Seems like neither of us want her to win right now. So, let's work together to take back those palismen.

'''Golden Guard:''' Then what? You think I'll just let you walk away with them?

'''Luz:''' Maybe you won't have a choice! [''spins the Golden Guard's staff around''] I'm more formidable than you think. [''almost drops it over the edge, but catches it'']

'''Golden Guard:''' I doubt that, but fine. A truce till then.

'''Luz:''' [''extends her hand''] Truce!  

[''When the Golden Guard reaches to shake it, she takes her hand away''.] 

'''Luz:''' Too slow. [''runs off chuckling''] 

[''Cut to a shot of the Golden Guard's displeased reaction.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' [''grunts''] Let's just get this over with...

[''Cut to black. Return to the Golden Guard as he sneaks down to ground level to steal something in a bag. He climbs back up the building and sees Luz drawing two connected glyphs.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Huh, I've never seen magic like this. What will it do?

'''Luz:''' Well, we don't want to spook Kikimora's steed, because it might drop the nest and hurt the palismen! So, using these fire and ice spells, I can command the glyphs to produce a thick mist!

'''Golden Guard:''' And the sleeping nettles?

'''Luz:''' They're essential! Combined with the magic mist, it'll create-

'''Golden Guard:''' A sleep-inducing smoke, forcing Kikimora to land.

[''Luz looks at him surprised.''] 

'''Golden Guard:''' Oh, um, I-- I-I read a similar spell in ''Bones to Earth''-

'''Luz:''' -''A Study of Wild Magic''! Eda once pickpocketed the guy who wrote it.

'''Golden Guard:''' I've never seen glyphs before, but, it seems very similar to the elemental magic practiced in the [[The Savage Ages|Savage Ages]].

'''Luz:''' Really?

'''Golden Guard:''' Actually, not many people know this, but... [''stops''] No. No, no, no, no. This stuff is restricted for a reason. You should forget about it before you're hurt. 

'''Luz:''' Uh huh... Other than [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]], I've never spoken to someone inside the Emperor's Coven. What made you want to join?

'''Golden Guard:''' [''sighs, leans against the wall''] You were right before. I'm a powerless witch. A lot of my ancestors were. I never thought I'd have a future in a world like this. But then, Belos found me and gave me a staff with artificial magic. He said the Titan had big plans for me.

'''Luz:''' At least you have your future figured out now.

'''Golden Guard:''' At least you can figure out your own.  

[''Flapjack hops toward him and pecks his leg''.] 

'''Golden Guard:''' Hey! Stop, get away from me!

'''Luz:''' He's just being friendly.

'''Golden Guard:''' I don't care! These things are made from wild magic. It's dangerous.

'''Luz:''' And does he look dangerous to you?

[''Kikimora's dragon flies into the air.'']

'''Luz:''' Masks on. 

[''Luz and the Golden Guard both put on their masks.''] 

'''Luz:''' Once they're surrounded by the smoke, we'll need to stay close to see where they land.  

[''The Golden Guard nods. Luz offers the staff back to the Golden Guard.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Are you sure?

'''Luz:''' Just take it! 

[''Kikimora's dragon flies overhead. Luz activates the connected glyphs. After, she gets on the Golden Guard's staff, to go after the dragon. Kikimora and her dragon both get sleepy.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' I think it's working.

[''Luz activates a light glyph to lead Kikimora in their direction.'']

'''Kikimora:''' Stop! 

[''Kikimora's dragon crashes onto the ground and falls asleep. Kikimora herself is thrown off the saddle and lands on the ground. Luz and the Golden Guard land.'']

'''Luz:''' The palismen! 

[''Luz runs toward the palismen to check on them.''] 

'''Luz:''' Hello, babies. Aw, you guys must be so cold and scared. Here, [''takes off her cap''] make sure you share. Now, stay in here, okay? We'll get you home safe and-  

[''The Golden Guard points his staff at Luz.'']  

'''Luz:''' [''nervous chuckle''] Right, I didn't think this through. Again. 

[''Luz shuts the palismen shelter's door and stands, staring at the Golden Guard, upset.''] 

'''Luz:''' So you're really gonna do this? You're just gonna hand all these innocent little guys over to Belos? I know what he does with them. I thought you might've been a good guy. But I guess that was just wishful thinking. You're not my friend, you're just the Golden Guard.

[''After a moment, the Golden Guard shows signs of wavering before taking his mask off.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' My name is Hunter.

[''Luz gasps. At that moment, Hunter's hit by an energy bolt fired by a drowsy Kikimora.'']

'''Kikimora:''' I can't tell who's there, but I know I've got you! [''keeps shooting magic at them''] 

[''Hunter defends Luz from another energy bolt. He and Kikimora fight. Her whistle falls off her neck during the fight. Luz picks up the whistle, and Kikimora attempts to fire at her again, but Hunter shoves her back.''] 

'''Kikimora:''' This is treason against a Coven official! 

[''Cut to Kikimora's blurry POV shot. Hunter pats out the tiny flame in his forelock.''] 

'''Kikimora:''' I will have your head! 

[''Kikimora continues firing magic at Hunter, who keeps deflecting her attacks. In the background, Luz run over to Kikimora's dragon and gets on them.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey... [''chuckles''] ...good thingy. The Boiling Isles will never stop surprising me.  

[''Luz blows the whistle, waking the dragon. It flies into the night sky. Hunter deflects another attacked from Kikimora, which knocks her unconscious. Hunter looks up at Luz and the dragon. Luz looks back before turning around, disappointment on her face.'']

[''Cut to morning at the grudgby field. The Bat Queen lands on the field.''] 

'''Principal Bump:''' Good morning, Bat Queen. The palismen are all accounted for. Although, I don't know where that thing came from...

[''Principal Bump points to Kikimora's dragon, sleeping. Flapjack chirps and hops up to the Bat Queen.'']

'''Bat Queen:''' You found someone after all this time? Go then.  

[''Flapjack flies off''.]

[''Cut to the Owl House, where Luz collapses onto her sleeping bag and looks at a framed photo of her with her mom.'']

'''Luz:''' [''sighs''] Everyone got one except me, huh? Maybe I wasn't meant to be here. [''she turns her head only to turn it back when light shines from her window finding...''] Eda!

[''Eda is perched on her windowsill sporting a massive proud smile on her face.'']

'''Eda:''' I'd thought I'd find you here.

'''King:''' [''climbs in''] We could've used the door!

'''Luz:''' What did you get into?  

[''Eda tosses a small log to her.'']  

'''Luz:''' [''confused''] Whew. Uh, how... thoughtful?

'''Eda:''' It's palistrom wood, ya ding-dong!

'''King:''' Now you can make your own palismen!

'''Luz:''' But-- But how? Isn't this super rare?

'''Eda:''' Let's just say that the Bonesborough Garden Club--

'''King:''' Was robbed! By us! 

[''Eda gives Luz a thumbs up.'']

'''Luz:''' I don't know what to say...

'''Eda:''' [''puts hand on Luz's shoulder''] No pressure, but whenever you know what you want, we'll start carving.

'''Luz:''' If it's okay, I'd like some time to think. It's hard to picture my future without seeing my mom.

'''Eda:''' Eh, there's no rush. Just know that whatever you need from us, we gotcha.

'''Luz:''' [''smiles''] Thanks.  

[''Luz puts the wood in her summer camp bag.'']

[''Cut to Hunter kneeling in the Emperor's throne room. He's back in uniform but lacks his helmet.''] 

'''Emperor Belos:''' So, you return with nothing. [''stands''] Is this the thanks I get for taking you in?

'''Hunter:''' Of course not. I want to help. A-A-And if you told me how wild magic did this to you, I might be able to find a--

[''Belos aims a sharp spike that barely misses Hunter's ear.'']  

'''Hunter:''' My apologies. I spoke out of turn. It won't happen again.

'''Emperor Belos:''' [''clutches his chest''] These outbursts are painful [''his eyes glow blue''] and so is watching you fail. I know you can do better, Hunter.

[''Outside, Kikimora is approaching the doors to the room when Hunter steps out, causing her to stop.'']

'''Kikimora:''' [''gasps''] Golden Guard? Y-You're alive! I mean, I heard about the crash in Latissa.

'''Hunter:''' Luckily, some travelers picked me up out of the wreckage. So I'm actually doing great. Looks like you had a rough night though. [''walks off'']

[''Kikimora seethes, but notices Hunter's singed hair: realizing he was her attacker, she glares at him. Cut to Hunter's room. He walks over to his bed and lies down.'']

'''Hunter:''' I can help, if I just knew a little more...

[''Flapjack chirps. Hunter sits up and sees Flapjack at the windowsil.'']

'''Hunter:''' Palisman! [''clutches Flapjack'']

[''Hunter squeezes him, Flapjack chrips. Hunter then lets him go.'']

'''Hunter:''' Oh! Sorry. [''frowns, pets Flapjack''] You shouldn't be here. It'd be bad if Belos saw you.  

[''Flapjack into a staff, which falls into Hunter's hands.''] 

'''Hunter:''' Oh! I was not expecting that.  

[''Hunter walks over to the window with his new staff, and gazes longingly.'']

[''The scene opens with total darkness.'']

'''Young [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]]:''' [''narrating''] It always starts the same way.

[''A young Eda suddenly gasps and sits up, panting.'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''narrating''] I wake up someplace dark.

[''Eda finds herself in a shadowy void. She stands up and looks around with a frightened expression. A shadow flashes past behind her. She turns around to look at it.'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''narrating''] And then ''it'' appears.

[''The [[Owl Beast]] appears. It steps on the ground, causing it to shake. It then stretches its neck towards Eda, stops in front of her, and screeches. Eda cries out in surprise, then turns around and runs away, panting and crying. The scene then transitions into her in her room. She is sitting on her bed, telling this to a healer from the Healing Coven and her mother.'']

'''Young Eda:''' And eventually I wake up and I know I turned into that thing.

'''Healer:''' I see. Here, take this. [''hands over a large gem to Eda''] It will tell you when the beast's energy is bubbling to the surface. Also, I hear gems are quite fashionable for young witches.

'''[[Gwendolyn Clawthorne|Gwendolyn]]:''' Oh, what a beautiful little stone. [''to the Healer''] May I speak with you outside? [''ushers him outside''] Just a minute, hon.

[''Edas mom closes the door. Outside the room, she starts scolding the healer. Eda gets up and eavesdrops on their conversation behind the door.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' What the heck was that? I thought you were in the Healing Coven, not the Bauble Brigade.

'''Healer:''' Mrs. Clawthorne, we have never seen a curse quite like this. I'm not sure it can be healed. Perhaps if we consult the Potions Coven, they may know a way to keep it at bay.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Keep it at bay? Oh, no. My daughter is suffering and I want that thing out! Cut it out if you have to.

[''Upon hearing that, Eda gasps and covers her mouth. She pants and clutches her chest. Then, she looks up and notices that her window is open. The wind blows, causing it to swing and squeak.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''pushes door open''] Edalyn, I'm taking you to someone else. [''looks up''] Huh?

[''Gwendolyn notices the open window. Scene then cuts to Eda running through a forest. She eventually stops to catch her breath, then starts walking while looking around.'']

'''Young Eda:''' I never knew this was back here.

[''Eda trips over something and falls down''. ''She turns around to see what made her fell.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Huh?

[''Eda notices a suitcase-like thing buried in the sand. She picks it up and wipes off the dirt on its surface, revealing an eye shape. The eye then flashes, and the suitcase flies off Edas hand. It folds open, with a [[Portal Key|key]] turning the lock, unlocking it. A door then opens, revealing it to be a [[Portal|portal]] leading to an unknown realm.'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''squints''] What?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''distant''] Edalyn! Edalyn, is that you?

[''Eda hesitates, then runs through the portal. The portal folds up and disappears. Gwendolyn comes out from behind a bush.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''looks around''] Edalyn! Edalyn!

[''Gwendolyn stops. She looks down with a sad expression, then looks up to her right with a determined expression.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' I will find a way to cure you, Edalyn. No matter what it takes.

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|OPENING THEME]]-'''

[''Back at the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] in the present. An alarm clock is screaming. Eda grabs it and throws it at the wall, destroying it. She gets out from her nest, goes up to her mirror, and screws in her fake gold fang. After that, she shaves feathers off her leg. She then opens a cupboard stocked up with [[Elixir|elixirs]]. She takes one out, drinks it and blaghs. Back in her room, she puts on a new dress and tears part of it off.'']

'''Eda:''' Ah, there we go. Mama like.

[''At the kitchen, [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] sleeps with her head atop a pile of books while snoring.'']

'''Eda:''' Beans!

[''Luz jolts up, cries out and falls backwards.'']

'''Eda:''' We ran out of [[Apple Blood|apple blood]]. [''kicks the fridge door close and turns around''] Still no luck?

'''Luz:''' [''gets up''] None. And I was up all night. I read every tome, book, notepad, and tea leaf. [''shows Eda a cup, with the tea leaf forming into a shrugging person''] But nothing explains how to make a portal to the Human Realm.

'''Eda:''' I wish I could help ya, kid. My door was already pretty old when I found it.

'''Luz:''' How long did you have it?

'''Eda:''' Well...

[''From somewhere, [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] starts screaming. Both Eda and Luz gasp. They run to the living room, just in time to see Lilith beginning to turn into her beast form.'']

'''Lilith:''' Help... me.

[''Eda rushes over and takes out a bottle of elixir from beneath a pillow on the couch. She then runs towards Lilith.'']

'''Eda:''' Calm down, just calm down. [''feeds Lilith the elixir''] The curse acts stronger when you're stressed.

[''Liliths feathers disappear.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''pants''] That was horrible. How have you managed all these years?

'''Eda:''' Well, it's been hard. [''helps Lilith up''] But since we split the curse, at least the elixirs are working again.

'''Lilith:''' That's a relief.

[''Lilith notices her left hand gone. She makes a terrified noise while Luz cries out in shock.'']

'''Eda:''' [''bends down to pick up Liliths hand''] Oh, yeah, sorry. Side effect of the curse. It's actually fun once in a while. [''sets the hand back in place''] Now don't worry. I've stashed elixirs all over the house. [''reveals hidden elixirs under the couch seat, behind a flower pot and pulls one out of Luz's hood''] Whenever you start feeling feathery, just help yourself to one of these bad boys.

'''Luz:''' [''claps hand''] Ooh!

'''Lilith:''' [''regretfully''] I had no idea this is what I did to you. I am so, so sorry.

'''Eda:''' Eh, at least I got company now. [''hands Lilith a bottle of elixir''] And you got me if you need anything.

[''Eda pats on Liliths shoulder and walks out. Lilith then lies down on the couch, and notices a few bottle of elixirs taped to the ceiling.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''smiles''] Hmm.

[''Scene cuts to Eda and Luz outside the Owl House. Luz walks up to Eda.'']

'''Eda:''' As I was saying, I've had the portal door for years. But I originally just found it in the dirt. Never figured out who made it or where it came from. I just kept it to myself.

'''Luz:''' Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

'''Eda:''' [''raises eyebrow''] Why? Suddenly curious about my past?

'''Luz:''' [''serious expression''] Always. Always curious.

'''Eda:''' Well, I may have been using it to hide from someone.

'''Luz:''' Hide from who?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''from a distance''] Probably me!

[''A sudden strong gust of wind starts blowing, forcing Eda and Luz to shut their eyes and shield their faces. Scene cuts to a bird flying and a tornado coming towards them.'']

'''Luz:''' [''surprised''] Magic bird tornado?

[''The tornado stops, and Gwendolyn lands in front of them. The bird lands back on her [[Witch's Staff|staff]], turning into a [[Palisman|palisman]].'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Hello, little witchlet. [''vanishes her staff, then runs forward with open arms''] Come here.

'''Eda:''' Gwendolyn. [''stops Gwendolyn from coming closer by pressing her hand on her head'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Oof. Are we still on that? I'm your mother. Call me "Mom."

'''Luz and Lilith:''' [''shocked''] Mom?!

'''Gwendolyn:''' It is so good to see you again. [''squeezes Edas face with both hands''] How are you feeling? Are you eating well? I heard all about the Petrification Ceremony. Trust me, I have a lot of strong words for that [[Emperor Belos|Belos]].

'''Lilith:''' [''jumps up to Gwendolyn''] Mother! Mother, you know, I was there too.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Oh, hello to you too, sweet flea. [''touches Liliths hair''] Still dyeing your hair, I see. Well, it's very sleek. Now give me a moment with Edalyn, dear. It's important.

[''Lilith looks surprised, then becomes sad and backs off.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' That's right! Today, I am about to complete a 30-year mission.

'''Eda:''' [''annoyed expression''] Oh, no.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Your mother has finally succeeded.

'''Eda:''' [''pinches her eyebrows''] Here it comes.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Today, I shall be curing [''spins her staff and jabs it on the ground''] your curse!

'''Eda:''' [''digs ear''] No, thanks.

'''Luz and Lilith:''' What?!

'''Eda:''' I said, "No, thanks." I got my elixir system. I'm good.

'''Gwendolyn:''' But... But who knows what they put in those nasty concoctions?

'''Eda:''' Actually, I do. And... [''grabs Gwendolyns staff''] would you look at the time? [''makes Gwendolyn sit on her staff''] I got a lot to do today. So sad to see you go. Okay, bye!

[''Eda slaps on Gwendolyns staff and sends her flying away. She then dusts off her hands.'']

'''Eda:''' Moms. Am I right?

[''Luz and Lilith look at Eda with a completely shocked expression on their faces.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''frustrated''] I haven't seen Mother in forever! And she was handing you a cure on a silver platter!

'''Luz:''' I'd kill to see my mom right now, and you just launch yours into the sky?!

'''Eda:''' Oh, listen, she comes around every year, toting a new cure for my curse. [''starts walking into the house''] But they never work, so I am done getting my hopes up.

'''Lilith:''' [''disbelief''] Mother visits Edalyn regularly? [''follows Eda into the house'']

[''Luz looks to her left. Gwendolyn lands, then walks away with sad expression. Luz makes a pitiful sound.'']

'''Luz:''' [''from a distance''] Mrs. Clawthorne?

[''Gwendolyn turns around.'']

'''Luz:''' Wait! [''runs up to Gwendolyn''] I'm Luz. Eda's apprentice. I think what you're doing is so sweet. Eda can just be so... Eda sometimes.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Call me Gwen, dear. But please don't blame Edalyn. It was the curse that created the rift between us.

'''Luz:''' I understand. Right now, there's an actual rift between me and my mom in the [[Human Realm]].

'''Gwendolyn:''' Human Realm? Hmm. [''gasps''] My dear, I may know how to fix both our rifts.

'''Luz:''' [''excited''] Really?

'''Gwendolyn:''' I've heard some information that may assist you on your quest. Help me cure Eda's curse and that information is yours.

'''Luz:''' [''exhilarated''] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Where do we start?

'''Gwendolyn:''' We'll be consulting someone [''grabs her necklace, the rune on it starts flashing''] very special.

[''Scene cuts to Luz and Gwendolyn walking someplace.'']

'''Luz:''' So we're gonna meet a curse expert? This is so rad.

'''Gwendolyn:''' Yes, after years of dealing with the Healing Coven, I finally found someone who promised me a cure. [''stops''] Ah! Here we are.

[''Gwendolyn and Luz are standing in front of a stone door. Gwendolyn walks up to it and displays her necklace. The door flashes, then opens up, revealing a cave. Gwendolyn and Luz walks into the cave. Inside, an old witch with 4 hands is sitting on an altar. A gremlin with boils on his eyelids kneels in front of him.'']

'''Gremlin:''' Please, they're so itchy.

[''The old witch waves his hand, casting a spell circle. A circle of purple light surrounds the gremlin and lifts him up. The light then flashes, and after that, the gremlin is healed. Gwendolyn and Luz gasps at the sight of that, with Gwendolyn looking happy and Luz looking shocked. The gremlin is then put down on the ground.'']

'''Gremlin:''' Boils, they're... they're gone! Thank you, Wortlop. Thank you. [''runs away crying happily'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' That's [[Master Wortlop]]. He's a traveling curse expert who's perfected next-level healing magic.

[''Master Wortlop gestures for Gwendolyn to come over.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Ooh.

[''Gwendolyn pushes Luz aside and passes her staff to her. She walks up to Wortlop and kneels in front of him.'']

'''Master Wortlop:''' Gwendolyn, my pupil. Your aura is shining bright.

'''Gwendolyn:''' It took many months, but I was able to gather the sacred items you requested. [''takes out an egg''] The copper egg from the Snowy Rib Cage, [''takes out a dagger''] the silver dagger from the Swampy Toes, and [''takes out a chalice''] the golden chalice from the desert of Palm Stings.

'''Master Wortlop:''' You're a dedicated mother, aren't you?

[''Master Wortlop summons a tome out of thin air.'']

'''Master Wortlop:''' Inside this tome is the healing ability you seek. [''passes it over to Gwendolyn''] But keep it away from the eyes of non-believers, for many will be blinded by the power it holds.

[''Gwendolyn looks at the tome in awe.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' I understand. [''stands up and bows to Master Wortlop''] I am in your debt, Master Wortlop.

[''Gwendolyn turns around and walks away with Luz. Luz stops, looks at Master Wortlop admiringly, then runs off to catch up with Gwendolyn. Scene changes to outside the Owl House. Gwendolyn drives a sign into the ground while Luz writes APPLE BLOOD and draws an arrow pointing away from the house. [[King]] looks at them from inside the house through a window.'']

'''King:''' Isn't it amazing, [[Francois]]? If Eda's mom can just pop up, who says my dad can't?

[''Luz follows Gwendolyn deeper into the forest. King stretches his arms.'']

'''King:''' NYEH! Better get my hugging arms ready.

'''Lilith:''' Ha!

[''King opens his eyes and stares at Lilith. She is lying on the couch eating ice-cream.'']

'''Lilith:''' Yeah, good luck with all that dad stuff. [''munches''] Sometimes it doesn't matter how dutiful you are or successful you are, parents just won't give you the time of day.

'''King:''' Don't listen to her, Francois. My dad won't be like that.

'''Lilith:''' [''sneers''] Right. Your mysterious father, who didn't even stick around to watch you hatch.

[''King stares at Lilith with a devastated expression.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''dejected''] Looks like you and I are in the same boat, King.

[''King whimpers and clutches Francois closer to himself.'']

[''Scene cuts to the forest. Luz ties up a rope and wipes off sweat from her forehead.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Nice work, Luz. [''her palisman drops her on a stone''] With Wortlop's tome and your ability to lure Eda out of the house, we'll be curing that curse in no time.

'''Luz:''' Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's always down for more apple blood. So, [''stands up''] that Wortlop guy was really something. You're his pupil?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''looks up from her tome''] Oh, yes. But first, I had to prove that I was worthy of his secrets. So I spent the last year on a bunch of dangerous quests. And [''flashes her bicep muscles''] I didn't even get that many scars.

'''Luz:''' [''amazed''] Cool. Also, dang, girl, [''compares her bicep to Gwendolyns''] your bicep game is ridiculous.

[''Someone steps on a stick and causes leaves to rustle.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''gasps''] Our signs must've worked. [''runs away together with Luz'']

'''Eda:''' [''follows the signs into the woods''] Oh, baby, time to stock up on Mama's night juice.

[''Gwendolyn and Luz overlook Eda from a tree branch high up.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' According to Wortlop's tome, we start by lowering the beast's defenses with special crystals. And they're supposed to be quite calming.

'''Eda:''' Whoa! 

[''Eda narrowly avoids a falling crystal, spins her staff to shatter the rest, then narrowly avoids another falling crystal.'']

'''Eda:''' [''stares at the ground oddly''] Knife season came early this year.

[''A large shadow looms over Eda. Eda looks up, screams and jumps back, narrowly avoid a large crystal. She lies on the ground, looking shocked. A bunch of feathers pops out of her.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] She's stressed.

[''Luz takes out an elixir from her pouch. She is about to throw it to Eda, but Gwendolyn grabs her hand and stops her.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Oh, no, no, no. The texts say those feathers mean we're driving the beast out.

'''Luz:''' Oh. [''stares down at the elixir with a worried expression'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''puts her hand on the elixir''] Don't worry. After today, Eda will never have to drink those nasty little things again.

'''Luz:''' [''smiles''] All right. What do we do next?

'''Gwendolyn:''' Next, we're gonna put that beast [''releases a puff of smoke from her bag, which forms a cloud with a face''] on ice.

[''The cloud spouts out ice from its mouth.'']

[''Back at the Owl House, Lilith and King are lying on the couch. They both groan from eating too much ice-cream.'']

'''King:''' How do you get a parent's attention?

'''Lilith:''' Heck if I know. Mother wasn't even at my Coven Initiation. [''munches another spoonful of ice-cream'']

'''King:''' At least you know what she looks like. [''sits up''] All I have is an old wall carving. What if that's just graffiti?

'''[[Hooty]]:''' [''opens the door''] Heh, that's, uh, [''stretches into the living room''] that's an awful lot of ice cream you guys are eating. [''stretches towards Lilith with a wary expression''] You know Eda gets that stuff from the [[Night Market]], right?

'''Lilith:''' [''points at Hooty accusingly''] Are you my mother? Because that is an awful lot of judgment.

'''King:''' This stinks. [''throws away the ice cream container on his head''] If my dad doesn't care about me, why should I [''drops Francois''] care about him? Hmm? Well, I'm not going to him. He's gonna have to come to me! [''lies down with his arms crossed'']

'''Lilith:''' [''sits up angrily''] And I am sick of being overlooked. From now on I... [''stands up angrily''] I have no mother! And I... I'd say that to her face!

'''King:''' [''stands up''] Yeah!

'''Hooty:''' [''hesitantly''] Isn't that taking it a bit too far?

'''King:''' It's not taking it far enough. Go tell her. [''gestures towards outside''] Go on. She's right outside.

'''Lilith:''' [''surprised''] She is???

'''King:''' Yeah, I saw her go off with Luz. I think they're gonna heal Eda's curse or whatever.

'''Lilith:''' [''realization''] Uh, oh. Is that so? Mother paying attention to Edalyn... again. I mean, [''waves her hands''] it's not like I care.

[''Lilith sets her arms akimbo and grins. A bunch of feathers pop out of her face. Hooty slowly retreats away from her.'']

'''King:''' [''hesitantly''] You got, uh, uh... [''points to his face''] You got a little, uh, hmm

[''Lilith gasps, then turns around to lift up the couch seat. There's nothing but feathers.'']

'''Lilith:''' WHERE- [''notices the elixirs gone'']

[''Lilith lifts up the flower pot.'']

'''Lilith:''' ARE- [''notices the elixirs gone too'']

[''Lilith opens the cupboard door.'']

'''Lilith:''' THE ELIXIRS?! [''finds it empty'']

[''Lilith starts covering her face and sobs. A while later, she drops to the ground on her knees, still sobbing. King pops out from behind the door.'']

'''King:''' [''hesitantly''] Lilith?

[''King walks into the room. Hooty follows King from behind. Lilith suddenly jolts up and lets out a terrifying scream. Her eyes turn black and her voice becomes deeper. Scene cuts to Hooty and King watching Lilith turn into the Raven beast with a terrified expression. Her shadow looms over the duo.'']

'''King:''' [''tries to offer his ice-cream''] Weh?

[''Scene cuts back to the forest.'']

'''Eda:''' [''climbs up a cliff''] This better be the oldest, strongest, stinkiest apple blood [''looks up''] ever.

[''Eda sees a sign which says IT REALLY IS'' THAT GOOD!'' and screams in frustration. She then begrudgingly keeps on walking, but accidentally slips on some gooey substance.'']

'''Eda:''' Ah! [''balances herself, looks down at her shoes and groans''] I just stole these.

[''Eda keeps on walking, but accidentally steps into a trap covered with leaves, which sends her flying upwards, screaming. Gwendolyn looks at this with a serious expression while Luz is shocked at the sight of this.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' It seems like the curse isn't my daughter's only problem.

[''Eda screams and lands on a bush. Her [[Owl Staff|owl staff]] flies to her.'']

'''Eda:''' [''reaches out to her staff''] Help Mama up.

'''Luz:''' Gwen, [''turns to Gwendolyn''] we tried freezing the curse out, we tried sweating the curse out, we even tried [''shrugs''] flying snakes for some reason.

[''Down below, Eda is running away from 2 flying snakes, screaming as Luz and Gwendolyn watch on.'']

'''Luz:''' I don't think this stuff is working. Did Wortlop ever say where he learned this stuff? [''looks to Gwendolyn'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''to a [[Crow Phone|crow phone]]''] Yes, I'm sending it right away. [''hangs up call, crow caws and flies up'']

'''Luz:''' [''squints''] What did you just do?

'''Gwendolyn:''' It turns out [''slips some gems into a pouch''] the ancient tome is only the first [''hands over the pouch to the crow''[ of a series. So, I'm trading in a few paltry family heirlooms to get the rest. [''flips open the book to read'']

'''Luz:''' [''dubious''] Let me see that book. [''walks towards Gwendolyn'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''stops Luz''] Halt. Only people who have scaled Wortlop's [''displays her necklace''] "Pyramid of Study" can touch the tome.

[''Luz grabs the tome off Gwendolyns hands using vines from [[Plant Glyph|plant glyph]].'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Hey!

'''Luz:''' [''flips open book''] What is this? ''Jar of bees for existential dread? Aromatherapy for broken legs? Bird songs for sufferers of stuffy noses?!'' [''turns towards Gwendolyn''] Gwen, you're being scammed! Wortlop is a fake.

'''Gwendolyn:''' You really think I'd spend my life savings [''takes back the tome''] on a fake?

'''Luz:''' I know you want what's best for Eda, and so do I. [''takes out an elixir from her waist pouch''] But I'm calling this off. [''walks off and kneels down on one leg'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Luz, [''grabs her arm''] I really thought [''takes away the elixir''] we were on the same side. According to Wortlop, poison like this is made by healers and potion makers who simply [''flips open book''] want money.

'''Luz:''' [''angrily''] Are you kidding me?! You just... [''pinches her eyebrows''] Argh, whatever. I'll just get more at the house.

'''Gwendolyn:''' I'm afraid that will be a waste of your time.

[''Her palisman drops a sack filled with elixirs in front of Gwendolyn.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [[Hawksley]] cleared out every bottle hours ago.

'''Luz:''' Whoa. [''stands up angrily''] Why would you do that?

'''Gwendolyn:''' Because I am a mother who will do anything for her daughter.

[''Gwendolyn tries to throw a bottle of elixir away, but Luz pounces on her and tries to grab the elixir, causing both of them to fall.'']

'''Eda:''' Ugh. [''throws away a flying snake stuck in her hair''] Woo, this ain't good.

[''Behind Eda, both Gwendolyn and Luz scream as they fall from above. They land behind a bush while the elixers shatters when the bag hits the ground, which grabs Edas attention. They both grimace in pain, with Gwendolyn rubbing her forehead.'']

'''Eda:''' Hey!

[''Both look up.'']

'''Eda:''' What is going on here? [''looks at both of them'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Witchlet, [''pats off leaf on her shoulder''] it's okay. [''puts hand on Luzs shoulder''] Luz and I are working to heal you.

[''Luz stares at Eda with a guilty expression.'']

'''Eda:''' What? This was all you? [''becomes angry''] You weren't healing me. You nearly killed me!

[''As Eda speaks, more feathers start popping out from her body.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda, please try to stay calm.

'''Eda:''' Why? Why should I be calm? I have a right to be UP-SET!

[''While speaking, Eda closes her eyes, when she opens it again before finishing the last word, it turns fully black. She transforms into her Owl Beast form in front of Luz and Gwendolyn. Scene changes to her lying face down in the shadowy void with her eyes closed. The Owl Beast steps in front of her, rumbling the ground. Eda opens her eyes and notices the large Owl Beast standing in front of her.'']

'''Eda:''' Ooh, let's get this over with.

[''Eda turns around and starts running away, panting. Scene cuts back to the forest, Eda in her Owl Beast form is closing in on Gwendolyn and Luz while growling.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Don't worry. According to this, [''casts spell circle to summon tome and look at it''] we just have to... [''hesitates''] Uh...

'''Luz:''' Have to what?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''turns around to show Luz the tome''] Buy the next volume...?

[''Luz takes a deep breath, then makes an exasperated grunt. Eda roars and takes a step closer towards them. Behind them, King screams and runs out from a bush. He notices Owl Beast Eda and cries out in shock.'']

'''Luz:''' King?!

'''King:''' So Lilith was feeling stressed and, uh, the light glyph didn't really work. So, uh... uh... uh...

[''A large shadow flies past them from above. They all look up, some gasp. Lilith in her Raven Beast form turns around and lands in front of them, revealing herself to be much larger than Owl Beast Eda.'']

'''King:''' SHE TURNED INTO THAT THING!

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''shocked''] Sweet flea?

[''Lilith lets out a loud roar. Eda roars and rushes towards her, with her rushing towards Eda as well. Lilith then snatches Eda and flies off with her, while Luz, King and Gwendolyn look on in total disbelief. Luz picks up the Owl staff and rides atop it, ready to take off.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''disbelief''] That was my little sweet flea? That means she's also...

'''King:''' CURSED! YES! Were you not paying any attention to her? [''climbs up the Owl staff and sits behind Luz'']

'''Luz:''' We have to help them. Will you [''reaches out her hand''] come with me?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''hesitates''] This... This must be part of the process, right?

'''Luz:''' [''closes her eyes''] I can see you still need a little time. [''opens eyes''] Alright, [[Owlbert]]. [''Owlbert hoots''] Let's fly!

[''Gwendolyn looks at Luz flying away with a hesitant expression while clutching her necklace. She then turns around and flies towards the other direction on her staff.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''clutches her necklace''] Wortlop... he's not a fake, is he? [''lands in front of the cave door''] After everything I did for him

[''The cave door is not fully closed, leaving a gap for Gwendolyn to peep inside. She sees something and gasps. Inside, someone has hung up Master Wortlops clothing accessories. The camera zooms out, revealing 4 gremlins surrounded by piles of [[Snail|snails]]. One of the gremlins is trying on some jewelries. A fire pit with [[Fire Bee|fire bees]] in it can be seen in the middle of the cave.'' ]

'''Gremlin #1:''' Hey, what do you wanna call this one? [''dugs up a pile of dirt with his hands and put them in a jar'']

'''Gremlin #2:''' [''staring at his jewelries''] Eh, I don't know. Cleansing mud?

'''Gremlin #3:''' Yeah, from the Healing Bogs of the Hips or whatever. What do you think? [''looks to Gremlin #4'']

'''Gremlin #4:''' I think [''turns around covering his eyes''] we're gonna be rich! [''puts down his hands, revealing some fake boils on his eyelids'']

[''All 4 gremlins laugh. The fire suddenly becomes bigger, causing them to scream and scamper away. The fire is then separated by Gwendolyn using a spell circle. She gazes ahead with a furious expression. 3 of the gremlins rush to the altar and put on the clothing accessories, pretending to be Master Wortlop.'']

'''Master Wartlop:''' Mrs. Clawthorne? [''clears throat, changes to a deeper voice''] What a fortuitous surprise.

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''sternly''] You know, right after Eda was cursed I joined the Beast Keeper Coven. [''A fire bee lands on her finger, then flies away''] I thought they surely would know what to do. [''walks towards Master Wortlop''] But the beast keepers told me the curse couldn't be tamed. And the Healers told me it couldn't be [''changes to sad expression''] healed. Eda told me she found something that made it manageable at least. But I didn't listen.

'''Master Wortlop:''' I could give you the next volume. 5% off? 10% off?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''sternly''] Leave.

[''The fire behind her becomes larger, startling Master Wortlop. Gwendolyn gives him a death stare with the fire burning behind her.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''sternly''] And if I ever see you in [[Bonesborough]] again, every beast in the forest will be after your HEAD!

[''The 3 gremlins jump out from under the robe, scream and immediately dig their way underground. The fire immediately dies down back to the original fire pit size.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''chuckles''] Still got it.

[''Scene cuts to a shot of Bonesborough. Owl Beast Eda and Raven Beast Lilith both fly past the camera. Eda tries to escape Lilith, but she keeps on pursuing her. Lilith manages to catch Eda and pins her to the ground, damaging some buildings among the process and causing people to flee in terror. Eda kicks Lilith off her and flies away. Lilith growls and pursues Eda again. They continue fighting each other in air and eventually, both crash to the ground. Luz and King fly past on the Owl staff just in time to see this.'' ]

'''Luz:''' [''anxiously''] Gotta think fast. [''notices something ahead''] Whoo!

'''[[Morton]]:''' [''dejectedly''] No one's bought anything in a while. [''reaches to the wooden panel handle''] I should close up shop.

'''Luz:''' [''from a distance''] Morton!

'''Morton:''' [''looks up''] Hmm?

[''Luz lands in front of [[Mr. Elixir]], almost crashing into Morton, causing him to cry out in surprise.'']

'''Luz:''' I need every last elixir you have.

[''Morton gasps happily.'']

'''Luz:''' Also, do you accept [''takes out a drawing of Morton from her pocket''] payment in hyper-realistic pencil portraits? [''grins at Morton'']

[''Morton becomes unhappy and closes the panel door in front of Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Shoot! I thought I was improving. [''looks down at the drawing sadly'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''from a distance''] Don't worry!

[''Luz and King turn around in surprise. Gwendolyn lands in front of them and spins her staff. She is carrying a large bag of snails.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Mama's here. [''shows the bag of snails'']

[''Scene cuts back to Eda and Lilith. Eda roars at Lilith. Lilith attempts to bite Eda, but she manages to dodge her and fly away. Eda then lands atop a roof, while Lilith catches up with her and pins her down. Luz, King and Gwendolyn watch them from another roof across the duo.'']

'''Luz:''' You sure this is gonna work? [''glances over at Gwendolyn'']

'''King:''' Yeah, [''squints at Gwendolyn''] are you like, secretly sending us to our deaths?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''sternly''] No, I'm making things right.

[''Gwendolyn pulls off her necklace, throws it down and steps on it, breaking the necklace into pieces. Luz and King ride onto the Owl staff and fly away. Eda appears on screen and screeches. Gwendolyn casts a spell circle, summoning some flying boards to her. She approaches Eda and Lilith by stepping onto the boards.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''regretfully''] My beautiful daughters, I failed you.

[''Eda turns towards Gwendolyn. She snarls and walks towards her.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Edalyn? You're in there, aren't you?

[''Eda growls at Gwendolyn, but she puts her hand on Edas hair anyway. The camera zooms into Edas eye. The scene then changes to the shadowy void, where Eda is still running away from the Owl Beast. While shes doing so, Gwendolyns voice can be heard coming from outside.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' I should've listened to you. I know now why you pushed me away.

'''Eda:''' [''stops running''] Uh, Mom?

'''Gwendolyn:''' I made you think your curse was something to be ashamed of.

[''The Owl Beast rushes towards Eda and screeches at her, while Eda stares down at it.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Whether we want it or not, it's a part of you. And I love EVERY part of you.

[''Eda stops the Owl Beast with her hand. Light flashes in between her hand and the beast. The Owl Beast screeches, gradually shrinking. It eventually becomes small, and runs away tweeting.'']

'''Eda:''' [''calls out''] Mom, I can hear you. And you...

[''Eda pounces on the Owl Beast and pins it down, putting it in a chokehold.'']

'''Eda:''' My turn to drive.

[''Scene cuts back to Gwendolyn. She shuts her eyes and puts her forehead into Edas forehead.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''regretfully''] I'm so sorry.

'''Eda:''' Mom?

[''Gwendolyn opens her eyes to find Eda staring back at her, her eyes already revert back to normal.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Witchlet! [''hugs Eda'']

[''Lilith roars and attempts to pounce at Eda, but Eda grabs her wrist and pins her down.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' And Lilith... [''kneels down in front of her''] you were always so self-sufficient.

[''Gwendolyn caresses Liliths cheek, calming her down.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''regretfully''] But I didn't give you the attention you deserved.

[''Upon hearing that, Raven Beast Lilith starts sobbing. Gwendolyn shushes her and embraces her, caressing her head.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''looks up and shouts''] NOW!

[''Luz and King flies towards them from above. King jumps down from the staff, pinning Eda and Lilith down by stepping on their ears. Luz pulls out the bottle corks with her teeth, and dumps the elixirs into Edas and Liliths mouth. A cloud of air appears and surrounds the duo. The strong airflow forces Gwendolyn to shield her face and blows King backwards. King almost rolls off the roof, but Luz lands just in time to catch him. The cloud expands and flashes brightly, then forms then shape of a bird. Eda and Lilith is pulled upwards. The cloud eventually bursts and gives off a bright flash.'']

'''Luz:''' [''impressed''] Dang, that is good elixir.

[''Gwendolyn walks forward. Eda and Lilith descend from above, right into Gwendolyns arms. She sits down with them in her arms and stares at Eda lovingly.'']

'''Eda:''' [''opens her eyes and smiles at Gwendolyn''] About time, Mom.

'''Lilith:''' [''sobs''] Mom, I heard you but I couldn't stop myself. I... I couldn't do anything. [''continues sobbing'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''hugs Lilith''] It's okay. Everything is okay now. [''hugs Eda together''] I'm here for you both.

[''Luz smiles gladly at the sight of this, while King comes to a realization.'']

'''King:''' She was trying to do her best, huh?

[''Gwendolyn hugs her daughters tight and smiles lovingly as Luz and King look at them from aside.'']

[''Scene changes. It's now nighttime and Luz, King, Eda and Gwendolyn are standing outside the Owl House.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused, but I- I just wanted to help. I should've trusted you more.

'''Eda:''' Yeah, you [''jokingly punches Gwendolyn''] should've. But, hey, don't be a stranger. Okay, Mom?

[''Gwendolyn smiles at Eda.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''kicks open the door''] Mom! I'm ready! [''carries a bindle on her shoulder'']

'''Eda:''' [''squints at Lilith''] Huh?

'''Lilith:''' [''walks towards Gwendolyn''] Well, we were talking and I've decided to go home with Mother and make up for lost time. [''smiles at Gwendolyn'']

[''Luz, Eda, King and Hooty are surprised at this announcement.'']

'''Luz:''' What?

'''Eda:''' Lily?

'''King:''' You lived here?

'''Hooty:''' WHAT?

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''sad expression''] Edalyn, Lilith told me how she gave you the curse. I am [''grabs Liliths hand''] so, so sorry to [''grabs Edas hand''] you both, to have this secret weighing you down. [''regretfully''] I wish I knew sooner.

'''Lilith:''' [''to Eda''] There's still a lot to be learned about this curse, but it'll be nice to spend some time home and reconnect with Dad. [''Eda looks away hearing the last part.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' We'll be away for a while, but we have plenty of [''takes out a few elixirs from her hair''] elixirs stocked up!

'''Luz:''' Someday my hair is gonna be big enough to do that too. [''looks at Gwendolyn admiringly'']

'''King:''' [''incredulously''] You actually want that?

'''Hooty:''' [''cries, stretches towards Lilith''] No!!! Lulu, you can't!!!

'''Lilith:''' [''touches Hootys cheek''] Hootsifer, I have to. But don't worry, we can be pen pals. [''turns around and leaves'']

'''Hooty:''' [''cries''] BUT I CANT HOLD A PEEEEEN!!!

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''gratefully''] Luz, if it weren't for you I might still be wrapped up in Wortlop's lies. So here's what I should've told you from the start. [''bends over towards Luz''] You're not the only human to have lived in Bonesborough.

[''Luz gasps.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' There's a rare substance called [[Titan's Blood|Titan's blood]]. It is extremely powerful and sometimes causes leaks between our realms. Plants, animals... And you guys have a lot of garbage, by the way. But humans are rare. My great grandmother told me about a human who once lived here. But one day he just vanished. Rumor has it he left something in the [[Bonesborough Library|library]], and if you can find out more about him...

'''Luz:''' [''hopefully''] Maybe I could find out how he got here!

'''Gwendolyn:''' Exactly. [''winks at Luz'']

[''Lilith and Gwendolyn look back and smile, then fly away together on their staffs.'']

[''Hooty is still crying.'']

'''Eda:''' Well, I'll be on the couch for the next 24 hours. [''yawns and starts walking into the house''] Good night.

'''King:''' No, wait! I call couch.

'''Luz:''' [''puts her hand over her heart and looks up to the sky''] I'll be home soon, Mom.

[''A gust of wind blows past Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' [''looks down sadly''] [[Reality Check Summer Camp|Camp's]] probably ended [''looks back up to sky''] by now.

[''Scene changes to another shot further away from the Owl House. Luz looks up to the sky with a sad expression while Hooty is still crying in the background.'']

'''Luz:''' She must be so worried.

[''Scene transitions to the human realm with an exterior shot of the [[Noceda residence]]. Its night and lights can be seen coming out through the windows on the right side of the house. Scene then changes, showing Camila sitting on a couch inside the living room, covering her face with her hands while crying.'']

'''Camila:''' [''straightens up, wipes off tears with her finger''] I'm sorry. These animal documentaries [''turns off TV with remote control''] make me such a mess.

'''Luz:''' Here, Mama.

[''A hand offers Camila a tissue box. Scene changes to show another Luz sitting on the couch, but her face is covered in darkness, concealing her facial features.'']

'''Camila:''' Thank you, Luz. You always know what to do.

[''Suspenseful background music plays.'']

[''Open on the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] as [[Hooty]] uses the typewriter.'']

'''Hooty:''' Dearest [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lulu]], I hope this letter finds you well, and that youre enjoying [[Keeping Up A-fear-ances|your time with your parents]]. Im writing to let you know, that I am a genius! Whenst I wrote you last, I was in the throes of a malaise. Thats when I got your letter!

[''Flashback to Hooty reading Lilith's letter at night.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''narrating''] Hello, Hootsifer. Your letter concerned me. You write of feeling unimportant while [[Luz Noceda|Luz]], [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[King]] are off on adventures.  

[''Hooty looks up to see his friends' silhouettes in Eda's room, Luz leaving with King in her arms before Eda turns off the light.''] 

'''Lilith:''' But Hooty, you are the Owl House. You take care of everyone inside you. If that isnt a worthy purpose, then what is?

[''Hooty coos softly and enters the living room, where everyone is situated on the couches.'']

'''Hooty:''' How we doin, Hoot House?

'''King:''' Can you keep it [''his voice cracks''] down? [''adjusts his voice''] Down! [''does it again''] Down! Why does this keep happening?

'''Hooty:''' [''approaches King''] Sounds like our little demon is becoming a deMAN!

'''King:''' [''pushes Hooty away''] Ugh! Why does that sound so wrong coming from [''voice cracks again''] you? YOU! [''unintelligible angry noise''] I am done with this!  

[''King runs off.'']

'''Hooty:''' Ha ha ha! [''to Eda''] Those teens, eh? Their moods change like the wind.

[''Eda lowers the paper she's holding up, revealing the shadows under her eyes, which are being kept open with clothespins.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''taken aback''] WHOA!

'''Eda:''' I'm freaking out, Hooty. [[Emperor Belos|Belos]] is planning something big, and I'm weaker than a newborn witchling. If I wanna protect you guys, I have to train as hard as I can to get strong! No rest!

'''Hooty:''' But every time you overwork yourself, you turn into the Owl Beast!

'''Eda:''' I SAID NO REST!

[''Eda blows an air horn and leaves, irritating Luz who's lying on the other couch with the echo mouse's terrarium in front of her.'']

'''Luz:''' Can you please be quiet?! Youre scaring the echo mouse. And if hes not happy, Ill never make my way into [[Amity Blight|Amity]]'s heart. [''realizes what she just said, a flush spreads across her face''] I mean make a portal back home. Uh! We have to go!  

[''Luz picks up the terrarium and runs out of the room.'']

'''Hooty:''' You were right, Lulu. These three needed my help. So I devised the plan of plans.

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-'''

[''Open back up to Hooty moving through the halls to the kitchen.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating''] Your words inspired me to help everyone, Lulu. So Ill start with King!

[''King is shown on the table surrounded by several books.'']

'''King:''' Maybe if I figure out what kind of demon I am, Ill know whats going on. [''swaps one book for another''] But nothing in here looks like me!

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating''] Our little bundle of joy was growing up, and he had questions. As the only other demon in the house, I had answers! But would he accept help from me?  

[''Hooty shakes his head.'']  

'''Hooty:''' Never! Unless

[''Hooty briefly leaves and is soon on top of King, eyes glowing and mouth open. Just as King sees him, the screen goes dark. A moment later, King emerges from an owl pellet in a dark room.'']

'''King:''' [''mad''] Ugh! Ugh! AAH! DID YOU OWL PELLET ME?!

'''Hooty:''' Are you angry? Sweaty? Is there hair in places? Does your voice crack in a super embarrassing way? I have the answers you seek!

[''The lights turn on: Hooty has brought King to the tower, where he's set up diagrams, charts and boards for "Demon Puberty 101.5".'']

'''Hooty:''' Youre going through demon puberty!

'''King:''' [''facepalms''] UGH! The last thing I want from you is a health class!

'''Hooty:''' This isnt a health class!  

[''Hooty pulls down a chart of demon traits titled "Who Am I?"''] 

'''Hooty:''' Its an unholy test, to determine what kind of demon you are!

'''King:''' [''hopeful''] Really?!

'''Hooty:''' Yup! Besides, Im pretty sure Im the only other demon here, so ha ha, what other choice do you have? 

'''King:''' Eh all right. What the heck.

'''Hooty:''' YAAAAY!  

[''He dons a beret/mortarboard and begins the lesson.''] 

'''Hooty:''' Our ancestors arose from the muck of a decomposing titan. And there are so many of us! But all demons can be placed in three categories; bug, biped, and beast!

'''King:''' Yeah okay, everyone knows about the three Bs [makes a casual hand gesture.]

'''Hooty:''' [''gets in King's face''] DO NOT INTERRUPT! [''slinks back to the board''] Now Im pretty sure youre not a bug, but we cant rule anything out. As a type of worm myself-

[''Hooty wiggles, causing King to give off a disgusted shudder.'']

'''Hooty:''' Im an expert on this subject! LETS BEGIN!

[''Hooty picks King up and has him don dancing clothes. King lets off an annoyed "WEH!"'' In the background, Hooty's demonology board titled "Bug" shows some demons from that category, including a picture of Adegast. Hooty looks at the board, then turns to King.]

'''Hooty:''' Bug types naturally communicate through dance, like so!

[''A fairy and a two-faced butterfly give them a brief demo.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''sniffling while crying''] Poetic!

[''King makes various grunting noises while freestyle dancing. When he stops, Hooty is shown mouth agape and the fairy and the butterfly also look shocked. Then Hooty starts hissing in rage.'']

'''Hooty:''' DONT YOU TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER!

[''King screams as Hooty chases him. After a moment, Hooty has calmed down and King is panting, with a ruffled fur and a dent in his right horn. In the background, Hooty's demonology board titled "Biped", features some demons from that category, such as Eileen, Selene, Tibbles and Warden Wrath.'']

'''Hooty:''' Well, your dance was offensive, and your attempt to spin a cocoon was just Sad. Honestly.

'''King:''' [''ashamed, hugs his tail''] Can we-just not talk about the cocoon?

'''Hooty:''' Okay! Lets see if youre a biped demon! They walk on two legs and even have bile sacs, just like witches! So for this test, youre gonna have a duel with a little friend of mine.

[''Hooty taps the top of a box, and out comes [[Tiny Nose]] playing on a game console.'']

'''King:''' A scuffle, eh? All right, all right, lets do it. Just uh dont get mad if you cant-

[''Hooty rings a bell.'']

'''Tiny Nose:''' Hmph!  

[''Tiny Nose lets out a battle cry, followed by grunting noises as she uses magic to trounce King all while he screams again as a blast of smoke is shown erupting from a window. Once again, cut to King coughing and groaning.'']

'''Hooty:''' Wow! Heh, not a single spell! Even bug demons have some magic.

'''King:''' It-its fine! Its fine. Lets just keep going.

'''Hooty:''' Okay, okay. Theres only one way to test for beast types.  

[''Tiny Nose pops out of a box wearing a mask and holding a comically large needle.''] 

'''Hooty:''' Im gonna need a blood sample.

'''Tiny Nose:''' I gwaduated fwom medical school!

[''Cut to outside the Owl House as a "poink" is heard, followed by King screaming in pain again. Back inside, King is waiting.'']

'''Hooty:''' After reviewing the results, weve come to a conclusion.

'''King:''' Lay it on me. Beast, bug, biped, I dont care. I just want to know what I am!

'''Hooty:''' You

'''King:''' [''gasps'']

'''Hooty:''' Are you!

'''Tiny Nose:''' [''holds a tray with a crumble''] Hooway!

'''King:''' [''confused''] Wheh?

'''Hooty:''' The blood tests were inconclusive; We dont really know what you are! But thats okay! Cause we dont need to know that to be your friends!

'''King:''' [''frustrated laugh''] I-I thought you had real answers

'''Hooty:''' The only real answer is inside your heart!  

[''Hooty nuzzles King only for the demon to push him off with a "NYEH!"'']

'''King:''' I dont need you to tell me to love myself, Hooty. I want to know where I came from. What my Dad looked like. What Ill look like when I grow up.  

[''Hooty takes a look of sadness.''] 

'''King:''' I dont have any responses to my video, yet, or my wanted posters. Maybe my Dad is gone, maybe theres no one else like me, and Ill live my whole life without any answers!

'''Hooty:''' NO! I didnt want to make you mad.

'''King:''' [''angry, on the verge of crying''] Well I am mad, at him, for not being here! [''sniffles as a few tears fall''] ''He left me''... '''''ALONE!'''''

[''Upon saying that, he emits a soundwave that blows up all the balloons and the crumble as it disperses. Back in the tower, King is panting hard before he notices the damaged decorations.'']

'''King:''' Huh?

'''Hooty:''' [''downhearted''] Oh no. Now Im sad, too.

'''Tiny Nose:''' At least the cake is good.

'''Hooty:''' IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CRUMBLE!  

[''Hooty backs out of the window.'']

'''King:''' Hooty? Hooty!

[''Break.'' ''Scene cut to Hooty sadly returning to the front door.''] 

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating''] Things got a little, uh, messy with King. But I wasnt about to give up! [''regains his confidence''] What Eda said confused me; how could she get stronger, if shes bone-tired? And maybe I was being a Nervous Nellie, but I couldnt shake my fear of the Owl Beast coming out.

'''Eda:''' [''pacing''] Me? Sleep? HA! Not until I can call myself the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles once again!  

[''Eda comes across a plate of cookies.''] 

'''Eda:''' Hmm. [reads ''the accompanying note''] A reward for all your hard work. Love, Hooty Hmm. Not a bad idea. I could use the fuel.  

[''She takes a bite of one.''] 

'''Eda:''' Dang, owl boy can bake.  

[''She takes another bite only to detect something: she rubs some crumbs between her fingers and see "Zzz"s making snoring sounds.''] 

'''Eda:''' [[Sleeping Nettle|Sleeping nettles]]?

'''Hooty:''' YUP! One bite will put you to sleep for hours! 

'''Eda:''' Sleeping nettles dont just put you to sleep, they heighten your dreams! Do you realize [[Owl Beast|who]] you just stuck me with?

[''She starts to hear growling.'']

'''Eda:''' Hooty, dont let me fall asleep!  

[''She shakes him, only for him to fall over with only a portion of his body shown.'']

'''Dream Hooty:''' YUP! One bite will put you to sleep for hours! [''echoing''] For hours! For hours!

'''Eda:''' You know, maybe this is an opportunity. The Owl Beast is why I ran away from home. The Owl Beast is why I never got close to anyone. And the Owl Beast-

[''The beast appears.'']

'''Eda:''' Is why I dont have magic.

'''Owl Beast:''' [''growling'']

'''Eda:''' Ha, youve haunted me long enough, bird brain. I think its time for me to haunt you. Huh?

[''Eda's a teenager again, and she's in her old room. She looks in the mirror.'']

'''Teenage Eda:''' Huh. Well, this is a development.

'''[[Gwendolyn Clawthorne|Gwendolyn]]:''' [''offscreen''] Edalyn, come downstairs please!

[''Teenage Eda comes down, seeing her mother materialize setting up the table. Lilith (also a teenager) appears soon after.'']

'''Teenage Lilith:''' [''holds up a swan-shaped napkin''] Mother, do you like my napkin folding?

'''Teenage Eda:''' [''groans'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''not looking''] Thats nice, sweet flea. Edalyn, help us set up, wont you?

'''Teenage Eda:''' Sorry, dream Mom, I dont have time for... whatever this is. Im on a mission.

'''Gwendolyn:''' [''laughs''] Youre going to say that, the night your [[Dell Clawthorne|dad]] leaves for the mandible?

'''Teenage Eda:''' Dad?

[''As if on cue, her father comes in the front door.'']

'''Dell:''' Hey Pumpkin! Here to see me off?

'''Teenage Eda:''' Dad! [''hugs him, choking up''] Its so good to see you again.

'''Dell:''' I was only gone for an hour. Hey! I know I wont be home for a while, so thats why tonight...

'''Teenage Eda:''' Wait I remember this, now.

'''Dell:''' ... Ill be leavin in style!

[''Dell sets off a party popper with purple lights. Teenage Eda gasps as she starts to transform. Teenage Eda watches as her father holds the beast back.'']

'''Teenage Eda:''' No! I wont let you ruin this again!

[''She grabs the owl beast and throws it out the door. When she shuts it, she's back to her present day appearance. Eda turns around and sees her teenage self on her knees sporting feathers. They look at Dell groaning in pain and he holds hid bleeding left eye.'']

'''Gwendolyn:''' Dell! Lillith, call the Healing Coven. Now!

'''Eda:''' It wasnt your fault. IT WAS YOURS!  

[''Eda raises her fist, unaware she's a young adult now and was dating [[Raine Whispers|Raine]].'']

'''Raine:''' Eda, I- [''sees Eda''] WHOA! What are you doing?!

'''Young adult Eda:''' UH! [''gasping for breath''] Raine! HAHA! Uh, nothing! I'm fine! [''nervous laugh'']

'''Raine:''' [''saddened''] Youre lying again. Its like I dont even know you. So, Ive made a decision.

'''Young adult Eda:''' Okay okay, I know how this plays out. I hope that Ill be ready this time. You hear me, bird brain?!

'''Raine:''' Im joining the Bard Coven, and...

'''Young adult Eda:''' No no no, I hate this part.

'''Raine:''' I think we should see other people. Im sorry, Eda. Its over.

[''Eda starts gasping and groaning. Her hands are growing claws and feathers. The Owl Beast is heard growling.'']

'''Raine:''' [''concerned''] Are you okay? Is this the curse?

[''As Eda is panting, her present self grabs her shoulders.'']

'''Eda:''' Just tell them! Let them help!

'''Young adult Eda:''' Ha ha! Its fine! Everythings normal! You can leave now!

'''Raine:''' I cant do this anymore.  

[''Raine turns their back and fade away.'']

'''Eda:''' Stop pushing them away!

[However, when the young adult Eda puts her hands down, the Owl Beast can be seen instead]

'''Owl Beast:''' [jumps away from Eda and ''screams.'']

'''Eda:''' [''gets angry''] You!

[Eda jumps onto the Owl Beast's back and angrily grabs him.]

'''Owl Beast:''' [''screeching'']

'''Eda:''' It was always you!

'''Owl Beast:''' [''howling'']

'''Eda:''' [''grunting and struggling'']

'''Eda:''' It was all your fault! STOP. RUINING. MY. LIFE!

[''Eda tries to headbutt the owl beast, only for it to disappear and her surroundings to turn black as she becomes the beast. The beast is standing over a cliff, purple light flares hit the ground in front of it. When it retreats, it's captured within a net. A mysterious figure appears from behind the net, with a cloak that is gray with black suns on one side and black with gray moons and white stars on the other side.'']

'''The [[Collector]]:''' [''evil cackling''] Dont bother, beast. You cant run away anymore. Its over.

'''Owl Beast:''' [''frightened screech'']

'''The Collector:''' [''evil cackling'']

[''The Owl Beast falls into the boiling sea, transforming into a scroll. It washes up on the shore near Bonesborough and is picked up by a merchant. The merchant looks at the scroll in confusion at first, then shrugs indifferently and places the scroll in a basket with other flotsam. A ways away, Eda is sitting on the shoreline, seeing the tiny Owl Beast trying to fly away, but it can't since it's tethered to Eda by a red thread. Eda sees an elixer bottle and picks it up. The Owl Beast sees it and starts screeching.'']

'''Eda:''' [''tenderly''] Its okay.

'''Tiny Owl Beast:''' [''upset screeching'']

'''Eda:''' [''looks at the elixer''] Now I thought these were a way to fight you, but... I think theyre the reason we can stand here face to face. Listen, neither of us want to be here, but... we are, and theres no changing that. If we cant accept each other, this nightmare will never end. So what do you say? Truce? For now?

[''Eda pours some elixer into her hand, and the tiny Owl Beast starts drinking it.'']

'''Eda:''' [''laughs and snorts''] Its like sandpaper.

[''The beast curls up in Eda's lap. Suddenly, color starts stretching across the sky.'']

'''Eda:''' Wow. Ive never had a dream this pretty.

[''A white light envelops them. Back to the real world, Eda has woken up, but only her shadow is seen. It seems to be bigger and has wings.'']

'''Eda:''' [''gasping for breath, voice is deeper''] Ugh, my head! Huh? Oh jeez, did I turn again?!

[''Eda looks in a mirror and lets out a startled gasp: she's taken the form of a harpy.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''stunned'']  whoa.

'''Hooty:''' [''upset''] I made it worse. I MADE IT WORSE!  

[''Hooty starts to leave.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Hooty wait, its okay!

[''Hooty started sobbing hysterically and left.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Hooty!  

[''Eda looks in the mirror again and lets out a wolf whistle.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Oh girl, this is a hot look.

[''Break. When we return, we've been taken to the inside of Luz's room.'']

'''Luz:''' [''offscreen''] Youre scaring the echo mouse. And if hes not happy, Ill never make my way into Amitys heart. [''embarrassed''] I mean make a portal back home. Uh! We have to go!

[''Luz runs into the room with the terrarium, still blushing, and closes the door with her foot before slumping against it and letting out a sigh.'']

'''Luz:''' [''looks in the terrarium''] Okay, little mouse. If you dont want to tell me about Philip or how he made his portal, maybe you can tell me how to ask out a cotton-candy haired goddess?

[''The Echo Mouse gives her an uninterested squeak and turns around.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating''] Luzs heart was torn between finding a way home, and the pursuit of love. How do I know all that? I suppose Im just attuned to other peoples emotions.  

[''Actually, he was in the room when she wasn't paying attention.''] 

'''Hooty:''' She wasnt going to make any progress if her attention was split.  

[''Hooty puts on a determined face and backs out of the room.'']

'''Luz:''' Amitys smart, cool, and classy. Asking her out should be breathtaking! Emotional! And real! Everyone back home said I was cheesy. Cant let Amity think the same!

[''Someone knocks on her door. When she answers, she finds nothing but a card on the floor. She picks it up.'']

'''Luz:''' [''reading''] As we stumble through life, gloom knows no bounds. Youll only find love when youre in the ground?! Ugh.  

[''She turns the card around.''] 

'''Luz:''' P.S. I mean the basement. [''shouts''] Hooty, I dont have time for this! [''confused''] Also, we have a basement?

[''Luz enters the basement holding a ball of light. When she's reached the bottom of the the stairs, she sees a shadow resembling Amity.'']

'''Luz:''' [''shocked''] Amity?!

[''Upon closer inspection, it's just the shadow of a lampshade. In front of the lamp itself is a large owl pellet.'']

'''Luz:''' [''relieved''] Oh yeah, thats silly, why would Amity be in our-

[''The owl pellet starts moving and muffled noises are heard. It splits open, and gasping for air, out comes Amity.'']

'''Luz:''' [''horrified''] AMITY?!

'''Amity:''' [''surprised''] Luz? Where are we? [''holds her head, trying to remember''] I think Hooty brought me here?

'''Luz:''' [''flustered''] Uh, well, this is our basement. I am so sorry about this. [''helps Amity up''] Hootys been acting weird all day.

'''Amity:''' [''equally flustered''] Yeah heh house demons get like that, after a couple thousand years. [''she puts some distance between them''] Its fine. Listen. [[Through the Looking Glass Ruins|About what happened]], at my place. I kinda if we could just forget about the whole thing? Maybe? I-

'''Luz:''' Hey! Uh! All I care about is getting you out of our dirty weird basement!

[''When she gets closer, she triggers a trapdoor that sends them stumbling into each other. Turning red due to the positions they're holding each other in, they scream as the floor beneath them gives way and sends them down a tunnel; Hooty looks down it with a hoot. The girls reach the bottom and land in a pile of pillows. The second Luz sees where they landed, she lets out a terrified gasp as the cherub embroidered on a pillow winks at her.'']

'''Luz:''' [''quietly''] Oh, no.

[''Luz incinerates the pillow with a fire glyph, causing Amity to scream barely avoiding it. Luz scrambles out of the pile and catches a falling card.'']

'''Luz:''' [''reading''] To return to the world above, make your way through the tunnel of- [''gasp'']

[''Lights turn on to reveal a tunnel of love, complete with swan boat bearing Hooty's face.'']

'''Luz:''' [''quietly''] If Amity sees this, shell think Im such a loser!

'''Amity:''' [''curious''] What is this?

[''Luz cups her face and lets out horrified groan.'']

'''Hooty Ride:''' Hooooooot! [''It wraps around the girls and drops them in the boat.'']

'''Luz and Amity:''' Whoa! Ugh!

'''Tunnel of Love:''' ?I'll conjure up some flowers?

'''Luz:''' [''takes a deep breath''] HOOTY!

'''Tunnel of Love:''' ? We could hold wholesome hands for hours You'll be my sweetheart My sweetheart My wholesome magic sweetheart ?

[''As they enter, Luz buries her face into her hands mortified. Amity looks to the side and sees a giant heart saying "I think you're smart, cool and classy." Flattered, she gives off a small smile and her whole face glows as she starts playing with her hair.'']

'''Luz:''' [''anxious''] Oh no. Im gonna be made fun of again.

'''Amity:''' Did you- um- did you just say something?

[''Before Luz can answer, she sees another display: two bees surrounding a heart saying "Amity bee mine".'']

'''Luz:''' NO! [''tears down the display, gets up holding an antenna''] That was- uh- an invasive species.

[''Giggling is heard from a cherub prop that fires an arrow into the water. Said arrow has a note that reads "U R A QT". Luz gives a terrified yelp as more arrows are fired at them.'']

'''Luz:''' [''deflects the arrows with the antenna''] Im so sorry, Amity! This is not supposed to happen!

[''Amity's face starts to fall. As more displays sing, Luz, unable to take anymore, blows one of them up and lets out a battlecry as she uses glyphs to destroy everything, completely unaware of the look of despair Amity now has. It isn't long before the ride stops. Luz emerges from the water, gasping for air.'']

'''Luz:''' [''panting''] This was a nightmare.

'''Amity:''' [''morose''] Yeah it kinda was. [''gets out of the boat and starts to leave''] Ill get out of your hair.

'''Luz:''' Amity, wait! This wasnt me, this was all Hootys stupid idea!

'''Amity:''' Yeah, this was stupid. I mean, us? Dating? Heh. Thats stupid, right? 

[''Amity turns around, wiping away a tear. Luz gasps but before she can explain, Hooty, shedding his own waterworks, pops up between them.'']

'''Hooty:''' NOOOO! I DID IT AGAIN!

[''Hooty retreats back to the front door once more.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''hysterical sobbing''] I CANT HELP ANYONE! 

[''He starts trying to free himself from the door again, like he did [[Echoes of the Past|before]].'']

'''Hooty:''' OUT! OUT, VILE OWL! RID THIS HOUSE OF THYSELF! 

[''King, still in the tower, looks out the window.'']

'''King:''' Hooty! Calm down, you ding-dong! 

'''Hooty:''' NEVER SHALL I CURSE THIS HOME WITH MY ODIOUS PRESENCE AGAIN!

'''King:''' [''falls out, hangs from the windowsill''] Aahhh!

'''Hooty:''' [''stops sobbing''] Looks like I have to do this the hard way.

[''King looks away as Hooty successfully escapes the door and starts tearing through the ground. Eda, still in harpy form in the house, spots King right as he falls.'']

'''King:''' AAAAAH!

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''catches King''] Oop!

'''King:''' [''surprised''] Eda?!

'''Harpy Eda:''' Dont worry. I think its a good thing! But wheres Luz?

[''The girls have gotten out of the basement through a cellar door.'']

'''Amity:''' Whats going on?

'''Luz:''' I dont know, but things always get weird when Hootys upset.

[''The ground rumbles.'']

'''Luz and Amity:''' Whoa!

[''The tower starts to break apart.'']

'''King:''' Luz! LUZ! RUN! [''struggles in Eda's grasp'']

[''A piece of the tower falls towards the girls and unable to clear away in time, they crouch down.'']

'''King:''' NOOOO!

[''King sends off a sonic wave that destroys the piece. The girls look up and gasp as they see the atmosphere caused by it, Luz staring at Amity for a moment.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''amazed''] Did you do that?

'''King:''' I I think I did? I think I got a power!

[''Eda takes them down and lands by the girls as they stand.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Are you two okay?

'''Luz:''' Whoa. Not as okay as you! Dang girl! I have a few questions for later.

[''Hooty rushes past them still crying his eyes out.'']

'''Hooty:''' I FAILED YOU ALL! I FAILED YOU ALL!

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''reassuring''] No no no, Hooty! You actually weirdly helped me! Im like a harpy woman now!

'''King:''' [''proudly''] And I can explode things with my voice powers!

'''Hooty:''' BUT I STILL FAILED LUZ!

'''Harpy Eda:''' Luz, what was Hooty trying to do?

'''King:''' Quick! Pretend he helped you, before he destroys everything!

[''With no way to avoid it, Luz takes a deep breath and beckons them to come closer. Eda uses her wing to give them some privacy.'']

'''Luz:''' [''whispering''] He was trying to help me ask Amity out.

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''whispering''] Oh, whoa. Do you wanna?

[''Luz sneaks a glance at Amity, who's focused on Hooty, then turns back blushing and nodding.'']

'''Luz:''' [''shyly''] Mm-hmm.

'''Harpy Eda:''' Then do it!

'''Luz:''' Like this?! [''gestures to Hooty, now rolling on the ground'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Yeah, I hear you. I might be able to help. It wont be perfect, but huh, does it really need to be? Good luck, kid!

[''She takes flight with King still in her arms and grabs Hooty before flying high in the sky. Working up the nerve, Luz turns back around.'']

'''Luz:''' Amity?

[''The ground beneath the girls collapses, leaving them in a crater. Luz regains her senses and checks on Amity.'']

'''Luz:''' Oh my gosh, Amity, are you okay?

'''Amity:''' Im all right.  

[''Luz helps her up.'']

'''Luz:''' I was just Ive been wanting to ask you something for a while. But I wanted to do it in the best way! And in the tunnel of love, I thought: Amitys too cool for this. [''turns red'']

'''Amity:''' [''embarrassed''] Im not as cool as you think.

'''Luz:''' Okay. Everything is so crazy right now, and I have no idea what my future holds, but it would be so cool if you were in it. So uh

[''Luz stares at the ground, then takes several deep breaths but before she can say anything Amity interrupts her.'']

'''Amity:''' [''quickly''] Do you wanna go out with me?!

'''Luz:''' [''exhales''] Nooo I was so ready

'''Amity:''' Im sorry, Im sorry, you can say it.

'''Luz:''' [''sighs''] Okay. Amity Blight, do you wanna go out with me?

'''Amity:''' Yes! [''laughs'']

'''Luz:''' Okay!

[''Unsure of what to do now, Luz timidly holds out her hand and Amity takes it into her own.'']

'''Luz:''' Why is this still so scary?

'''Amity:''' I dont know.

[''Up in the sky, Hooty's still crying but now it's tears of joy he's giving off. King gives him a look while Eda watches the girls.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' Dang, Hooty, you really are something.

[''It turns out the crater is in the shape of a heart. Cut to the next day, where everyone is in the living room.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating''] King may not know where he came from, but hes learning more and more about himself every day!

[''King uses his sonic wave to shatter a glass. He attempts to use it on the crystal ball but is stopped by Eda sporting claws.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating''] Eda can become Harpy Eda now! She still drinks her elixir, but shes accepted the Owl Beast as part of her. ITS PROGRESS!!!  

[''Eda looks at her apprentice with pride.'']

'''Hooty:''' [''narrating as the girls study the echo mouse's notes''] And Luzs new GF showed her tips and tricks to get more information from that old humans diary.  

[''As Luz writes down the info, Amity starts staring at her. When Luz notices, they both look away laughing. Hooty smiles at them.'']

'''Hooty:''' Theyre adorable, and deserve all the happiness!

[''Fade back to the present.'']

'''Hooty:''' I had to promise never to help anyone ever again, but nevertheless, Im a genius!

[''He places his letter in the mailbox.'']

'''Hooty:''' Everything solved! No more mysteries! 

[''A shadow looms over him.'']

'''[[Tarak|Unnamed demon]]:''' I beg your pardon. Would you see this finds its way to King Clawthorne?

[''The demon leaves a letter with King's name on it and departs. Hooty looks at the letter (a bug walking over it) and gasps.'']

'''Hooty:''' OH MY GOSH, A BUG!

[''He eats the bug and the letter in one bite.'']

'''Hooty:''' Ahhhh. Whoopsie! Hope that was junk mail!

[''In a classroom, a levitating skeleton illusion with organs inside it can be seen. A young [[Gus Porter|Gus]] then places a plaque under it, which reads: [[The Titan|THE TITAN]]; MEAT TYRANT; OR; VEGGIE KING. The skeleton is then revealed to be holding a chicken leg on one hand, and celery on the other as a teacher walks by and sees it.'']

'''Illusion teacher:''' Very nice work. And how is working with your partner?

'''Young Gus:''' No prob. We're practically best friends now.

'''Illusion teacher:''' Then I think you'll do just fine in this class. [''walks off'']

'''Young Gus:''' [''proudly''] You've done it again, Augustus. [''looks at the skeleton'']

[''Two students then walk in, both from the illusion track. One of them, the dark-haired boy, is holding two books between his armpits as he listens to his friend speaking.'']

'''Orange-haired student:''' Yeah, I killed it in fantasy grudgby this weekend.

'''Dark-haired student:''' You just.. didn't do the assignment?

'''Orange-haired student:''' I got the new prodigy to do it for me. And all I had to do was ''pretend'' to be his friend. Hmm? 

[''Someone sniffles, which is revealed to be Gus, upset that someone only used him to do the assignment. He dispels the illusion, grabs his bag and runs away in tears.'']

'''Orange-haired student:''' Aw, come on, dude! It was just a joke!

[''Gus runs inside a classroom and sits down dejectedly.'']

'''Young Gus:''' You've done it again, Augustus. Why does this keep happening? [''bangs his head accidentally on the desk behind him; a book from above it hits him''] Ow! [''his eyes turn blue''] Oh, no. No, no, not this! 

[''Illusions of the two students who he encountered earlier escape from behind him and he projects a wide illusion of the forest as the two students approach him'']

'''Orange-haired student illusion:''' [''laughs''] Aww, the poor ''wittle'' baby got his ''feewings'' hurt.

'''Dark-haired student illusion:''' Talent can't make up for gullibility. [''the two laugh at Gus, making him feel more dejected'']

[''Just then, they hear another voice, attempting to communicate with Gus.'']

'''Unknown student:''' Um.. [''different voice''] Hello there. [''an abomination waves slowly at Gus; its hand suddenly melts, revealing the bone of a finger'']

[''Someone chuckles and reveals themselves from another desk; it turns out to be a younger [[Willow Park|Willow]].'']

'''Young Willow:''' Sorry, I- I was trying to be funny, but, I just ended up being horrifying. I.. thought I was the only one that hid here.

'''Dark-haired student illusion:''' Uh, who's that?

'''Orange-haired student illusion:''' You might as well just do her homework now. Get it over with.

'''Young Gus:''' [''covers his head''] Go away!

'''Young Willow:''' [''confused''] Are you talking to me?

'''Young Gus:''' ''All'' of you!

[''Willow smiles, purges through the illusion and sits beside Gus.'']

'''Young Willow:''' Hey. Sometimes I get wrapped up in my own thoughts too. But my dads taught me a little trick to quiet the voices. 

[''She starts inhaling, her hands counting from 1 to 4, and exhaling as her hands count back to 1. Gus follows the second time, and after, his eyes turn normal again. The illusions start to disappear.'']

'''Orange-haired student illusion:''' Huh? No, no, I don't wanna go! 

[''He and the dark-haired student scream as they disappear and the wide illusion disappears. The classroom returns back to normal.'']

'''Young Willow:''' I'm Willow. [''offers her hand to him; he takes it'']

'''Young Gus:''' Augustus. [''the two shake hands'']

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|MAIN THEME]], but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.''']

[''Outside the principal's office, [[Mattholomule]] walks out, having joined the illusion track, and walks off proudly. The Blight twins also come out, [[Edric Blight|Edric]] having joined the beast keeping and potions track, and [[Emira Blight|Emira]], the healing track. Edric proudly presents his new colors to Emira as they hi-five each other and walk off. Cut to inside the principal's office. [[Principal Bump]] is rummaging through folders in a drawer, and the illusion teacher looks back proudly.'']

'''Illusion teacher:''' It's nice to see the kids embracing multitracks. I remember giving up everything for illusions. [''looks dejectedly at the illusion coven sigil on her wrist as she hands a folder to Bump'']

'''Principal Bump:''' To be honest, I thought this would be more trouble than it's worth. But I haven't seen students this enthusiastic, ever.

[''A hooded person suddenly walks inside, catching the illusion teacher and Bump's attention.'']

'''Hooded person:''' Well... trouble.. might be closer than you think. [''shows a medallion with the [[Coven System|illusion coven]] brand on it'']

[''Cut to the cafeteria. [[Amity Blight|Amity]] shows Willow and Gus the messages from [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] on her game device.'']

'''Amity:''' These are the last messages I got from Luz. [''cut to a view of the trio, looking worried''] She must've typed them quickly, because all I could decipher was, "Learned a lot of bad stuff," something, something, "Day of Unity," something, something and, "Don't scare 'em away"? I don't know what any of it means.

'''Gus:''' What about all those hearts? [''Amity quickly blushes'']

'''Amity:''' Oh. [''chuckles''] Those are for me.

'''Willow:''' I went by and checked out the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]]. It was crawling with [[Coven Scout|Coven Scouts]]. I was thinking of capturing one for information, but...

'''Amity:''' It's okay, Willow. They're tough. Not everyone can stand up to them.

'''Willow:''' [''squints suspiciously''] But I didn't want to bring any more attention to Luz and [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]].

'''Amity:''' Oh! [''awkwardly''] Of course, yes. Smart move.

[''From somewhere, the bell screams and rings. Amity picks up her food tray and walks off with a decent expression on her face, as Willow follows her with a dejected expression.'']

'''Gus:''' [''to Willow''] Hey. You should say something.

'''Willow:''' I'm fine. We just started hanging out again, and, she needs time to get to know the new me.

'''Gus:''' You mean the real you. [''winks at Willow'']

'''Willow:''' Mm-hmm. [''she winks back and walks off'']

[''As Willow walks off with Amity, Gus has just scooped up his lunch when he hears rattling from the trash bin. He turns around to look at it, and out comes [[Flapjack]] with a half-eaten sandwich on his beak and chirps.'']

'''Gus:''' [''gasps''] I remember you!

[''Flapjack chirps, drops the sandwich and runs off. Gus pockets his lunch, summons his [[Witch's Staff|staff]] and rides on it.'']

'''Gus:''' Wait, get back here! 

[''Flapjack flies through the hallways as Gus follows him, and he eventually ends up in the Paranoratorium, [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside's]] closed theater. Upon landing, Gus looks around, armed with his staff. Suddenly, someone comes up behind him, and he gasps. The figure steps forward. It's revealed to be [[Hunter]], with a hood and looking rather disheveled.'']

'''Gus:''' What are you doing here, Golden Guard?

'''Hunter:''' Wouldn't you like to know. [''chuckles''] But rest assured, Gus, I--

[''Both hear clattering sounds as Gus looks behind Hunter, confused. Behind him, Gus spots a few packets of Hex Mix and a few books. Hunter instead attempts to hides it with his cape, embarrassed.'']

'''Gus:''' I'll ask you one more time. What are you doing here, Hunter? 

[''Hunter does not speak until Flapjack flies across him and bites his singed hair, making his hood come off.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''angrily''] Ow, ow, ow, ow! Okay, fine! [''stares angrily at Flapjack as he perches himself on Hunter's shoulder''] Truth is, my living situation has been compromised. ''Maybe.'' So I just need a place to crash. ''Temporarily!'' Hexside.. was the only place I could think of.

'''Gus:''' How... vague of you. Do you know where Luz is, by any chance?

'''Hunter:''' [''surprised''] She's... not with the Owl Lady?

[''Just then, Bump's voice rings out from the speakers.'']

'''Principal Bump:''' [''from speakers''] Students, please join me in the gym for an important announcement.

'''Gus:''' [''summons his lunch bag and hands it to Hunter''] I'm not sure what you're going through, but that much Hex Mix can't be good for your stomach.

[''Hunter looks inside the bag to find an orange, an apple and a sandwich. Gus runs off as Hunter looks at him. Cut to inside the gym, where the students are gathered into a crowd. Gus enters.'']

'''[[Viney]]:''' What's going on?

[''Above the stage is the illusion teacher, the hooded figure from earlier, and Bump.'']

'''Principal Bump:''' Uh, students, teachers, let me introduce the esteemed-

'''Hooded figure:''' Please, Principal Bump, I deserve no accolades. 

[''The hooded figure steps forward and takes off his hood.'']

'''Adrian:''' Hello everyone, my name is Adrian Graye, Head Witch of the Illusionist Coven.

[''The students gasp and start muttering worriedly.'']

'''Adrian:''' Unfortunately, I'm not here with good news. The [[Emperor's Coven]] has plans to stop multitrack studies, by inducting every Hexside student into a coven, before the Day of Unity.

[''Everyone gasps in shock. Viney, [[Barcus]] and [[Jerbo]] look at each other worriedly.'']

'''Mattholomule:''' Mother Titan! [''rips off his sleeves and crosses his arms grumpily'']

'''Principal Bump:''' Don't worry. No one's magic is going to be sealed away. Head Witch Graye supports us, and has come to help.

[''Upon hearing this, Mattholomule takes back his sleeves, puts them on, and crosses his arms again, embarrassed. A teacher then comes up to Edric and takes him by the shoulder.'']

'''Adrian:''' Before any Coven Scouts come by, I'm going to make illusions of sigils on your wrists. [''a hesitant Edric is led into the stage''] They'll be temporary, and harmless.

'''Edric:''' Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, I just started the other tracks. Are you sure this is safe?

'''Adrian:''' Don't worry, once a scout sees the fake sigil, they'll move on, and you can continue your studies in peace. [''Edric, still hesitant, rolls up his sleeve and shows his wrist''] Now hold still.

[''Adrian draws a spell circle in the air and aims it towards Edric's wrist. Gus get suspicious of this, but then he sees illusion magic brandishing Adrian's hand. Gus realizes this is a trap.'']

'''Gus:''' [''gasps''] Stop! [''everyone looks at him''] Don't trust him! He's hiding behind an illusion! 

[''Gus draws a huge spell circle, and aims it towards the stage. The illusion dispels and Adrian is revealed to be a Scout Captain in disguise. Edric fearfully shields his wrist as the illusion teacher and Bump step forward and protect him. The illusion teacher and the captain draw spell circles simultaneously, when suddenly, the real Adrian's voice can be heard.'']

'''Adrian:''' Cut! [''the teacher and the Coven Scout call off their spell circles in surprise''] Just... just cut. 

[''From the bleachers in the gym, Coven Scouts start appearing, to the shock and disturbance of the students. Some Coven Scouts also appear on stage too, a few handling the lights, and a few handling vocals. The real Adrian then appears, in a director's seat, in the middle of the stage. Adrian is holding a cup of coffee and looks like he's about to laugh.'']

'''Adrian:''' All right, couple of notes. Tom, [''walks over to a Coven Scout''] that Adrian illusion was lacking a certain, hmm? You get me? [''Tom shrugs in confusion''] Severine! That was really... poor, work. You're on thin ice. [''Severine whimpers''] Captain, [''walks over to the captain, who was pretending to be Adrian''] the read of your last line was just a little... mm. [''gestures'']

'''Guard Captain:''' I don't know what that means.

'''Adrian:''' [''hands him the cup of coffee and winks''] You'll figure it out. [''teleports beside Gus''] And you. Well, you just ruined any chance we had of making this, something.

'''Gus:''' You were gonna trick us into getting sigils! [''he attempts to escape Adrian's tight grip unsuccessfully; a Coven Scout hands Adrian a glove with a coven sigil on it, which he wears'']

'''Adrian:''' Uh, yeah. I work for [[Emperor Belos|Belos]]. Kind of my job. But let's make sure you [''the brand on his glove changes from illusion to abomination''] can never use your little illusion tricks again... [''sinisterly''] shall we?

[''Everyone gasps, horrified. Gus attempts to escape Adrian's grip again as Adrian's glove slowly reaches to his wrist.'']

'''Gus:''' No, no, stay back! I said, stay.. BACK! 

[''The word "back" echoes, and his eyes glow blue again. He projects yet another wide illusion, but this time, the illusion keeps shifting locations, confusing everyone. Everyone starts running in different directions. Adrian looks at Gus, astonished.'']

'''Adrian:''' How are you doing this?! 

[''Gus attempts to escape his grip again. Just then, Hunter passes through the illusion and pushes Adrian out of the way, taking Gus with him as they both disappear. Adrian recovers, then uses an earring that looks like a mirror, draws a spell circle with it and steadies the illusion. It has brought him and a few other scouts, however, into the [[Looking Glass Ruins]].'']

'''Guard Captain:''' Head Witch. It looks like the whole school is covered in a giant...

'''Adrian:''' ...Illusion. Hmm. 

[''He walks over and examines a statue. When he touches it, however, it simply passes through his hand. He smirks.'']

'''Adrian:''' Find that boy, the one who.. did.. this.

'''Guard Captain:''' This is a complicated spell. I-If we could have some direction...

'''Adrian:''' Am I the only one who knows how to do their job? Just figure.. it out! [''scans the statue again''] Would you look at this? The detail is just so... pow!

'''Guard Captain:''' I hate working for this guy.

[''Cut to black. Cut again to the shifting illusion. Willow and Amity run through it as they attempt to escape. Eventually, the illusion steadies and they are seen in the carnival.'']

'''Amity:''' Whoa, what? How did we get here? 

[''The two start to look around as Amity summons her scroll. Willow walks towards a nearby wall and touches it.'']

'''Willow:''' I think it's an illusion.

'''Amity:''' I just got a text from Ed. He, Bump and a bunch of others are in the Healing Homeroom. [''makes her scroll disappear''] We should find our way over.

[''A Coven Scout suddenly looms behind Willow'']

'''Amity:''' Willow, watch out!

[''She attempts to draw a spell circle in the air, but the Coven Scout is suddenly trapped in vines, having been summoned by Willow.'']

'''Willow:''' [''chuckles''] I got it.

'''Amity:''' Lucky shot, Willow. [''walks off'']

[''Willow stares at Amity, concerned.'']

'''Coven Scout:''' Hey, don't listen to her. You totally got me. 

[''In another place somewhere at the school, Hunter and Gus are also running through the shifting illusion, when it finally steadies and they are seen somewhere in the streets of [[Bonesborough]]. Suddenly, they bump into a wall, which actually turns out to be one of the lockers, and they fall to the ground.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''groans''] Why are we here? [''Gus stands up, and he becomes astonished''] Whoa, Gus. Wha-- Is your eye okay?

[''One of Gus' eyes is revealed to be blue; he rubs his eyes in confusion and looks again. Cut to Gus' perspective; the blue eye can see through his illusions while the other cannot.'']

'''Gus:''' My spell, it's still active.

'''Hunter:''' [''stands up''] Well, you're a witch... unspell it.

'''Gus:''' No, I- I don't know how, I've never made one this big before.

'''Hunter:''' Well, if we're still in Hexside, [''he guides himself through the wall''] we should find a teacher. [''Gus follows him as the two walk off''] Maybe they'll know how to help.

'''Gus:''' Hunter, why'd you save me back there? From getting a sigil? Don't those guys work for you?

'''Hunter:''' I owed you. For the food. [''they stop at a staircase''] Are these real steps or illusion steps?

[''Hunter tries skipping over it, but immediately falls down the stairs, groaning. Gus looks horrified.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''weakly''] Real steps.

'''Gus:''' [''walks down the stairs; guiding himself through the wall beside him''] When we first met you were trying to ''trick'' me into joining a coven. And now you're helping me ''stay away'' from one... 'cause of a.. sandwich?

'''Hunter:''' [''walks away''] It was a good sandwich. 

'''Gus:''' No sandwich is ''that'' good. [''follow Hunter, who still refuses to speak''] Come on, if we wanna find a way through this, we need to trust each other. What's going on with you?

[''The two eventually stop walking. Hunter is about to tell something when someone interrupts them.'']

'''Hunter:''' I..

'''Coven Scout:''' Hey! It's the kid! 

[''Upon spotting two Coven Scouts in front of them, Hunter immediately summons his staff and attacks one of the scouts, but gets intercepted when abomination goo, summoned by the other scout, takes his staff and traps his body in goo. The scout attempts to take the staff, but it immediately transforms into Flapjack and flies around him, trying to distract him.'']

'''Gus:''' Hunter! [''tries to run towards Hunter but is restrained by the other scout in vines'']

[''A Coven Scout approaches Hunter but stops upon recognizing him.'']

'''Coven Scout 1:''' Wait, aren't you the Golden Guard?

'''Coven Scout 2:''' Seriously? Dude, what the heck? We're on the same side.

'''Coven Scout 1:''' Our deepest apologies, sir. [''calls off the abomination goo, freeing Hunter''] The [[Emperor Belos|Emperor]] sent out a search party for you, he's been worried sick.

[''At the mention of Belos, Hunter immediately flinches, and tries to hide it.'']

'''Hunter:''' [''hesitantly''] You don't say...

[''Flapjack immediately flies towards Gus and begins chipping his vines. Meanwhile, Gus spots some leftover abomination goo in front of his feet.'']

'''Coven Scout 2:''' I'd be honored to escort you back to the castle, sir. I'm sure the Emperor would be thrilled to know you're okay. Say.. why aren't you in uniform?

[''Gus is then shown drawing a fire glyph using the abomination goo in front of his feet and upon finishing it, activates it. Hunter is then shown looking nervous.'']

'''Hunter:''' Uh, I-- 

[''Before he can finish, a wave of fire hits the Coven Scouts, making them fall down. Hunter is taken by surprise as the wave barely passes him.'']

'''Gus:''' Follow me! [''runs off; Hunter and Flapjack follow him'']

[''The Coven Scouts chase after them as they run into a tangible wall, confusing the Coven Scouts. Scene then cuts to the two panting behind the door, and they are shown to be in Gus' room. Hunter starts panicking once more.'']

'''Hunter:''' Oh Titan! He's looking for me! He'll know I'm here. I-I g-gotta run. I-I gotta hide! I g- [''breathing heavily'']

[''Gus puts his hand on Hunter's shoulder, which makes Hunter stop hyperventilating and look up at him.'']

'''Gus:''' Hey. Try to breathe. Like this.

[Gus repeats the technique that Willow showed him; he starts inhaling, ''counting from 1 to 4, and then exhales and counts back to 1. He repeats as Hunter follows along, eventually calming down.]''

'''Gus:''' Did you run away from the Emperor's Coven?

'''Hunter:''' [''nods'']

'''Gus:''' Why?

[''Hunter opens his mouth to speak, reconsiders, glares at Gus, then buries his face in his arms.'']

'''Gus:''' Not too long ago, when I showed a little talent and started taking more advanced classes, it always felt like anyone who wanted to be my friend had an ulterior motive. Until I met Willow. And, eventually Luz, and some others. [''He gets up and walks toward pictures of him with Luz, Willow, and even Mattholomule.''] So yeah, not everybody's great, but not everybody's bad either, y'know? For what it's worth, you can trust me. I promise not to mess with you.

'''Hunter:''' [''scoffs''] That's not worth anything. Stop acting foolish.

'''Gus:''' All right, tough guy. Let's keep moving then.

[''Gus walks through the wall, Hunter stands and looks at Gus' pictures, then turns to leave. The scene cuts back to Willow and Amity as a Coven scout is thrown across the screen. The Guard Captain then summons a rock scout from the ground and lunges it towards the girls.'']

'''Willow:''' I got this! [''draws a spell circle on the ground'']

'''Amity:''' No, I got this! [''she too draws a spell circle'']

[''Willow's magic summons vines and Amity's magic summons an abomination, but the vines end up impaling the abomination; the rock scout nearly hits the girls, who dodge the attack as the rock scout slides through the wall.'']

'''Willow:''' [''frustrated''] What are you doing?

'''Amity:''' I just got you back as a friend. Let me protect you!

[''A bookshelf appears above Amity. It nearly topples on her before it's caught by Willow. She summons vines to both keep the bookshelf from crushing her, and knocking out the Guard Captain.'']

'''Willow:''' [''grunts''] I don't want your protection! I want you to see who I really am!

[''She pushes the bookshelf aside; the illusion teacher, Edric and Emira open a way out of the illusion as Bump appears in front of them.'']

'''Principal Bump:''' Come quick!

[''Willow runs past Amity, holding her arm in pain, Amity soon follows her. Scene cuts back to Gus and Hunter as they run into the school hallway.'']

'''Hunter:''' Is this...real?

'''Gus:''' [''touches a water fountain and gets gum stuck on his hand; he groans in disgust''] Yes! Yeah, we made it through the illusion! High five! 

[''Hunter confusingly raises his hand to Gus, which he slaps, causing him to grunt; "Willow" is seen walking through the halls and stops as she notices the boys'']

'''Gus:''' Willow! You're okay! 

'''Willow:''' Augustus! I've been looking everywhere for you! [''notices Hunter''] Whoa, what is he doing here? 

'''Gus:''' Oh, don't worry. It's cool. He helped me escape from Graye. [''whispers''] I think he ran away from the Emperor's Coven. Also, he hasn't showered. In a while. Be nice.  

'''Willow:''' Interesting. Anyway, let's find the others before these illusions get any more...[''squeals''] 

[''Hunter looks at her suspiciously''] 

'''Gus:''' Okay, let's get moving. 

[''Hunter summons his staff and teleports in front of the two.''] 

'''Hunter:''' Who are you? 

'''Gus:''' [''stands in front of "Willow"''] What are you doing? Willow's on our side! 

'''Hunter:''' That's not the captain. 

'''Willow:''' You're scaring me, Hunter! 

'''Hunter:''' Have you ever seen her play Flyer Derby? There's no way she'd be afraid of ''me''. 

[''Gus starts to back away from her.''] 

'''Adrian:''' Oh, again? Cut! 

[''Willow reveals that she is Severine in disguise''] 

'''Adrian:''' Severine! [''Severine squeaks in surprise''] You had your chance, and you blew it! Not that I'm surprised.  

'''Severine:''' But I-I followed all your notes. 

'''Adrian:''' Well, he was still able to see through your shoddy performance. So maybe you should've figured out the note ''inside'' the note. [''Severine walks away, whining''] And you two, are making my job very difficult. 

[''Hunter and Gus run away from Graye, but are halted in their tracks by Belos''] 

'''Hunter:''' [''fearfully''] Belos... 

[''Graye kicks Hunter to the ground and grabs Gus by the arms. He holds Hunter down with his foot and snaps his fingers to summon the two scouts casting Belos as an illusion.''] 

'''Hunter:''' I command you to stop! 

[''The scouts stop advancing on him.''] 

'''Scout:''' Technically, he is our superior. 

'''Adrian:''' Well, right now he's just a runaway, and our dearest Emperor wants him back. So tie him up. 

[''The two pick up Hunter, who proceeds to kick the scout and headbutt the Captain.''] 

'''Guard Captain:''' [''groans''] Just put him- 

'''Scout:''' Out of his misery? Gotten! [''draws a spell circle''] 

'''Guard Captain:''' To sleep, dude! To sleep! 

'''Scout:''' Oh, yeah. Right, right. [''he summons a flute and plays a tune that expels a gas''] 

[''The gas causes Hunter to slowly close his eyes. When he opens them, the scene changes to the Healing Homeroom with Flapjack looking down on him, he is soon accompanied by [[Skara]] and Viney.'']     

'''Skara:''' He's waking up!     

[''Hunter sits up and rubs his head in pain. He looks around the room and is surprised. Cut to a view of the room. Barcus is licking a scar on one of his paws, while beside him is Jerbo, his leg being wrapped around with a gauze roll. Bump is damping a wet cloth onto Mattholomule's arm. Emira is then shown summoning a spell circle and holding it up to a part of Edric's scraped head. Willow is then shown getting a part of her arm healed by Cat. After looking calm for a while, Hunter starts to get up.'']     

'''Hunter:''' [''gasps''] T-This.. This is an illusion! Gus! Are you- ah!      

[''He tries to stands up, but falls to the floor and groans. Viney and Skara help him up.'']     

'''Viney:''' Whoa! It's okay. Try not to stand so fast.     

'''Skara:''' This isn't an illusion. You're in the Healing Homeroom.      

[''Bump approaches Hunter with a distrustful look on his face.'']     

'''Principal Bump:''' Well, Mr. Golden Guard.     

'''Hunter:''' [''manages to stand up''] Hunter. [''Flapjack flies up to him and perches on his shoulder'']     

'''Principal Bump:''' We saw you being dragged around, and the flyer derby team was determined to save you. [''Hunter looks at Skara and Viney, surprised''] But I am not yet convinced of your innocence. Where have your scouts taken Augustus?     

[''Everyone is now eyeing Hunter with suspicious and distrustful looks on their faces, except Viney and Skara.'']     

'''Edric:''' ''That's'' the Golden Guard?     

'''Emira:''' [''whispers to Edric''] Dude looks sickly.     

'''Mattholomule:''' [''pops out from behind Edric''] I could probably take him.     

'''Barcus:''' [''barks and growls lowly''] [''Subtitles: He's not to be trusted'']     

'''Hunter:''' I- I'm not with them, I swear! I was with Gus the whole time. I was trying to get him to you.     

'''Illusion teacher:''' Maybe we can trade him for Augustus. I'm sure the Emperor would want him back.      

[''Hunter flinches at this. Scene cuts to Willow, exercising her arm which had just been healed.'']     

'''Hunter:''' I'm not lying, Gus was showing me around. T-There was a sandwich, he showed me this breathing thing.      

[''Upon hearing about the breathing technique, Willow realizes he's not lying.'']      

'''Hunter:''' Please, you gotta believe me!      

[''Willow puts a hand on his shoulder.'']     

'''Willow:''' He's telling the truth. [''smiles at Hunter, then steps forward''] And he can help us drive Head Witch Graye and his scouts out of the school. [''looks at Hunter'']     

'''Hunter:''' Y-Yes! Um, Graye said he'll be in the gym. But he will be guarded.     

'''Amity:''' [''stands up''] That won't be a problem. Willow can bust through anything. [''Willow smiles, now knowing Amity trusts her fully'']     

'''Willow:''' Yeah. But I'll need help.      

[''Amity starts walking towards her but Mattholomule reaches her first.'']     

'''Mattholomule:''' Say no more, I'm on it. [''Willow eyes him sheepishly'']     

'''Principal Bump:''' [''sighs''] Let's just come up with a plan.     

'''Skara:''' Yes! [''starts clapping excitedly''] This is my favorite part!     

[''Cut to outside the gym, which is enveloped in an illusion of a forest. Coven Scouts are guarding the door.'']     

'''Adrian:''' And yes, at first, I thought that fooling children was a waste of my impressive talents.      

[''Scene cuts to inside the gym, which is enveloped inside an illusion of the Looking Glass Ruins. Adrian keeps pacing back and forth in front of a captive Gus, being held by two Coven Scouts.'']     

'''Adrian:''' But I realized that a true genius can find the art in everything he does and-- [''realizes Gus is not paying attention to him''] Hey. Hey!     

[''The captive Gus is looking rather guilt-ridden and hopeless.'']     

'''Gus:''' [''sighs disappointedly''] You've done it again, Augustus. You can't even tell Willow apart from the fake one. [''Adrian snaps his fingers in front of him'']     

'''Adrian:''' Yoo-hoo. Come on. Are you listening? This is ''my'' monologue. Now, this- is- ''your''- doing?     

'''Gus:''' [''turns away guiltily''] Yeah. It's all my fault.     

'''Adrian:''' Oh. Right. All about you. Now how about telling ''me'' how ''you'' know about the Looking Glass Graveyard? I've been looking for the Galdorstones. [''walks over to a statue and touches it''] They'd make great gifts for the Emperor. Where did you say you found them? [''no response from Gus, who looks at him angrily instead''] Ah. Boring.      

[''He gestures towards the Coven Scouts and they hold Gus to the point where his arms are tied. Adrian then takes his mirror-shaped earring.'']     

'''Adrian:''' See this mirror? It's a handy little magic amplifier. [''draws a spell circle''] It'll help me sort through those little memories of yours.     

[''He then aims the spell circle towards Gus using the mirror-shaped earring. Gus starts writhing in pain.'']     

'''Gus:''' [''groans''] Ah, stop! Wait, this hurts!     

'''Adrian:''' Oh, don't be so dramatic.      

[''The illusion all around the school dispels through a large orb, startling the Coven Scouts outside guarding. Back inside the gym, Adrian looks around.'']     

'''Adrian:''' Hmm. Well, that's one less thing to worry about. Now, where were we?      

[''Upon turning around, however, he discovers Gus's eyes are now both blue. He starts creating an orb that grows rapidly. Adrian and the others step back in shock. Back outside the gym, a Guard Captain looks towards his left, and spots Principal Bump walking towards them.'']     

'''Guard Captain:''' [''blocks the path''] Gym is off-limits. Graye's orders.     

'''Principal Bump:''' Graye may be Head Witch, but I'm still ''principal''. It'd be wise to let me through.     

'''Guard Captain:''' [''chuckles and aims his spear towards Bump''] Oh, yeah?     

'''Principal Bump:''' [''Frewin comes out his head and aims it towards the guard captain''] Yeah.     

[''Behind him, an illusion dispels. Hunter, Willow, Amity and a few other students then appear, with a few abomination and creatures, like Puddles. Upon seeing this, the Guard Captain immediately whistles and a few other Coven Scouts appear behind the battalion.'']     

'''Guard Captain:''' Get 'em!      

[''The fight commences. A Coven Scout attacks first, but Bump blocks him with magic. Another Coven Scout appears and attempts to attack Hunter, but he simply teleports behind him and he shoves the Coven Scout off. An abomination attempts to attack another Coven Scout, but he slashes it. Suddenly, Puddles lands on top of him, with Viney and Skara riding him.'']     

'''Skara:''' Yeah!      

[''She attacks an incoming Coven Scout beside her, but a vine suddenly wraps Puddles's leg, causing both Skara and Viney to get thrown away. Emira immediately runs over and starts to heal Skara. A Coven Scout attempts to attack them, but he is suddenly countered by an abomination summoned by Amity, who smiles at them; they smiles back. She runs off, controlling the abomination. Behind her, Edric and Barcus carry a handful of potions which they throw at the Coven Scouts. Jerbo is shown chasing after some Coven Scouts with his own abomination. Mattholomule is then showing defending himself, summoning walls which the incoming Coven Scouts hit. Afterwards, he blows away his spell circle and smirks proudly. Just then, the wall behind him cracks as an incoming Coven Scout attempts to attack him, but is suddenly trapped and raised by vines, summoned by Willow as she flings them. A Coven Scout attempts to attack beside her but Hunter teleports behind him and throws him away. A wave of energy summoned by the Guard Captain suddenly hits everyone, ending the battle.'']     

'''Guard Captain:''' Enough! I will NOT be cowed by a group of students!      

[''A mix of abomination goo and vines suddenly hit his face; he is then trapped in a wall. Willow and Amity step forward as they call off their summons.'']     

'''Willow:''' Then how about just the two of us? [''she and Amity pose together'']     

'''Amity:''' Nice one!      

[''Hunter suddenly runs in front of them and out of sight. Unbeknownst to everyone, the guard captain pulls out an [[Abomaton]] controller and presses a button on it. Hunter kicks the door open to find the glowing orb, Adrian and the two Coven Scouts lying on the floor in pain.'']     

'''Adrian:''' [''groans''] Make it stop. Make it stop! I don't.. like these memories... [''lies down to reveal a curled-up Gus'']     

[''Willow and Amity rush inside.'']     

'''Amity:''' What's going on?     

'''Willow:''' Gus is trapped in his head! And the others are being affected too!      

[''The three suddenly hear loud thumping and turn around. Scene then reveals an Abomaton tearing his way inside the gym. All the other students behind it are now trapped in abomination goo. The Guard Captain enters with the controller.'']     

'''Guard Captain:''' [''laughs''] I needed a reason to play with one of these!     

[''The Abomaton advances on the trio and starts revealing its weapons.'']     

'''Amity:''' I ''really'' have to talk to my parents about this. [''she and Willow summon their palismen'']     

'''Willow:''' We'll hold them off. You save Gus.     

'''Hunter:''' But- how?      

[''Hunter looks at Gus determinedly and runs towards the orb as Willow and Amity begin fighting the Abomaton. Hunter passes a groaning Adrian and sees Gus, his face buried in his knees. Right after his staff morphs into Flapjack, he touches the orb, and flashes back to some of his memories [[Hollow Mind|inside Belos' mindscape]]. He struggles to fight it and eventually does, purging through the illusion and reaching Gus. However, when he touches his shoulder, the background immediately changes and shifts through various locations again. He then finds himself inside the forest, but turns around and spots Gus, inside the detention room, looking guilty.'']     

'''Gus:''' What's wrong with me? Why can't I learn?     

'''Hunter:''' Gus! [''He approaches him only for the background to change into white. He turns around again, and finds illusions of [[Bria]], [[Gavin]] and [[Angmar]] circling around Gus.'']     

'''Gus:''' I let myself get tricked... again.      

[''The whole illusion vanishes as the background changes into white once more. Hunter turns around again to find Gus staring to himself in three mirrors.'']     

'''Gus:''' Everyone thinks I'm the smart one. So why do I keep acting so dumb?     

'''Hunter:''' Gus, can you hear me?      

[''The illusion fades again. Hunter, seemingly lost, looks around and steps back. The background now changes to show Gus's room. The real Gus appears, burying his face in his knees.'']     

'''Gus:''' I can't even trust myself anymore. [''Hunter sits beside him'']     

'''Hunter:''' It's... hard, when you can't trust yourself. I spent my whole life believing I was doing something good for ''someone'' good... but it was a lie. And some part of me still wants to.. believe in that lie, just like you wanna believe you're dumb, or, whatever. But it's not true. [''an anguished Gus raises his head and looks at him''] I promise. I wouldn't mess with you. Uh, now, uh, how did that breathing thing go again?     

[''He starts inhaling deeply and whistling, which makes Gus laugh. Gus's blue eyes return back to normal, and the illusion finally fades completely. Hunter and Gus stand up and look around. Willow, Amity and a few other students manage to subdue the Abomaton. Willow and Amity look at each other and grin, then turn around and see Gus and Hunter.'']     

'''Willow:''' Gus! [''runs towards him and hugs him''] Aww, I'm so glad you're okay!     

'''Gus:''' Me too.      

[''Hunter attempts to walk away sheepishly but is pulled into a hug by Willow and Gus, much to his embarrassment.'']     

'''Willow:''' Thanks, Hunter.     

'''Hunter:''' [''blushing''] What is.. this?     

'''Gus:''' Just go with it.     

[''Cut to outside the school. The Coven Scouts preapre to leave. Two of them are dragging a traumatized and whimpering Adrian inside the ship. The Guard Captain looks back.'']     

'''Guard Captain:''' When Emperor Belos catches wind of this...     

'''Principal Bump:''' [''proudly''] I'm sure he'll be thrilled to learn one of his captains was defeated... by a couple teenagers.     

[''The captain groans, then sees Severine walking away.'']     

'''Guard Captain:''' Severine! Get on that ship or you'll be walking back to the castle!      

[''Severine has finally had enough.'']     

'''Severine:''' You know what? It has been.. a rough year, and my self-esteem.. can only take so much! I QUIT! [''throws her mask to the floor, revealing her cat-like head and walks away''] I'm going back to the Tiny Cat Coven.     

[''The whole school starts cheering and clapping as the ship finally leaves. Hunter and Gus watch it leave as they are approached by Willow and Amity.'']     

'''Amity:''' [''to Gus''] I can't believe you took down a coven head.     

'''Gus:''' Yeah. and I almost went down with him.     

'''Hunter:''' Is Graye gonna be alright?     

'''Gus:''' Uh... [''shrugs''] probably? [''he and Hunter chuckle'']     

'''Skara:''' Hunter!      

[''The four turn around to see the students approaching Hunter.'']      

'''Skara:''' What's going on at the castle?     

'''Viney:''' Did you actually leave the Emperor's Coven?     

'''Edric:''' Have you ever sneezed with your mask on?     

'''Barcus:''' [''barks''] [''Subtitles: The people crave the truth'']     

[''Hunter looks hesitant at first, but then looks at Gus; they both smile.'']     

'''Hunter:''' [''inhales deeply''] [''to Skara''] Everyone in the castle is traveling to the head for the [[Day of Unity]]. [''to Viney''] I... think I did. [''to Edric''] Yes?     

'''Edric:''' That's gross, man.     

'''Hunter:''' Listen. Emperor Belos has been lying to everyone. The Day of Unity isn't about the Titan or magic. It's much scarier than that.     

[''Everyone has worried expressions on their faces upon hearing this. Willow and Amity look at each other, then hold hands.'']     

'''Hunter:''' Sorry... there's a lot to explain.      

'''Principal Bump:''' [''approaches Hunter''] Then you'd better get started.     

[''Hunter, Willow, Amity and Gus look at him worriedly.'']

[''[[King]] opens his eyes, finding himself in what appears to be the [[In Between Realm]] that [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] [[Yesterday's Lie|previously found herself in]].'']

'''King:''' Heh?

[''King hears a laugh. It seemed to be coming from the [[Collector]].'']

'''The Collector:''' Almost free, almost free!

'''King:''' Luz? [[Hooty]]? Woah, woah! Is someone there?

'''The Collector:''' I won't be alone, I won't be alone anymore! [cackles]

'''King:''' Hello, hello?

'''The Collector:''' Who said that? Who's there?

'''King:''' What...?

'''The Collector:''' Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Don't leave! Come back-!

[''King wakes up back on the boat, confused. Luz had just awaken him from his dream.'']

'''King:''' [''gasping and breathing heavily'']

'''Luz:''' Hey, sleepy head. We're back in [[Bonesborough]].

[''King looks out from the edge of the ship and looks at the bones of the [[The Titan|Titan]], coming to terms again that he's one of them.'']

[<nowiki/>[[The Owl House Main Theme|'''Main Theme''']]]

[''Luz waves and exits the boat and pulls out her little device. She's received a lot of texts from [[Amity Blight|Amity]]. Hooty is in his portable state and he's looming over her shoulder.'']

'''Luz:''' Hmmm. "Mom took Pensta, but we're safe. We'll contact." Aww, she sent so many hearts! Hope she's doing okay. 

'''King:''' Is that Amity? It's okay if you wanna check on her. I can get to the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] on my own.

[''Luz has a flashback to the events from the previous episode.'']

'''Flashback King:''' I think they might be my family! Maybe they're an answer to all our problems!

'''Flashback [[Bill]]:''' If you think [[Emperor Belos|Belos]] is evil, you've never seen a live Titan.

'''Flashback Luz:''' King, you're not one of them.

'''Flashback King:''' Then what am I?!

'''Flashback Luz:''' You're a Titan, King. You're the son of the [[Boiling Isles]]. [''This greatly shocks King.'']

[''Back to the present time.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hey, look! Everyone missed us so much they put up pretty signs!

[''Four wanted posted are displayed on the screen. One featuring a demonically drawn [[Hooty]], another of [[Eda Clawthorne|Harpy Eda]], then one with Luz casting a [[Light Glyph|glyph]] [[Light Glyph|spell]] with King next to her, and the last one featuring [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] holding fire in her hand. Two witches growl at what seems to be Hooty.'']

'''Luz:''' [''pulls her hood up''] Let's take the long way home.

[King, Luz, and Hooty retreat back to the Owl House. Although, Luz quickly activates an [[Invisibility|Invisibility Glyph Spell]] to hide from two [[Coven Scout|Coven Scouts]].]

'''Coven Scout #1:''' Without that bird-tube, this place was wide open!

'''Coven Scout #2:''' I still haven't recovered from that tea party. [takes a sip from a giant jug of [[Apple Blood]]]

[Luz takes a gasp of breath once they're gone and the three walk into the Owl House. The place is deserted, Eda and Lilith are nowhere to be seen.

'''King:''' Do you think they were arrested?

[Luz finds a piece of paper on the ground that provides instructions on where they are. She activates a [[Light Glyph|light glyph]] so she can seen the writing better.]

'''Luz:''' No, they're hiding out on the knee!

[Transition over to the knee of the titan]

'''[[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]]:''' Using my old keys, we'll travel through the service tunnels. From there, we initiate the security system and everyone including Belos will be trapped inside the castle. Boom! [[Day of Unity]] stopped!

'''[[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]]:''' You don't think they changed the locks after you got booted from the [[Coven System|Coven]]?

'''Lilith:''' Well, at least I'm coming up with ideas.

'''Eda:''' Hey! I come up with some great ideas! [puts a bag of [[Hex Mix]] over her head.]

'''Lilith:''' Putting snores glue in the Emperor's shampoo bottle isn't going to save anyone's life!

[Lilith kicks a bag of [[Hex Mix]] on the ground.]

'''Lilith:''' This is just like you. You never take things seriously! At least Luz and King are far away from here.

'''Eda:''' Someone's tripped the booby trap.

[Lilith and Eda head over to the location of the trap and find Luz, King, and Hooty trapped inside it.]

'''Hooty:''' Hey, Lulu!

'''Luz:''' Hiiiiii.

[Everyone is gathered around a [[Fire Bee]] pit while Luz explains what happened.]

'''Luz:''' It took awhile to figure out which town you're in from your map. I had to keep off the streets with all those wanted posters, but that's when we saw your Hex Mix trail and well, you know the rest!

'''Eda:''' What map are you talking about? 

'''Luz:''' The one you left us, obviously.

'''Eda:''' Oh! [Stares directly at Lilith] The one we ''left'' them!

'''Lilith:''' Well, someone had to bury our bones!

'''Hooty:''' Lulu!! I got you a shirt! 

[He throws up an orange t-shirt on her lap that says "I was Sacrificed to the Grand Huntsman!", much to her and Eda's surprise.]

'''Lilith:''' I was sacrificed to the Grand Huntsman?

'''Eda:''' What the-?

'''Luz:''' So... turns out King's letter was sent by a bunch of Titan Trappers. And they may have tried to sacrifice King to the [[Collector]], who they worship.

'''Eda:''' Oh, so you found of a commune of [glares at Lilith] bloodthirsty fanatics in a place that was supposed to be empty!

'''Lilith:''' Well, they couldn't have been that scary without any Titans to trap!

'''Luz:''' Actually... [looks down at King.]

'''King:''' Mhm..

'''Luz:''' King... is a Titan.

'''King:''' Looks like I'm... due for a growth spurt soon... heh, heh.

[Lilith and Eda gasp in shock.]

[Scene transitions over to where King wraps a scarf around a snow bunny. King looks out into the scenery while Hooty wrapped around him.]

'''Eda:''' I can't believe that little guy is gonna turn into that big guy.

'''Luz:''' Certainly explains his strange new powers. He's just dealing with so much. I wish there was a way we could give him some comfort.

'''Lilith:''' I can't believe this! All this time you've had a Titan under your roof! [Gasps] I've eaten ice cream with a god!

'''Luz:''' Just because he has tall genes doesn't mean he's a god.

'''Eda:''' And he falls into the toilet like once a day.

'''Lilith:''' Perhaps he's still too young. His powers haven't... awakened yet. But who knows how he can help us against Belos!!

'''Eda:''' Don't worry Luz, we're not putting him in danger. He's a Clawthorne and technically your nephew, remember, dear sister?

'''Lilith:''' Right, of course. [Runs off] I'm a god's aunt! But is he a gentle god or an angry god?

'''Luz:''' So? Fill me in! How are we gonna defeat Belos and his draining spell?

'''Eda:''' Uh, right. Well... it's a secret!

[Luz pouts.]

'''Eda:''' Just for now. I'll fill you in closer to go time!

'''Luz:''' Ah, so if I'm captured I can't give anything away! Smart, thinkin', Owl Lady!

'''King:''' [Finishes building a snow bunny.] There! All done! Nice to meet you Fransnow... wha? [Arm of the snow bunny slips off.]

'''Luz:''' Aw, King, let me help with that. [Luz walks off and Lilith enters the area.]

'''Lilith:''' What are you doing?! Tell her!

'''Eda:''' Tell her what?! That we have no plan? That Belos is gonna win? That the [[Boiling Isles]] are doomed? [She sighs] The kids deserve one nice day before they realize how dire things are. [Luz makes an ice arm using an [[Ice Glyph|ice glyph.]]]

'''Lilith:''' [Shouting voice] And King deserves our praise! [Eda glares at her sister.]

'''Eda:''' Alright, kids! The uh... plan isn't gonna be ready till tomorrow, but if you could do anything if you could do anything in the world today, what would it be?

'''King:''' Thanks Eda, but I just want things to be normal right now.

'''Luz:''' Well, I wanna go on a heist!

'''Eda:''' Of course you do.

[There's a transition of scenes and now Lilith is walking over to King with a cup of tea.]

'''Lilith:''' King of... um, Titans, would you... like some tea?

'''King:''' Uh, no thanks. I'm... I'm good.

'''Lilith:''' Of course! Titans don't care for such lowly pleasures. [She throws the tea cup away.] 

'''Lilith:''' Perhaps I could offer you dark deeds carried out in your name. [Lilith pulls out a sword.] 

'''King:''' Uh, no. Listen, it's okay. I just uh need some alone time. Your Titan... commands it?  

[Lilith bows, her hair covering her entire face. She used her foot to hint for Hooty to bow as well. She grabs Hooty and walked away, her hair still in her face.]  

[King walks off.]  

[Scene transition to Eda and Luz riding on Eda's staff.] 

'''Luz:''' I saw scouts taking boxes from the house. They're probably holding everything at the Bonesborough Precinct, Francois included.  

'''Eda:''' Are you sure you wanna do this for a ''stuffed toy?''  Wouldn't you rather, oh I don't know, have a beach day?  

'''Luz:''' Maybe if we had time for 20 more adventures, but we don't. Besides, this is for King! He needs his buddy.    

[Luz and Eda land in between two buildings and watch mysterious cloaked people walk while holding candles.]    

'''Emperor's Coven Member #1:''' Ugh, I hate double-shifts. Can't wait for the day ''after'' the [[Day of Unity|Day of Unity.]] Know what I mean?

'''Emperor's Coven Member #2:''' Sure, but, I'm racking up OT like crazy!

'''Luz:''' [Gasps] There look! [She points at the building.] Francois! Let's pounce!

'''Eda:''' Hold up! If we're gonna do this we gotta do it right. Belos isn't taking any more chances with us after your little trip into his mind. If we wanna stay alive we have to be inconspicuous

[Scene changes where Eda and Luz make a flashy entrance inside the building, disguising themselves as Coven Scouts.]

'''Disguised Eda:''' Take me to my... I mean the [[Eda Clawthorne|Owl Lady's]] confiscated junk!

'''Disguised Luz:''' Nice save.    

[Scene changes to King sadly walking around [[Bonesborough]].]

'''[[Steve]]:''' Lose your way, little guy?

[King finds Steve sitting on some Boiling Isles-Version Motorcycle.]

'''King:''' Actually I got where I was going but now I, uh... eh?  Hey, I know you! You're [[Steve]] from [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith's]] party! Shouldn't you be like kissing the Emperor's butt right now?

'''[[Steve]]:''' Probably. Heck, growing up, all I wanted was to be an Emperor's Coven Scout, to be considered one of the best. I got what I wanted, but it's not what I thought it was.

'''King:''' I hear that.

'''Steve:''' Belos is supposed to know everything, but why should he know what the Titan wants? Maybe the Titan doesn't even know what he wants? Maybe he's just some normal guy, you know? [Sighs] Anyway, you going somewhere, cause I've got a sidecar and nothing but time!

[King hopes into the sidecar and Steve puts a helmet over his head.]

'''King:''' I point, you drive.

[Sidecar heads off.]

[Transition back to where Lilith is. While she is talking, Hooty eats a bunch of the [[Fire Bee|Fire Bees]] with his giant mouth.

'''Lilith:''' Did I insult him by groveling too much? Did I not grovel enough?

'''Hooty:''' Maybe he wants to be treated like, I don't know, normal?

'''Lilith:''' Nonsense! He's a Titan, for Titan's sake! [Gasps] Oh, Titan, I just took his name in vain. Ah! I did it again!

'''Hooty:''' Uh, Lulu, I think we have a bigger problem.

[King has gone missing.]

[Scene change back to the storage area.]

'''Disguised Luz:''' I would have appreciated ''some'' kind of reaction. These are hard to get.

'''Disguised Eda:''' Hey you, fellow guard! We just found a lot of illegal Hexis Holdem Cards. Can we get the key to the warehouse?

[Emperor's Coven member gives them the key.]

[Luz and Eda enter a Boiling Isles elevator by using the key.]

'''Disguised Eda:''' Why's everything going our way now?

'''Disguised Luz:''' Maybe our luck's finally turning!

[They enter the warehouse]

'''Disguised Eda:''' Woo, boy, we're gonna need to split up if we want to find Francois.

[The two take off their disguise helmets.]

'''Eda:''' If things get hairy, you fly out of here as fast as you can. Hey! Don't give me that face, just say okay, okay?

'''Luz:''' Okay.

'''Eda:''' Oh, and if you find a box labelled, "Eda's Longest Toenails", grab that, too.

'''Luz:''' [Chuckles] Ew.

[The two walk off in separate directions.]

'''Emperor's Coven member:''' We secured the Owl Lady's house that's correct, Head Witch.

'''Emperor's Coven Member:''' No, there was no sign of her.

'''[[Raine Whispers]]:''' Just keep looking until you find her and only come to me when you do.

'''Disguised Eda:''' Raine.

[Scene switches back over to Steve and King.]

[King and Steve travel all throughout the Boiling Isles, King coming to terms with who he is. The scene begins with Steve reading a book and King viewing what looks like to be a tooth of the Titan. While this is happening, Hooty and Lilith are right on their tails, trying to find King but always being one step behind.]

[Scene switches back to the warehouse.]

'''Emperor's Coven member:''' Head Witch, I'll do all I can to find the Owl Lady. You have my word.

'''Raine:''' Your word doesn't count much without results. Just go.

[Crystal Ball call ends and the Emperor's Coven member leaves.]

[Eda emerges from an [[Invisibility|Invisibility Glyph]] inside the room.]

[She reactivates the call with Raine.]

'''Raine:''' Captain, I thought I told you to--[gasps]--Eda?

'''Eda:''' Please just give me a minute, I'm not trying to stir trouble.

'''Raine:''' You're wearing a stolen uniform.

'''Eda:''' And I am working it! Listen, I don't know what you're hiding, but I do know that somewhere deep inside you still care about me, otherwise you wouldn't let me walk free at the [[Coven Day Parade|Coven Parade]]. Raine, I know about the [[Day of Unity]] and the [[Draining Spell|Draining Spell.]]

[Raine's emotion shifts.]

'''Eda:''' Nope, I, I saw that expression! It is that bad, isn't it? That's why I [Sighs], I need your help.

'''Raine:''' There's no time for your schemes, Eda.

'''Eda:''' Wait! This is for my kids. They can't be around during the Day of Unity. Put them in a castle, bunker, get them on an airship, I don't care! Just, just, keep them safe! If you do, I'll give myself up right now.

'''Raine:''' I- [Their sentence is interrupted by [[Terra Snapdragon]] when she enters the room.

'''[[Terra Snapdragon]]:''' Come along, sprout. Places to be, hedges to trim!

'''Disguised Eda:''' Awaiting further instructions, Head Witch.

'''Raine:''' Stay put. I'll send someone to receive the package.

'''Terra:''' Your uniform looks outdated, captain, looking like a pile of compost.

[Crystal Ball call ends.]

'''Luz:''' Eda? Are you sending me away?

[Eda is silent, not knowing what to say.]

'''Luz:''' You... you're sending me away??! But I can help! Why don't you get that yet?

[Coven Scout overhears conversation]

'''Luz:''' Call Raine back! Tell them there's no package to receive! I'm not going ANYWHERE until Belos is DEFEATED!

[Coven Scout runs off.]

'''Eda:''' No'''.'''

'''Luz:''' After everything we've been through, I can't believe you're still underestimating me! Fine! Let's just get back to King.

[Eda turns into Harpy Eda.]

'''Harpy Eda:''' You're going with Raine! They'll keep you safe!

'''Luz:''' You can't make me! [She holds up an [[Ice Glyph|Ice Glyph.]]]

'''Harpy Eda:''' Yes, I can.

[Luz places the glyph on the ground and activates it, triggering a bulk of ice that almost hits Eda in the eye.]

[Luz flies over some boxes with [[Owlbert]] to escape Eda.]

'''Harpy Eda:''' Owlbert! [Owlbert leaves his staff form, leading to Luz falling.]

[Eda almost has Luz until she grabs a [[Light Glyph]] and shines it in Eda's face, stopping her in her tracks.]

[Luz got away for a short amount of time with an [[Invisibility|Invisibility Glyph]], but Eda spots her again and stops her.]

'''Harpy Eda:''' Luz, please!

[Luz places down another [[Ice Glyph]] and uses it to make a sheet of ice where she slides directly under Eda.]

[Eda smashes the ice, leading to Luz falling again.]

'''Harpy Eda:''' Raine will be here soon. I'll have King join you afterwards.

'''Luz:''' But I can help with your plan!

'''Harpy Eda:''' It's time to go.

[Eda gets struck with a magic beam.]

'''Emperor's Coven Member:''' Hands up, Owl Lady!

[Eda rushes towards the scout] 

'''Luz:''' Eda! [Just as she said that, another scout trapped her in a magic net.]

[Eda tries to fight the [[Abomaton|Abomatons]], but she ends up getting trapped in a net, too.]

'''Emperor's Coven Member:''' Lock 'em up, and use the heavy duty stuff this time.

[Scene transition back to Steve and King.]

'''Steve:''' Hey, uh, your drink's gettin' warm.

'''King:''' You know, Steve, I always wanted to have power and command respect and fear! So, now that I kinda have all that, why does my stomach feel all... ugh?

'''Steve:''' Wants can change, so can people.

'''King:''' I don't want people to see me as a big scary monster anymore.

[Steve tasks off his Coven mask.]

'''Steve:''' Me neither.

'''Lilith:''' Unhand him, you Coven shill! 

[Lilith and Hooty find the two and are ready to attack, but Lilith recognizes Steve.

'''Lilith:''' Wait, Steve?

'''King:''' It's okay, it's okay! He's not a scout anymore! Did I read that right?

'''Steve:''' Mhm.

'''Lilith:''' Nevertheless. Let me shield you with my pitiful life, oh powerful-

'''King:''' Stop!! I'm still KING, KING! Isn't this how you acted with the Emperor? I'm sensing a little bit of a pattern with you.

'''Steve:''' Hey, girl, I've been there! I can recommend a good therapist!

'''Lilith:''' Hm...

'''Hooty:''' He's tricking you!! Attack plan activated!!

[Hooty slams directly into Steve.]

[Scene changes.]

[Eda and Luz get thrown in jail.]

'''Emperor's Coven Member:''' An envoy from the castle is coming to collect the human. The Owl Lady is to be taken to the [[Conformatorium]] for petrification, a real one this time.

'''Eda''': Why don't you just save yourself the trouble and put me down now.

'''Luz:''' You happy now? This way, neither of us can stop Belos. Why couldn't you just let me help with your stupid plan? Is it 'cause I'm a kid? Do you think I'm still that weak? Well?

'''Eda:''' It's because there IS no plan, okay?

[Luz gasps.]

'''Eda:''' Me and Lilith don't have magic and we don't have allies, we're useless. We have you and King. So, I wasn't gonna do anything to make sure that you were safe. But now, it's all over.

[Abomaton enters the room, putting them into transportation.]

'''Luz:''' Let go! Belos is a Witch Hunter! You, you have to listen! AH!

[She gets slammed inside the vehicle.]

'''Luz:''' Eda? Eda, can you hear me? I'll listen to you know, I'll do whatever you say, just fight back! Please! Eda!

[A little bit of a time jump.]

[The ride stops.]

[Luz kicks the door open and Abomination goo grabs her.

'''Luz:''' Argh! Where is she? Take me to Eda! If touch a single feather on her head... I'll, I'll!

'''Eda:''' Luz, Luz! It's okay.

'''[[Darius]]:''' I'm going to set you down, please don't try to bite anyone.

'''Luz:''' What's going on? Who are these people? 

[<nowiki/>[[Eberwolf]] uses their bestial teeth to bite apart Luz's handcuffs,]

'''King:''' Luz!

'''Luz:''' King'''!'''

'''Raine:''' So, you must be the famous human witch. Eda's been bragging about you for hours. I'm Raine.

'''Luz:''' Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm actually meeting you in person! I heard all about you adventures with Eda and how you became Head Witch of Bard Coven, where you're secretly a spy! And then you played that duet and then you got captured.

'''King:''' And your memories got all scramjambled.

'''Raine:''' Actually, when Darius captured me, he was really protecting me.

'''Darius:''' I thought I was the only one who found this Day of Unity junk suspicious. When I heard Raine was causing trouble, I had a feeling they'd know more. You would've been locked away if it weren't for me.

'''Raine:''' And a little less bruised! You could've let me in on things before attacking me!

'''Darius:''' You're a horrible actor! I had to make it look real!

'''Raine:''' Ugh, this is just like [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]].

'''Steve:''' Did you know of any of this stuff when you were in charge?

'''Lilith:''' I'm starting to think I wasn't very good at my job.

'''Eda:''' Raine, why didn't you tell me anything? I could've helped.

'''Raine:''' Is it so unbelievable that I wanted to keep you safe? But, in typical Eda fashion, you're not gonna stop until you make things right.

'''Eda:''' I guess not.

'''Lilith''': Things aren't hopeless! They have a plan to stop Belos and the Draining Spell!

'''Luz:''' [Gasps] Really? Wait, wait, before you get into that, please tell me you have a cool rebel name!

'''Raine:''' Actually, we do. Allow me to introduce...

'''Darius:''' Wait, hold on!

'''Raine:''' The Covens Against the Throne!

'''Darius:''' We talked about this, you promised!

'''Raine:''' A.K.A!

'''Darius:''' I did not agree to this name!

'''Raine:''' The CATS!

'''Luz:''' Everything's come full circle baby!

[Scene switches to the secret base of the CATS.]

[''The episode opens with an exterior shot of the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] with a buzzing and beeping noise from the inside. Cut to the inside of the Owl House.'']

[''[[Luz Noceda|Luz's]] phone is buzzing and charging. Luz grabs her phone while still sleeping with [[King|King]].'']

'''Luz''': ''(gasps)''

[''She sits up. Cut to a close-up shot of Luz's phone saying "Event Reminder With [[Camila Noceda|Mami]]". Luz stares at her phone, then ignores the event reminder.'']

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|MAIN THEME]]''']

[''Cut to the doorway to the living room, with [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] peeking on the corner with King on her head.'']

'''King''': Uh, feelin' okay, Luz?

'''Luz''': ''(Writing on a whiteboard)'' I feel great! Today's gonna be a productive day of problem solving. ''(She grabs a scroll of a list then shows it to Eda)'' Look!

'''Eda''': Successfully build a [[Portal|portal]] to the [[Human Realm|Human Realm]]? Learn every [[Magic|glyph]] combination? Figure out what [[Emperor Belos|Belos]] is planning and show him what for?

'''Luz''': Look. I've already learned a new combo. Excuse me, [[Francois|Francois]]. I call it the safety hover!

[''She grabs Francois from King and sticks a glyph combo into its chest. She then throws it in the air, and it floats right before it hit the ground.'']

'''King''': Ooh! That'll work great when birds try to fly away with me.

'''Luz''': And I'm already on my way to building a second door.

[''Cut to [[Hooty]] trying to stabilize a wooden door taped to him, with a broom, a cinderblock, and a hammer near it. Hooty then sneezes, causing everything to come crashing down.'']

'''Hooty''': Achoo! Ow.

'''Luz''': Uh, it's a work in progress. But look at this!

[''Luz grabs a [[Scroll]] out of her pocket.'']

'''Eda''': Did you steal my Penstagram?

'''Luz''': I borrowed it because I've got a [[Emperor's Castle|castle]] insider getting info on Belos. [[Willow Park|Willow]] gave me [[Hunter|Hunter's]] contact. Hehehe.

[''Luz starts texting Hunter with his username being RULERZREACHF4N'']

'''Luz''': ''(from text)'' Are you good now?

'''Luz''': ''(from text)'' Is Belos evil?? You can tell me!

'''Luz''': ''(from text)'' Also hi!

'''Luz''': ''(from text)'' It's Luz!

'''Luz''': ''(from text)'' ''(bat emoji, lighting emoji, flower emoji, plant emoji, and rainbow emoji.)''

'''Hunter''': ''(from text)'' LEAVE.ME ALONE

[''Hunter sends a picture of [[Flapjack]] sleeping on his robe.'']

'''Hunter''': ''(from text)'' sORry.wrong.person .,.

'''Eda''': Hmm. You're avoiding something. Spill it.

'''Luz''': I am not! Maybe I am. ''(lets Eda take her scroll back and sits)'' Okay, I definitely am. 

''(King and Eda surround her, Eda placing her old letterman jacket around Luz.)''

'''Luz''': Every year, me and Mom have this little ritual we do. It's nothing big. I just miss her. That's all.

'''King''': What you need is a healthy distractions from your problems. Like breakfast!

'''Luz''': Yeah. Okay. I could go for a [[Griffin|griffin]] egg.

'''Eda''': Well, let us know if you need anything, okay?

'''Luz''': I'll meet you guys in the kitchen.

[''Eda and King walk off.'']

'''Luz''': ''(sighs)''

[''[[Amity Blight|Amity]] walks in The Owl House'']

'''Amity''': Luz! I have a problem, and it could distract us all day!

'''Luz''': Tell me all about it and don't spare a single detail!

[''Cut to an exterior shot of the [[Blight Manor]]'']

'''Amity''': [[Alador Blight|Dad]], look! It's the [[Bonesborough Brawl]] tonight. And since I'm finally old enough to participate, I- I was thinking-

[''Alador grabs a book made by [[Darius]] titled "Abomination Creation" and looks at it with disgust.'']

'''Alador''': Ugh.

'''Amity''': Dad!

'''Alador''': Ah, Mittens! Didn't see you there. 

'''Amity''': Clearly. So do you think you'll be able to take me to the Brawl tonight?

'''Alador''': No. Uh, tonight they're holding the [[Emperor's Coven]] tryouts in town. Your [[Odalia Blight|mother]] already signed you up, and I've prepared a chaperone to make sure you get there safely.

[''Alador throws the book to the [[Abomaton]], then the Abomaton slices the book in half and picks Amity up.'']

'''Amity''': Aah!

[''An alarm from the Abomaton sets off, then Alador turns it off with a remote.'']

'''Amity''': You mean to make sure I get there. Dad... I don't want to go to coven tryouts. I wanna enter the Brawl, and maybe win the champion belt. Like you did.

'''Alador''': I goofed off a lot back then. But you have a bright future and shouldn't waste it on that nonsense.

'''Amity''': Uh, but-

'''Alador''': You're welcome.

[''The Abomaton walks off while holding Amity.'']

[''Cut to The Owl House.'']

'''Amity''': I don't even want to join a coven anymore. And this thing is so embarrassing, I even tried disguising it.

'''Luz''': Yeah. I actually think Eda has the same outfit.

[''Luz stares at the Abomaton's outfit and touches it.'']

'''Amity''': The Bonesborough Brawl is the one cool thing my dad did before joining the [[Coven System|Abomination coven]]. It would've been nice to share something with him.

[''Cut to a close-up shot of a picture Amity is holding. It's a picture of her dad as a teenager holding the brawler's belt. Below the stage, some of the people among the audience include: Warden Wrath, Odalia, and Darius, who is booing. Eda and [[Raine Whispers|Raine]] are in the background goofing off together.'']

'''Luz''': Well, hey, I'm here to help... you ditch the tryouts and enter the Brawl!

'''Amity''': What?!

'''Luz''': Come on. You should know I always go for the chaotic route.

[''Luz winks at Amity. Amity blushes.'']

'''Luz''': And if you win, maybe you can use it as a chance to tell your dad that you don't want to join a coven anymore.

[''Eda and King appear at the doorway to the living room.'']

'''Eda''': Did somebody say Bonesborough Brawl? I used to love going to those. Your pops was great in duels. Plus, if you go, you can get that ugly thing out of my house.

'''Amity''': Hmm. You know what? I'll give it a shot.

[''Amity circles a spell to make her voice change into her dad's voice,'']

'''Amity''': ''(in Alador's voice)'' Abomination, fetch me, a, uh, rare and- and difficult to find emerald dagger from the [[Night Market]]!

[''The Abomaton leaves The Owl House.'']

'''Eda''': That'll keep him busy.

'''Amity''': But my dad can't find out that I ditched tryouts. Not until I win that belt.

'''Luz''': Don't worry. I got you, boo.

[''Cut to the forest. [[Edric Blight|Edric]] and [[Emira Blight|Emira]] appear.'']

'''Edric and Emira''': Hey, Mittens!

[''Amity is annoyed, and Luz tries to calm her down.'']

'''Emira''': We're proud of you, sis.

'''Edric''': Yeah, you're becoming more of a delinquent every day.

'''Emira:''' All right, Ed. Hand over your [[Concealment Stone]].

'''Edric''': Like I need one of those.

[''Emira grabs Edric and pulls him over.'']

'''Edric''': Hey!

'''Emira''': Don't play games, Ed. I saw you take one this morning.

'''Edric''': Well you saw wrong!

'''Amity''': ''(to Luz)'' This won't take long.

[''Edric and Emira are fighting to get Edric's concealment stone.'']

'''Edric''': Wait.. What's that supposed to mean?

[''Emira rolls Edric's sleeve, finding his concealment stone on his wrist.'']

'''Emira''': Found it!

[''Emira takes Edric's consealment stone, then Edric's look suddenly changes. He's wearing a t-shirt, sweatpants, glasses, with his hair pulled back with a headband, and his little uneven moustache growing out.'']

'''Edric''': ''(grunts)''

'''Emira''': Here's mine too for a little extra flair.

[''Emira takes off her concealment stone, then her look also changed. Her face is covered in acne growing out, her beauty mark is gone and her hair is messy.'']

[''Amity grabs the stones and starts to combine them together. Her whole looks suddenly changed within a poof too. She's wearing an abomination-themed dress, boots, with golden earrings and pink shades, and her hair is tied up in a bun.'']

'''Amity''': Not bad.

[''Luz runs over to Amity then starts to hug and spin her around.'']

'''Luz''': Ooh, so pretty!

[''Luz and Amity blush. Both Amity and Emira giggle.'']

[''Cut to Eda and King watching Luz, Amity, Emira, and Edric.'']

'''King''': Hey, Eda!

[''Cut to a close-up shot of [[Warden Wrath]] fixing his Champ belt.'']

'''King''': Maybe we can find out what Belos is planning.

'''Eda''': And why Raine was acting weird at the [[Coven Day Parade|parade]].

[''King hides in Eda's hair. Eda walks over to Wrath to have a talk with him.'']

'''Eda''': Boo!

'''Wrath''': Oh, it's you.

'''King''': ''(pops out of Eda's hair)'' And me!

'''Eda''': Been training since my student humiliated you in battle? Hmm. Twice?

[''Wrath is about to attack Eda.'']

'''Eda''': All right. Chill out, button eyes. Just answer me this: Heard any good castle gossip lately? Maybe something about the [[Day of Unity]]?

'''Wrath''': ''(chuckles)'' I see. So you finally need something from me, don't you, Owl Lady? But why should I help you?

[''Eda grabs Wrath.'']

'''Wrath''': Oh!

'''Eda''': After chopping off my head...

'''King''': Stealing my crown...

'''Eda''': ...and imprisoning my student/child, I think you owe me.''

[''Eda's arm turns into her harpy beast mode threatening Wrath. Wrath snaps his finger, then a couple of security appears.'']

'''Security''': Sorry, Owl Lady. No fighting outside the ring.

'''Eda''': Okay, okay. Watch the goods.

'''King''': Whoa, you gave up pretty easy.

'''Eda''': Don't worry, King.

[''Eda grabs a Potions Book from her hair and opens a page with the recipe to make Blabber Serum.'']

'''Eda''': I have a plan.

'''Announcer''': Witches and demons, welcome to the Bonesborough Brawl!

[''Audience cheers.'']

'''Announcer''': You know the rules. Contestants will fight one-on-one. Not for honor, not for glory, but for the ultimate bragging rights as the toughest dueler on the [[Boiling Isles|Isles]]!

[''Audience cheers.'']

'''Announcer''': Last one standing will get the chance to snag the coveted Brawler's Belt from our reigning champion, Warden Wrath!

[''Wrath gets on the arena, and starts flexing his belt.'']

'''Announcer''': For our first round, we have Scab the All-Knowing...

[''Scab the All-Knowing gets to the arena.'']

'''Announcer''': ...versus The Mighty Mittens!

[''Amity gets to the arena by riding an abomination to the arena.'']

[''Amity waves at Luz, Edric, and Emira. They waved back at her, and Luz starts blowing Amity kisses.'']

'''Announcer''': Now let the brawl begin!

[''Scab jumps and takes off. They then starts to blast a ray from their orb to Amity. Amity blocks it by using her abomination.'']

[''Amity transforms her abomination then launched it behind Scab and punched them from behind.'']

[''Cut to Luz closing her eyes to not see Amity's abomination punching Scab.'']

'''Luz''': ''(inner-dialogue)'' Wow! Amity's got this in the bag. Guess I, uh, don't need to do much. I can just sit back and think about things.

[''Luz's phone starts ringing again, reminding her about the event. Edric and Emira emerges from Luz's back'']

'''Emira''': Hey, Luz.

'''Edric''': Ooh, what's that?

[''Luz stares at her phone for a while, then ignores the event reminder again.'']

'''Emira''': You okay?

'''Luz''': Yeah! Uh, yeah, I'm fine. 'Cause I just remembered the other part of the plan. Amity's gonna kick butt, like, for sure, but if I was fighting, too, she could get the belt faster. So, I'm also gonna sign up for the Bonesborough Brawl!

[''In the background, Scab gets thrown with Amity's abomination and crashes.'']

[''Cut to the woods near the arena, where the Blights watch Luz stretch.'']

'''Amity''': Wait, how is this supposed to help me?

'''Luz''': Think of it like, tag teaming tournament! If I'm taking out contestants too, you have less people to worry about. More chances to win that belt!

'''Amity''': Is everything okay? Eda told me it's a special day for you.

'''Luz''': She did? I mean, i- it's nothing for you to worry about. Not even worth talking about. Really, I- I just wanna help you. Besides, can't let you have all the fun, Blight.

[''Amity blushes.'']

'''Amity''': Just don't get hurt, okay?

'''Luz''': Emira, do you know any healing spells?

'''Emira''': I'm on it.

'''Edric''': Ooh, I can help too. I can make [[Batric]] sing for moral support.

[''Edric circles in the air to make a spell, but fails.'']

'''Edric''': Ah, sorry. New spell. Let me try again.

[''Edric circles in the air, and fails again.'']

'''Emira''': It's okay, Ed. Maybe you can just cheer from the sidelines?

'''Edric''': Yeah, okay. Go get 'em, Mittens!

[''Emira, Amity, and Luz walks away. Edric slumps sadly and walks into the forest.'']

'''Edric''': Man, I can't get anything right.

[''Edric and Batric notices something on the ground. Batric chirps then flies away. It's revealed to be goreberries. Edric walks over, and tries to touch it, but a voice from the rustling bushes interrupts him.'']

'''King''': Hey, sweatpants! Scram! [''He and Eda burst out of the bush'']

'''Eda''': You'll scare away the Skin Badgers! We need their dandruff.

'''Edric''': Oh! I thought Skin Badgers ate shushrooms, not goreberries. Also, they're strong, so you'll need a fortified rope. [''He traces a spell circle in the air, then touches the rope, which turns gold. King and Eda look at each other as Edric stands up''] Sorry. I'm probably messing stuff up. Just forget I said anything.

[''Edric starts to walk away but Eda calls out to him.'']

'''Eda''': Wait! You know beast keeping magic?

'''Edric''': A little. It's just a hobby though. Probably not anything good. [''walks away'']

[''Eda and King look stunned, then smile at each other; Eda runs after Edric.'']

'''Eda''': Hey! Blight Brother!

'''Edric''': [''stops walking''] Edric.

'''Eda''': Nah. Too close to Eda. Here's the deal. [''King arrives and hops onto Eda's shoulder''] I'm trying to make a blabber serum. I need to get certain information out of a certain demon. But, without magic, I'm having trouble getting some of these more lively ingredients. Your beast keeping know-how could really help.

'''Edric''': You think I could help? [''looks down and frowns, but stops and smiles''] Okay, I'll do it!

'''Eda''': Dang! I didn't even have to offer to pay.

'''Edric''': Wait what?

'''Eda''': [''pulls Edric away''] Let's get started!

[''Back to the Bonesborough Brawl.'']

'''Announcer''': Let's keep the brawl going! In one corner, [''points to the right''] we have... the Flexicutioner! [''The Flexicutioner arrives with a loud thud''] And in the other, a last minute entry... 

[''An ice pillar grows, launching Luz from it. She then flips in the air and uses a plant glyph to grow vines that wrap around her and shield her from falling, which meets the floor with a loud thud. The vines unwrap around Luz as she raises her arms as if achieving victory.'']

'''Announcer''': ...the Spellraiser! 

[''Below the stage, Amity is shocked and blushes while Emira cheers for Luz. Luz and the Flexicutioner approach the middle.''] 

'''Announcer:''' Let the brawl... begin!

[''The Flexicutioner speeds off, leaving a gap from where he just stood, and launches towards Luz, preparing to attack her with his axe, but Luz dodges. She continues to escape his attacks until the Flexicutioner hits the ground with his axe, blowing Luz away who is about to fall, but slows her falling when she grabs a glyph from her pockets and slaps it on herself, which slows her landing once she is in near contact with the ground, and falls down. The Flexicutioner once more prepares to attack her with his axe, but Luz taps an invisibility glyph in her hand, making her go invisible and confusing the Flexicutioner. Unbeknownst to him, Luz reappears behind him. She then slaps a fire glyph on his back, which sends him ricocheting off the arena. The announcer then comes over and raises Luz's hand, declaring that she has won the match.'']

[''Cut to a skin badger noticing a flower nearby and runs up to chew on it. The flower then transforms into a cover and traps it inside. Eda plucks off a hair from atop the skin badger's head and crosses off "SKIN BADGER HAIR" from the list.'']

[''Meanwhile, back at the venue, Amity faces against the Book Forger from "[[Sense and Insensitivity]]". They rush towards each other and attempts to push each other back, creating a power force so strong which causes both of them to fly backwards. The book forger summons a large rock from the ground and launches it at Amity. She immediately forms a shield with abomination which successfully blocks the incoming stone, but the force of impact is still strong enough to send her flying backwards. She hits the ground and rolls over multiple times, but eventually manages to sit up. She then summons some Abomination goo, wraps it around the book forger's foot, and throws him off the stage. Below the stage, Emira is busy trying to cure an injury on Luz's knee with Healing magic. The book forger smashes into a pile of dirt next to them and then falls face down onto the ground. The audience cheers.'']

[''Cut to Batric walking sideways on the ground when it hears something and looks up. Somewhere above, a [[Fairy]] notices Batric and rushes towards it. However, Batric turns out to be an illusion. Two ropes then appear and ties up the Fairy, causing her to fall to the ground. She starts crying and screeching. Eda crosses off "FAIRY SPIT" off her list.'']

[''Back at the venue, Luz finds herself facing down an old goat demon. The demon smashes her walking cane into her knee, splitting it in half. She then starts shrieking, forming a battle aura around her. Luz immediately takes out 2 smoke glyphs from her pocket and smashes them together, creating a large amount of mist. She then escorts the demon out of the mist. The demon pushes her away and tries to walk off on her own, but accidentally falls down the stage instead. The announcer comes, grabs Luz's arm and lifts it up, declaring her the winner. The audience cheers.'']

[''Cut to some purple liquid boiling in a pot. Scene changes again to show Edric, Eda and King sitting around the pot, with Eda stirring it with a spatula. The pot is heated up with fire.'']

'''Edric:''' So the Blabber Serum should get your ex to tell you about your other ex? Man, being an adult gets complicated.

'''Eda:''' [''angrily''] WARDEN WRATH IS NOT MY- [''exasperated''] King, can you stop telling people that?

[''King laughs.'']

'''Eda:''' Wrath may know why my... friend can't seem to remember me. And it has something to do with the Day of Unity. But, with this, he'll tell me everything I need to know. 

[''Eda stares at her reflection on the serum and smirks.'']

'''Eda:''' Dang. [''stands up''] The fire needs to be hotter. Keep stirring while I find more fuel.

'''Edric:''' [''salutes''] Ma'am!

[''Eda passes over the spatula to Edric and walks away. Edric then sits next to King.'']

'''King:''' You're enjoying this, aren't you, Blight brother?

'''Edric:''' It's just... nice to be taken seriously for once.

'''King:''' Yeah. I know what you mean.

[''King climbs up Edric's shoulder and watches him stirring the pot.'']

[''Back at the brawl venue, on stage, Warden Wrath is tossing a contestant in between his hands while laughing. Below the stage, Luz is doing some warm-ups while Emira is trying to cure a wound on Amity's knee with Healing magic.'']

'''Luz:''' Woo! This is a workout! You doin' okay, Amity?

[''Luz walks up to the duo and stares down at Amity's wound.'']

'''Amity:''' Yeah. [''clenches teeth''] This is just a nasty one.

'''Luz:''' Ha! Reminds me of the [[Grudgby]] match. [''suddenly pushes Emira forward''] Oh! Remember when-

'''Emira:''' Hey, Luz! Maybe you can talk after? I need to focus.

'''Luz:''' [''steps back''] Oh! Of course, of course. I'll just... [''kneels down''] sit quietly... with my thoughts.

'''Luz (inner monologue):''' I just need a healthy distraction. Healthy distraction...

[''Luz's phone starts buzzing and ringing again, which startles her, sending her into panic mode.'']

'''Luz:''' [''stands up''] I'm gonna go take a walk.

[''Luz walks away from the duo. Amity stares at her with a perplexed expression on her face. Scene cuts to Luz walking towards the entrance. She takes out her phone from her pocket and turns off the reminder.'']

'''Luz:''' Next time, I am THROWING YOU into the ocean!

[''Luz puts her phone back into her pocket and accidentally bumps into something. She steps back and notices that it's the Abomaton Amity sent out earlier.'']

'''Luz:''' It's you! Geez. Did you actually find an emerald dagger?

[''The Abomaton walks forward, going past Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey! Wait! Amity is so close to winning. Just stay back!

[''While talking, Luz runs up to the front of the Abomaton and tries to hold it back, but it keeps advancing forward, which frustrates Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Fine! If that's the way you want it...

[''Luz takes out an Ice Glyph and slaps on it, taking out an ice bat.'']

'''Luz:''' Hi-yah! 

[''Luz swings the bat at the Abomaton's head and hits it. It wobbles and then restores itself. A warning light bulb pops up from atop the Abomaton's head and flashes, along with the sound of an alarm going off. Luz gasps.'']

'''Luz:''' [''screams and covers her ears''] Get out of MY HEAD!!!

[''Luz slams a Plant Glyph into the ground, creating a wood stump below her which pushes her upwards. She then jumps off it and swings at the bulb, breaking it and knocking it onto the ground. After landing, Luz looks up at the Abomaton with a horrified expression.'']

'''Emira:''' Luz!

[''Luz looks back and notices Amity and Emira running up to her. She immediately throws the ice bat aside and turns towards the duo.'']

'''Emira:''' Is everything okay?

'''Luz:''' Hey, guys! Look who I found!

'''Amity:''' Ugh. It's back already! You didn't touch it, right? Dad filled this thing with alarms.

'''Luz:''' Uh, of... course not.

[''Luz and Amity hear growling and look towards it. On the stage, Warden Wrath begins spouting fire. The audience cheers.'']

'''Luz:''' [''grabs Amity's hand''] Come on, Amity. It's showtime!

[''Cut to later on stage.'']

'''Announcer:''' Now, we're getting close to the end, folks! Will the Warden lose the Champion's Belt?

[''Warden Wrath takes off his mask and begins to spout fire while growling. He then tilts his head upwards and spouts an even bigger fire while growling. The audience cheers. Luz's taps on Amity's shoulder to get her attention, and imitates Warden Wrath's growl in a funny way, causing Amity to burst out giggling. Luz then giggles together with her. After that, the duo gets ready to fight, with Luz patting Amity on the shoulders.'']

'''Announcer:''' The Mighty Mittens versus the Warden! Now, let the brawl-

[''The ground suddenly shakes, causing the announcer to glance down in shock. Luz almost falls, but manages to grab onto Amity's arm.'']

'''Alador:''' Stop!

[''Alador emerges from the ground wrapped in a layer of Abomination goo.'']

'''Alador:''' This child ''forfeits'' the match.

[''Everyone else is shocked.'']

'''Amity:''' Dad? How did you find us?

[''Alador's abomination starts to lower him on the ground and is eventually scooped back into a container attached to his back.'']

'''Alador:''' Not only did you ditch the coven tryouts, but someone set off your Abomaton's alarm. I just followed its signal. [''hands her the broken alarm'']

[''Amity stares at the alarm in shock while Luz nervously looks away.'']

'''Amity:''' [''feeling betrayed''] Luz, did you... ''lie'' to me earlier?

'''Luz:''' [''nervously''] I didn't wanna worry you.

'''Amity:''' Well, I am worried! You've been acting weird all day and now I'm in trouble! What is going on with you?

'''Luz:''' It's nothing, really. Seriously, it- it's nothing! 

[''Amity is saddened by Luz's refusal to open up and her face turns sorrowful.'']

'''Warden Wrath:''' Hey! 

[''Alador, Amity and Luz look towards him.'']

'''Warden Wrath:''' I'm tired of standing around. I came here to FIGHT! [''launches himself with his hands which have turned into tentacles'']

[''Before he could attack, he is countered by abomination goo summoned by Alador, which eventually encases his body except his face.'']

'''Warden Wrath:''' No! No! [''breathes fire, but stops when Alador's abomination goo whisks him to the floor'']

'''Announcer:''' Oh, well, it looks like the Champion's Belt goes to... [''gets Warden's champion belt and prepares to hand it to Alador'']

'''Alador:''' [''turns around and walks away''] I already have one. [''to Amity''] Mittens, go round up Edric and Emira. We're leaving.

'''Amity:''' But-

'''Alador:''' [''serious''] And if we beg, maybe we can sign you up for the next tryout.

[''Alador attempts to take Amity's hand but she slaps it away angrily.'']

'''Amity:''' No! I'm not going anywhere with you. [''summons an invisibility glyph from Luz's pocket''] Either of you. [''inhales and runs away vanishing'']

'''Luz;''' Amity! [''runs after her, leaving Alador'']

[''Behind Alador, King and Edric peek out from a tree in the distance.'']

'''King:''' Aw, weak. Your dad's here.

'''Edric:''' But look! Wrath's tied up. This is the perfect chance to give him the serum!

'''King;''' But it isn't ready! [''Edric leaves''] Hey!

[B''ack to their camping spot, Edric unties a sack and scrambles through the things inside.'']

'''Edric:''' No, not this one. Oh! [''pulls out a jar of fire bee honey and runs to the cauldron'']

'''King:''' What are you doing?

'''Edric:''' [''opens the jar lid''] If the Blabber Serum needs more heat to finish, then this should do just the trick. [''pours a drop of fire bee honey into the cauldron'']

[''The potion emits a flash of light and it turns green and bubbly.'']

'''Edric:''' You find Ms. Eda. I'll head over to Wrath. [''King nods and runs off; Edric carries the cauldron with a spell'']

[''Meanwhile, Luz tries to find Amity with no luck, only to discover her glasses lying near her feet. She walks over as the background changes to [[Enchanting Grom Fright|the tree she and Amity grew at Grom together]]. Upon seeing Amity, she walks closer.'']

'''Luz:''' Can I, uh, sit here? 

[''Amity merely nods, and she sits down beside her.'']

'''Amity:''' I've always wanted to enter this Brawl. I thought it would be fun to bring home the belt. And I thought I could understand my dad better. But then you joined the competition. And then you tried to mess with that Abomaton on your own. And then you lied about it. 

[''Luz looks away guiltily.''] 

'''Amity:''' You've been acting strange all day. Does it have something to do with the Human Realm?

'''Luz:''' Oh, okay, okay. I don't talk about this cause it happened like, a long time ago, and it's like totally not an issue anymore but uh... 

[''Luz hands her phone to Amity, who presses the reminder she had been avoiding all day. It says "Anniversary at [[Gravesfield]] Graveyard. When: 5:00."''] 

'''Luz:''' Today's the anniversary of my dad passing away. That's, not an excuse for what I did. Like I said it happened a while ago so I, uh... 

[''Amity looks at her in shock.''] 

'''Luz:''' ...Didn't want to bring it up. 

[''Amity scrolls through the photos Luz has with her parents, eventually the later ones with only her and her mom when she was younger.''] 

'''Luz:''' He always brought us flowers on our birthdays, so, after he passed away, we started picking flowers for each other. And then we'd visit his grave, and me and my mom would spend the day together. It's nice. But, this year, I-I'm not with her, and... I don't have any flowers. And when you told me about the problem with your dad, I don't know. [''starts to tear up''] Maybe I was jealous or, just, needed a distraction. [''she bows her head''] I was dumb. I'm sorry.

[''Amity is about to console Luz when they both heard sounds of people screaming. They look towards the source of sound and gasp. Amity immediately takes off, but Luz collapses after standing and her legs are wobbly; Amity looks back at her.'']

'''Luz:''' [''chuckles''] Whoops, got a case of the ole jelly legs. I'll catch up.

[''Amity looks towards the noise and back at Luz.'']

'''Amity:''' [''blushing''] I don't know what rituals you have in the Human Realm, but, I'll help you pick some flowers, and we can do something here! 

[''Amity leaves as Luz looks at her, also blushing.'']

[''Back in the arena, a woman screams as she points to something offscreen as she and other people run away; Eda arrives with King on her shoulder'']

'''Eda:''' What the heck happened?

'''Edric:''' I-I added fire bee honey to the blabber serum!

'''Eda:''' You changed the recipe? [''pulls Edric away as Wrath, now a roaring monster, causes chaos in the arena'']

[''Eda unleashes her harpy form and roars at Wrath.'']

'''Harpy Eda:''' [''flies over Wrath''] Hey, Wrath! You still in there, buddy? [''she attacks him but he blows her away into the forest'']

[''Just then, an Abomaton gets hold of Wrath, revealed to be controlled by Alador; the Abomaton is knocked away as Alador summons another abomination'']

'''Emira:''' [''runs over''] Edric! [''Amity arrives'']

'''Amity:''' Dad! I got your back! What?

[''She attempts to summon an abomination but Alador instead brings her to Edric, Emira and King who are displeased for taking Amity away.'']

'''Emira:''' What the heck, Dad!

'''Edric:''' Boo! [''Alador continues to hold off Wrath.'']

'''Amity:''' [''stands up angrily''] Oh, he just doesn't get it! [''Harpy Eda lands nearby.''] Are you guys doing okay?

'''Harpy Eda:''' For now, but nothing phases this guy, and we have to turn him back to normal.

'''Edric:''' [''stands up''] Well, if the heat from the fire bee honey caused the potion to mutate, then maybe something cold would reverse it?

'''Harpy Eda:''' We don't have time for a new potion!

'''Luz:''' [''offscreen''] You don't need one. [''everyone looks at her; Amity gasps''] I can handle this. Eda, can you give me a lift?

'''Harpy Eda:''' You got it, kiddo. [''flies off'']

'''Luz:''' [''walks over to Amity''] Thank you for listening. [''holds Amity's hand''] I can't wait to pick flowers with you. [''she walks back and fans some glyphs in her hand, and her other hand gets caught by Harpy Eda'']

[''Alador, meanwhile, is having trouble controlling the Abomaton, which is cruelly being smashed by the monster Wrath. The Abomaton gets thrown off and is smashed by Wrath's jelly hand. Just then, another abomination appears and helps the Abomaton, to Alador's shock, the abomination is revealed to have been summoned by Amity. Alador once again prepares to send her off, but she stops him.'']

'''Amity:''' I'm making my own choices from now on.

'''Alador:''' But-

'''Amity:''' You're welcome. [''divides her spell circle into two'']

'''Edric:''' Hold him down! 

[''Both Alador and Amity nod to each other, then dispel their circles and create another larger one, combining their abominations, which hold Wrath in place. Alador looks at Amity, still focused, and he looks back proudly. Harpy Eda and Luz arrive; Luz throws the glyphs in mid-air as Harpy Eda turns around and they both activate the glyphs, creating large amounts of snow that encase Wrath as the Blights' abomination release him. Everyone comes back to where Alador and Amity are.''] 

'''Alador:''' Edalyn.

'''Harpy Eda:''' Alador.

'''Alador:''' [''eyeing Harpy Eda''] Were you always able to do that? [''Harpy Eda turns back into her normal form in a puff of smoke'']

'''Eda:''' Don't you have family stuff to clear up? Also, I heard about [[Escaping Expulsion|the factory incident with Luz]]. I've got my eyes on you, Blight. [''slowly walks away raising two fingers and pulls Wrath out of the snow''] What's going on at the castle? What's really gonna happen on the [[Day of Unity]]? Have Raine's memories been altered?

'''Warden Wrath:''' I don't know! I don't know. I actually got demoted for stealing my coworker's lunches. I just wanted to feel in control again, you know? [''Eda growls angrily and her arm turns into a claw''] Okay, okay, okay. I don't know about Raine but I have heard some things. The Day of Unity is supposedly going to unite us with the Titan, but some of us don't think this "new world" would be very inviting to magickind. [''Eda's claw arm turns back to normal''] Wild or not. [''Eda pushes him back into the snow.'']

'''Eda:''' Hmm..

'''Edric:''' [''runs over''] Ms. Eda! I am so, so sorry. I messed everything up.

'''Eda:''' Are you kidding? Instead of making a blabber serum, you made a horrifying transformation serum! [''she scrapes some snow off to reveal Wrath'']

'''Warden Wrath:''' I think I'm gonna puke! [''proceeds to puke'']

'''Eda:''' Well, the side effects aren't pretty, but I can sell this. [''gets something from her hair''] Illusions, beastkeeping, and potion magic? [''King crawls up to Eda's shoulder''] Keep it up, kid. You got a future in wild magic. 

[''Eda throws Edric a "Bad Girl Coven" t-shirt.'']

'''Edric:''' Thanks, Ms.--

'''Emira:''' [''runs in front of Edric''] I want a t-shirt too!

[''Scene slowly pans to Alador and Amity.'']

'''Alador:''' What? You don't want to join the [[Emperor's Coven]] anymore? But that's- that's always been your dream.

'''Amity:''' No, that's always been Mom's dream. And you just went along with it. [''starts to blush''] I bet you didn't even know I was dating Luz!

'''Alador:''' Edalyn's kid?

'''Amity:''' See? You don't talk to us anymore! You're too busy making these monsters for [[Emperor Belos|the Emperor]], and Mom's been too busy trying to dye my hair green.

'''Alador:''' I.. I like your new hair color. It's abomination-colored.

'''Amity:''' Finally someone gets it. Can you tell Mom that?

'''Alador:''' I'll talk to her. [''he tries to reach out for a hug but Amity instead shakes his hand'']

'''Amity:''' It's a start.

[''Back at the Grom tree, Amity walks over to find Luz on a cliff picking flowers, most of which are dead. She sits next to her.'']

'''Amity:''' Find any good ones?

'''Luz:''' No, not really.

'''Amity:''' Let me try. 

[''She tries to draw a plant glyph on the soil, but when she activates it, all that comes out is an ugly vine.'']

'''Amity:''' [''offscreen''] Ugh. [''cont.''] How do you get it to do what you want?

'''Luz:''' You gotta know what you need. [''starts drawing a plant glyph on the soil''] I can't believe I didn't try this first. My head's really on backwards today. 

[''Her glyph is more well-drawn and upon activating it, pretty flowers spring from it. She picks them and turns to Amity.'']

'''Luz:''' Now what? 

[''Amity summons abomination goo from the jar in her pocket, and it morphs into a balloon, which she hands to Luz. Luz ties the flowers to the balloon and after closing her eyes for a while, she lets it float away.'']

'''Amity:''' Do you think they'll reach the Human Realm?

'''Luz:''' Probably doesn't work that way, but... it's a nice thought, right? 

[''Luz and Amity hold hands as petals flow across them and away with the balloon.'']

[''Back in the [[Human Realm]], at the [[Noceda residence]], [[Camila Noceda|Camila]] somberly places a flower in the vase that's on a windowsill. [[Vee]] can be seen behind her, mixing something. As Camila looks up at the sky, she sniffs sadly. Then, she smiles faintly and walks away.'']

''[Open on Luz holding a ball of light in one hand and carrying the [[Owl Staff]] in the other through a cave. She stops when she sees a large shadow on the wall in front of her.'']

'''Garlog:''' [''laughs'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps'']

'''Garlog:''' Foolish child. Leave this place before you meet your demise.

'''Luz:''' Do not underestimate me, Garlog. For I am the good witch, Luz, hunter of monsters. [''Perches the staff on her shoulder like a bazooka''] Now eat this sucka-- what?

[''Garlog torns out to be a tiny creature casting a shadow standing in front of a lantern. Luz picks him up and he lets out a squeak trying to escape.'']

'''Luz:''' You're Garlog? [''pulls out his wanted poster, depicting him as being much larger and worth 4,000 snails, compares it to the real thing''] This is pathetic.

'''Garlog:''' Small I may be, but you will soon know fear when I lay waste to all that you-

[''He gets cut off by King, who eats him whole.'']

'''Luz:''' King, drop it now. Drop it now!

'''King:''' [''mumbles, runs off'']

'''Luz:''' [''chases after him''] Drop it! No! I'm not gonna play right now! King!

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-'''

[''The Owl House is shown, wind howling. Cut to Luz's room, where Garlog is stuffed in a bottle while Luz sets her phone against it.'']

'''Luz:''' [''boops Garlog's nose''] Boop! [''turns on camera to say hello to [[Camila Noceda|her mother]], just like the end of the season finale''] Hola, Mama! You haven't heard from me in a while. It's been [[Young Blood, Old Souls|a week and a half since the petrification ceremony. A week and a half since I destroyed the portal home. I had to. Emperor Belos was going to kill Eda if I didn't hand it over. But I couldn't let him use it, so I blew it up with some magic fire]]... She's not gonna understand any of this. That's okay, Luz. Just keep moving forward. This world is filled with inexplicable magical wonders, like this portal key! I don't know if it contains magic, but I'm gonna study all I can, and find a way back to you. A-And look! [''Lifts up her leg to show King holding onto it''] I have friends to help me.

'''King:''' I'm never letting you go! You're never returning to the human realm!

'''Luz:''' He doesn't mean that. [''covers camera'']

'''King:''' Yes I do!

[''Cut to [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] in the kitchen, where she is trying to cast magic.'']

'''Luz:''' [''narrating''] This is Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. [[Agony of a Witch|Or at least she was until her curse overpowered her and weakened her magic]]. She's doing her best now.  

[''Scene switches to [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]], who is wearing a new outfit and putting her old one away.'']  

'''Luz:''' [''narrating''] Eda was cursed by her own sister, Lilith. And she spent her entire life looking for a way to undo it. It's still hard for everyone to trust each other, but maybe with time we can all become friends.

[''Lilith stares out of the open window pensively, a small smile appearing on her face as Luz narrates. She jumps when Hooty appears in the window.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hello!

'''Lilith:''' [''screams, slams the window in Hooty's face'']

[''Cut to outside the Owl House. Eda is seen constructing something.'']

'''Luz:''' [''narrating''] Even though Eda gets frustrated, she's found new ways to make up for her lost powers.

'''Eda:''' Check it, Luz! A new hunting weapon. I will call her the Stab-Catcher.

'''Luz:''' [''narrating''] Without the portal, Eda has no human garbage to sell. So, we've resorted to working odd jobs to keep food on the table.

'''Eda:''' Hey, King, did you know that apple is a hat? [''aims Stab-Catcher'']

'''King:''' Really? [''puts an apple on his head, not knowing he's standing behind a target'']

'''Luz:''' King! Hey, no! King! [''drops camera, rushes to get King out of harm's way''] This week we're bounty hunters. Next week we could be anything. So, Mom, please don't be scared. I'm growing more and more every day, and I'm gonna do my best to become a full-fledged witch, and get home to you safe and sound. Te quiero, Mama. Te lo prometo, regresar a casa pronto.

'''Eda:''' Luz! Time to bring these bad boys to market!

'''Lilith:''' [''grunts''] Eda, do you own anything that isn't covered in feathers?

'''Eda:''' I had to deal with a curse for 30 years, so I think you can handle a few feathers.

[''Switch to Bonesborough, where a statue of [[Emperor Belos]] has been placed and Emperor's Coven guards are everywhere.'']

'''Luz:''' Wow, the Emperor is really taking over.

'''Eda:''' I see it too, Luz. And I'm trying to stay civil. [''kicks a demon decked out in Emperor's Coven apparel'']

[''Eda places the bag of captured demons on a scale. She and Luz wait while a shopkeeper behind a booth reading BOUNTY reads the scale''.]

'''Shopkeeper:''' Tsk. Your payment.

'''Eda:''' A single snail? Are you kidding me?

'''Shopkeeper:''' [''laughs''] Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't done yet. [''snaps snail in half'']

'''Eda:''' You can't do this to me. Do you know who I am?

'''Shopkeeper:''' Yeah, you're Eda the Owl Lady. What are you gonna do? We all know you're powerless now.

'''Eda:''' [''growls, tries to cast a spell but the spell circle disintegrates''] Ah! What the--

'''Townspeople:''' Ah, this is awkward; Uh-oh

'''Eda:''' I don't need your pity. [''holds up her own wanted poster''] [[Season 1|I was the most wanted criminal for years]]. You should fear me.

[''A passing garbageman grabs her wanted poster and puts it in the trash cart he is pushing''.]

'''Townspeople:''' No magic? Not so wanted anymore.

'''Lilith:''' [''laughs''] Don't worry, sister. At least my image still commands respect and fear.

[''She poses in front of a Coven recruitment poster in which she is making the same pose. The poster is promptly torched by a garbageman holding a flamethrower.'']

'''King:''' [''laughs''] You're a traitor.

'''Lilith:''' What's going on? This is anarchy. Who told you to do this?

[''Three new Coven recruitment posters of the [[Hunter|Golden Guard]] fly onto the wall''. ''Luz grabs one''.]

'''Luz:''' The Golden Guard? Did you know him in the Coven, Lilith?

'''Lilith:''' Unfortunately, I did. [''grabs the poster Luz did''] He always got special treatment because he was the genius teen prodigy. But he's really just a brat. If he's in charge... vomit. 

[''Lilith balls up the poster and throws it to a trashcan. It hovers right before entering, and then flies back and adheres itself to Lilith's face. She tries to rip it off, but gives up and stalks off.'']

'''Luz:''' [''side-hugs Eda''] Hey, I know! What we need is a confidence boost. Why don't we take on the biggest bounty we can find? It'll be great! [''runs up to a bulliten board labeled "Greg's List"'' ''and reads the posters there''] Hmm. Lost Cerberus, no. Witch cackling lessons? [''chuckles''] Uh, but maybe not today. Aha! [''takes poster down and shows it off''] There's something called a "Selkidomus" ravaging boats up and down the coast. We'll be on a high-seas adventure.

'''Eda:''' Hmm...no. We gotta keep a low profile while my powers are weakened. And we need fast cash. [''gasps''] How about this guy? [''gestures to a poster'']

'''Luz:''' "The Abominable Cutie Pie"?

'''Eda:''' No, no, no. I hear it's very dangerous. [''gasps''] And look, there he is.

[''She points to where the little demon is standing between two [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]] students, a lollipop in his hand.'']

'''Abominable Cutie Pie:''' [''giggles; runs off and climbs the statue of Emperor Belos''] You'll never catch me! 

[''Luz climbs the statue.''] 

'''Abominable Cutie Pie:''' [''deadpan''] You did it. You caught me. [''falls into Luz's hands'']

'''Luz:''' [''groans'']

[''King climbs up to Luz''.]

'''Eda:''' [''sighs''] Things aren't looking great, Lily. This bounty hunting stuff isn't putting food on the table.

'''Lilith:''' [''mumbling'']

'''Eda:''' Oh, I'm sure Luz could handle bigger bounties, but if we wanna eat we don't have the luxury to mess up even once.

'''Lilith:''' [''mumbling'']

'''Eda:''' No apple blood. I spent the money on griffin eggs for Luz. There's not a lot she can digest here, so I make sure to have her favorites around. 

[''The sisters head off.'']

'''Abominable Cutie Pie:''' That's rough, buddy. [''screams as King shoves him to the ground'']

[''Luz lands on top of the Abominable Cutie Pie after jumping to the ground.'']

'''Luz:''' This is awful. Eda wouldn't be in this situation if it weren't for me. [[A Lying Witch and a Warden|Maybe it would be better if I never came here]]. I can't change the past, but I can still change the future. I'm gonna help Eda and prove that I'm more than just a burden.

[''Cut to the Bonesborough Dock, where she slams the Selidomus's wanted poster onto a barrel.'']

'''Luz:''' The Selkidomus hunt. I want in.

[''Ship horn blowing.'']

'''[[Salty]]:''' You think you can handle this, squirt?

'''Luz:''' I can handle anything.

[''Salty lets Luz in and nods at the Golden Guard, who closes the window of his quarters bearing the Emperor's sigil.'']

[''Cut back to [[The Owl House (location)|The Owl House]], where Lilith holds her now burned recruitment poster. Eda sneaks up on her, wearing a bandolier of orange potions.'']

'''Eda:''' Hey, Lily! How do I look? [''shows off bandolier'']

'''Lilith:''' Uh...

'''Eda:''' [''flops onto the couch''] Getting scammed at the market was such a bummer, but it gave me an idea on how to earn a little more cash. You wanna come? I may not be at full power, but I can still make potions! [''dangles a potion over Lilith's head'']

'''Lilith:''' I am quite fine. Thank you. [''pushes Eda away''] 

'''Eda:''' Aight. [''walks to the door''] Have fun wallowing in self-pity and feeling bad for cursing me. Byeeeeeee! [''leaves'']

'''Lilith:''' [''rips poster bits out of her hair and sighs''] I guess I deserve this. There's gotta be a way to make it up to her. [''sees a potions book and grabs it''] Edalyn isn't the only Clawthorne with a talent for potions. [''chuckles as opens to a page for a scrying potion''] Ooh. I bet she would love a peek inside the castle.

[''Lilith rips the page out and starts backing away, straight into Hooty.'']

'''Hooty:''' New roomie check-in!

'''Lilith:''' [''screams, falls and drops book and page'']

'''Hooty:''' How's my bestie doing? [''notices page on his face''] A scrying potion!? [''gasps''] Lulu, you're trying to spy on your old buddies? I can help! We can find out their crushes. [''rubs his face against Lilith's''] We can give them cute couple names!

'''Lilith:''' [''shoves Hooty away''] No! [''stands''] I can do this alone. Don't follow me! [''starts to leave, stops in the doorway''] And don't call me Lulu! [''leaves''] 

'''Hooty:''' [''to himself''] A good friend would respect her wishes, but a better friend would help no matter what! [''goes after Lilith, closing the door as he goes'']

[''Cut to Salty's ship sailing through the Boiling Sea.'']

'''Luz:''' When we defeat the Selkidomus and get a boatload of snails, Eda won't have to worry about money for a long time.

'''King:''' King want a cracker!

'''Salty:''' All hands!

[''Luz joins the rest of the crew, lined up in front of Salty.'']

'''Salty:''' Alright, crew. The Selkidomus has been ravaging the coastline. It was last seen in the Simmering Shoals. You know the drill, "Snag the quarry, [''drops large sack of snails onto the deck''] get the money galore-y." We all do the work, we all get a cut.

[''All cheering.'']

'''Fish Sailor:''' I have many debts!

'''Salty:''' Till then, keep everything shipshape. This ain't no pleasure cruise. [''throws a broom to Luz''] Don't be a burden, sea squirt.

'''Luz:''' Oh, you don't have to worry about me.

[''Cut to barnacles on the front of the ship, then reveal Salty offer Luz a scraper. She gives King, on her shoulder, a look and uses a plant glyph to lower herself down. The barnacles grunt at her.'']

'''Luz:''' Hiss.

[''The barnacle all quiet down. Luz uses King's horn to scrape them off the ship. Cut to the bellows of the ship, which Salty is shoveling coal in to. He offers the shovel to Luz, but she shakes her head and pushes it away. She activates three fire glyphs directly into the bellows and closes the door. The ship's horn blows as the ship speeds ahead. Salty nods. Cut to the main deck, where the crew is clapping in time with Luz dancing. She turns around to reveal a large bug on her back. She launches it over King -- holding a cracker -- and various birds into the sea.'']

'''Luz:''' [''shivers, grunts'']

'''Salty:''' Well, ye had me confront my own biases and I got nothing but respect for ya now, squirt. I mean, sailor.

'''Luz:''' Thanks, Salty. You make me feel like a real part of the crew.

'''Salty:''' Well, that's because you arghhhh.

[''All cheering.'']

'''King:''' Boo! 

[''He waves his cracker in displeasure. One of the birds tries to grab it from him.'']

'''King:''' Hey, that's mine, you feather duster!

[''King and the bird both tug at the cracker. The ship hits a large wave, which sends King tumbling into the capitan's quarters. The doors close behind him''.]

'''King:''' Oof. Hey, King want a cracker! [''tries to open the doors, gasps, sees box of crackers on the desk''] Ooh!

[''King scrambles up the desk and grabs some crackers from the box. He notices a letter below the box''.]

'''King:''' Huh? [''picks up letter''] Is that the Emperor's sigil?

[''King turns up the brightness on the lamp next to him. The brighter light reveals that the room is covered in the Emperor's sigil.'']

'''King:''' This ship belongs to the Emperor? Oh, boy. I gotta tell Luz.

'''Golden Guard:''' Unfortunately, you won't have the chance.

'''King:''' [''screams'']

[''Cut to the middle of the woods, where Lilith is consulting the scrying potion recipe''.]

'''Lilith:''' Okay, next is [[Fire Bee|firebee]] honey.

[''Two firebees fly past her, into a whole colony. Lilith tries to follow, but the moment her foot enters their territory, they swarm together and fly at her.'' 

'''Lilith:''' [''screams'']

[''She draws a very shaky spell circle, which produces a sweating ice cube that would easily fit into a glass and offers no defense against a swarm of angry bees. She runs behind a tree, in which several firebees plunge their stingers.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''slides to the ground''] How can I get firebee honey without ice magic, or porcuspine quills without a sleeping spell? Who am I without magic, without a Coven? [''buries her head in her knees'']

'''Hooty:''' Without friends?

[''Lilith looks up, and Hooty is poking out of the ground next to her. She points at him accusingly''.]

'''Lilith:''' I said--

'''Hooty:''' [''stretches into her space''] You don't know how to get those firebees, but I can help.

'''Lilith:''' No! [''pushes him away''] I don't want your help. I told you not to follow me!

'''Hooty:''' If I were you, I would--

'''Lilith:''' You would what? [''stands and paces''] Because it doesn't matter. You aren't me. You're just some kind of weird bird-worm!

[''Hooty looks genuinely hurt by this''.]

'''Lilith:''' You have no idea what I'm going through. I have to do this alone, because if I can't... what kind of witch am I?

'''Hooty:''' Sorry, Lulu. I mean, sorry, Lilith. [''retreats into the ground'']

'''Lilith:''' Now, let's try this one more time. [''grabs a branch and looks at the colony''] 

[''Cut to Salty's ship, which enters darker waters.'']

'''Salty:''' We're here. The Simmering Shoals. Eyes peeled, mates.

[''A burning ship sails past. Sailors take off their hats and pay respects.'']

'''Salty:''' She's close.

[''The Selkidomus tail thwacks against the side of the ship.'']

'''Luz:''' She's here!

[''Luz corners the Selkidomus with ice pillars, then wraps it in vines. She starts pulling it onto the ship.'']

'''Salty:''' Help her, boys! Put your backs into it.

[''Luz ties the vine onto the ship.'']

'''Luz:''' I did it!

[''Explosion on deck. Luz falls. The Selkidomus breaks free and swims away. Luz sees a silhouette of someone carrying a bag of money.'']

'''Salty:''' Is that a-- a ghost pirate?

'''Luz:''' The money! We're being robbed.

[''The thief jumps off the ship onto a speedboat and heads to a nearby island. Luz summons a boat-shaped block of ice, jumps on, then propels herself with a fire spell after them.'']

'''Salty:''' [''laughing''] Show that specter what for, Luz.

[''Luz closes in on the shore. The ice has melted to barely support her feet. She loses her balance and is sent flying, colliding into the thief who drops the money at the shore. It opens and it gets washed away. Closeup of Luz and the thief's face.'']

'''Luz and thief:''' The money!

[''The thief's eyes are gold and grey. Luz walks over and knocks off her hat, revealing it's Eda.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda!

'''Eda:''' [''sheepishly chuckling''] Hey.

'''Luz:''' Why are you robbing our ship? And what happened to your legs?

'''Eda:''' It's called "disguising your tracks". Now, why were you on that ship to begin with? You coulda gotten killed!

'''Golden Guard:''' That can still be arranged.

[''Ad break'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Hello, criminals. What's about to happen should be relatively painless, if you just do what I say.

'''Luz:''' And why would we do that?

'''Golden Guard:''' Because none of you can use real magic.

'''Eda:''' You don't know that!

'''Golden Guard:''' Maybe not, but I do know you're standing on a plant that eats flesh.

'''Golden Guard:''' Okay--the human will remain a sailor to repay all the money she lost, while the Owl Lady will be arrested, again, for attacking one of the Emperor's ships.

'''Luz:''' "Emperor's ship"?

'''Eda:''' They're the only ones worth robbing. Why are you guys hunting the Selkidomus? It's a peaceful creature, and you're provoking it!

'''Golden Guard:''' The Emperor ordered me to slay one. I'm just following orders.

'''Eda:''' Well, I'm just gonna smack you around a bit! [''rips off her arm to use as a weapon, swings but misses and is blasted away'']

'''Luz:''' Leave Eda alone!

'''Golden Guard:''' How about... I leave you dangling above the Boiling Sea!?

'''Golden Guard:''' Around these parts, just the steam is enough to cause third-degree burns.

'''Golden Guard:''' But I don't have to be that mean. No one will have to be a sailor or get arrested, if one of you follows those Selkidomus tracks and slays the beast. Here! I'll help!

[''He materializes a sword. Luz whines.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Ugh, you're making this difficult... Go, or I drown the bird.

[''The Golden Guard lifts up the birdcage and pulls the shade aside, revealing King.'']

'''King:''' Weh?

[''The Golden Guard drops the shade.'']

'''King:''' Ah, it's dark now. [''snoring'']

'''Luz:''' Fine. I'll do it.

'''Eda:''' Luz, wait! Luz!

[''Cut to Lilith, encircled by a ring of firebees.'']

'''Lilith:''' I am not one to be trifled with, bees. I am a witch... unhinged!

[''She swings at the bees with a stick, making battlecries. Lilith pulls it out and realizes it's burnt.'']

'''Lilith:''' What? No, no, no, no, no!

[''She falls to the ground, ring of bees closing in.'']

'''Lilith:''' I can't do this alone. I need help!

[''Hooty emerges out of the ground.'']

'''Hooty:''' I'm here for you, Lulu. No witch is an island. Now face my wrath!

'''Lilith:''' [''clapping''] Ooh.

[''Cut to Luz and Eda.'']

'''Eda:''' Luz, don't hurt the Selkidomus. We can find another way out of this.

'''Luz:''' You heard what he said, Eda. If you and King want to be free... then I have to do this alone.

'''Eda:''' What's this "alone" business? Don't you remember? Us weirdos have to--

'''Luz:''' What? Stick together? Because you stuck with me, you lost your magic. You almost got turned to stone, and now you can't even afford your apple blood because you're worried about what I need to eat. It's my fault all this happened. That's why I've got to do this alone. I'll make it all up to you, Eda the Owl Lady. I promise.

[''Luz falls backwards, down into the Selkidomus' den.'']

'''Eda:''' Luz!

[''Luz falls straight onto the Selkidomus' head. She stirs and roars.'']

'''Luz:''' Whoa!

[''She dodges a Selkidomus attack, and holds up a glyph.'']

'''Luz:''' All right, let's do this.

[''Luz summons an ice pillar, but Eda swings on a vine and grabs Luz mid-air, tackling her into cover.'']

'''Eda:''' You think throwing your life away is gonna help me? Well, it won't. [[A Lying Witch and a Warden|You helped me find King's crown when you barely knew me]]. [[Young Blood, Old Souls|You saved me from turning to stone and you even got me talking to my sister again]]. So, unfortunately for you, my life is pretty great, because I'm friends with Luz, the human.  

[''Luz starts tearing up, but stops when Eda grabs her cheeks.'']  

'''Eda:''' Now, your guilt-ridden brain is clouding your judgement. There's gotta be a way out of this, where no one has to get hurt.

[''Behind them, a baby Selkidomus sounds.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasping''] Eda, do you want to learn your first glyph?

[''Above them, the Golden Guard is playing with King's birdcage. He lifts the shade. King wakes up and spins around.'']

'''King:''' Weh?

[''He drops the shade. King sighs in relief. The Golden Guard lifts the shade. King wakes up and spins around.'']

'''King:''' Weh?

[''He drops the shade. King sighs in relief. The Golden Guard lifts the shade. King wakes up and spins around.'']

'''King:''' Weh?

[''He drops the shade. King sighs in relief.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' [''laughing''] You're actually weirdly endearing.

'''King:''' No, I'm not. [''snoring'']

[''The Golden Guard looks up and sees shadows on the wall of Eda and Luz fighting the Selkidomus. Luz slays her, and begins dragging her head into the Golden Guard's view.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Oh, that thing smells awful. Why are you touching it with your hands? Gross.

'''Luz:''' You're gross. Now give me King.

'''Golden Guard:''' Actually, he smells pretty bad too. Take him.

[''He tosses her King's birdcage.'']

'''Golden Guard:''' Thank you for your service. You can find your own way home. And try to stay out of trouble. [''looking sinister''] The Emperor is not a merciful man. [''waves''] Byeeeee!

[''The Golden Guard gets on his staff and vanishes. Luz blows a raspberry after he leaves. Beside the Selkidomus corpse, actually made entirely out of plant magic, Eda is drawing light glyphs and casting them, like when Luz [[The Intruder|first learned it]]. Luz walks up to her.'']

'''Eda:''' My first glyph. Did I do good?

'''Luz:''' Yeah. You did great.

[''Enter the Selkidomus and her baby. The baby comes up to Luz and hugs her.'']

'''Luz:''' Baby! Awww.

'''King:''' Wait, what is that?

'''Eda:''' Don't worry, King. Once the mother saw we weren't a threat to her baby, she calmed down. [t''o the Selkidomus''] This area is dangerous. You need to move further out into the sea.

[''The Selkidomus nods, then regurgitates a pile of golden selkigris.'']

'''Eda:''' Hot dang! It gave you the treasure of the sea.

'''Luz:''' Gold? Tuna?

'''Eda:''' It's selkigris. Ah, people pay big money for it at the [[Night Market]]. Ah, feel that money, Luz. [''lathers a handful of the stuff on Luz's face'']

'''Luz:''' No, Eda! Stop!

'''Eda:''' Luxuriate in it. What, you don't like to luxuriate? There's a whole pile of luxury right in here.

'''Luz:''' No, no, no, no, no.

[''Eda throws Luz into the Selkigris.'']

'''Eda:''' Move over!

[''Eda jumps in, flattening the pile.'']

'''Luz:''' Eda!

[''They all laugh. Cut to Lilith at the Owl House, putting ointment on Hooty's stings.'']

'''Lilith:''' I'm sorry for sending you away before. It's hard for me to ask for help.

'''Hooty:''' It's okay. I'm sorry for being all nosy-nosy. But hey, Lulu, every friendship comes with its ups and downs. Right, best friend?

'''Lilith:''' I'm not commenting on that, Hootsifer.

'''Hooty''': A nickname? [''laughing''] Hoot.

[''The cauldron with Lilith's scrying spell finishes brewing. It glows and bubbles.'']

'''Lilith:''' [''gasps''] The scrying potion, it's ready.

[''A tired Eda, Luz, and King walk through the door.'']

'''Eda:''' We're home. [''trips over Hooty'']

'''Lilith:''' Eda, come here. I have a gift for you. To prove that I'm trustworthy, I'm giving you a peek inside the Emperor's castle.

[''Cauldron shows a corridor at the Emperor's Castle that splits into two paths. Four distracted guards at each side are doing nothing. A guard on the left turns to the guard on the right.'']

'''Guard 1:''' 'Sup?

'''Guard 2:''' 'Sup?

'''Luz:''' What are we supposed to do with this?

'''Lilith:''' Whatever you want. Don't you see? These troops don't know what to do with themselves. So, go crazy. Pull whatever pranks your heart desires. They're clueless without me.

'''Eda:''' Oh, Lily, you couldn't have been more right. And that Golden Guard... what a chump. Oh, I'm in a good mood. Who wants to get takeout and draw faces on Hooty?

'''Hooty:''' [''shakes head''] No...

'''King and Luz:''' Yay! Me, me, me! I do! Yeah! I'm in!

'''Lilith:''' I'll protect you, Hootsifer.

[''Zoom into the cauldron. The Owl House is still having their conversation about take-out offscreen.'']

'''Eda:''' Alright, what do we wanna eat?

'''Luz:''' Anything but seafood.

'''King:''' Crackers.

'''Eda:''' We're not ordering crackers.

'''Hooty:''' Bees!

'''Lilith:''' I'm fine with whatever. Things are starting to feel right again.

[''The potion zooms in through a wall, to where Belos is pieicing together the portal door. He puts his mask on as he turns around.'']

'''Belos:''' Knock, knock, human.

[''Outside the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]], [[Luz Noceda|Luz]], her [[Echo Mouse|echo mouse]],  and [[King]] are trying new [[Magic|glyph]] combinations. The first one shown is of a [[Wind Spell|small whirlwind]], the second one is a [[Water Fountain Spell|water fountain]], the third one is a [[petrification]] glyph that turns the toy on top of it into stone, and Luz is then shown drawing a fourth glyph.'']

'''Luz:''' [''finishes drawing the glyph''] Alright, maybe it's this one! 

[''She activates the glyph, and a [[Monster Summoning Spell|monstrous claw]] sprouts from it. Luz, upon seeing it, screams in surprise and backs up. [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] instantly bursts through the door, with [[Owl Staff|her staff]] in hand, and destroys the claw, which turns into goo which splatters [[Owlbert]], King, and Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Safe! [''both her and King wipe the goo off their faces''] Thanks, Eda. [''grabs her notepad and a pencil''] That was.. definitely not the one. [''crosses out the glyph on her notepad and labeling "NO" next to it'']

[''Eda picks up the petrified miniature toy and it crumbles.'']

'''Eda:''' Eugh. [''shivers''] What are you doing out here?

'''Luz:''' I started going through [[Emperor Belos|Philip Wittebane]][[Philip Wittebane's diary|'s diary]] again. Since my trip with Lilith, I found out that a lot of his margin doodles were actually unfinished glyph combos. [''sighs and looks down dejectedly''] I thought maybe they could help with the portal door but... [''the claw rises again but is swallowed by [[Hooty]]''] no luck.

'''Eda:''' Maybe it's for the best. I don't like that you're still thinking about that creep.

'''Luz:''' [''sighs''] I know. [''curls up and pulls her hood up''] I just miss my mom. [''King looks at Eda and points at Luz'']

'''Eda:''' [''kneels down''] Let's take a break, huh? [''no response from Luz''] Maybe... I could tell you... a story? [''Luz instantly approaches Eda's face with a look of curiousness.'']

'''Luz:''' [''excitedly''] Like a backstory ''kind'' of story?

'''Eda:''' Yes. [''Luz, King, her echo mouse and Hooty excitedly sit.'']

'''Hooty:''' Hoooooot!

'''Eda:''' This is the story of how I met the coolest, baddest, kick-buttiest witch of all time: [[Raine Whispers]].

['''[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]], but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.''']

'''<nowiki/>'''

[''Cut to Young Eda holding a pack of flashcards in her hands; the first one says, "Things abominations probably shouldn't do." The second card says: "The Titan's five humors"'']

'''Young Eda:''' Okay. [[The Titan|Titan's]] five humors.

[''Scene cuts to the two Clawthorne sisters walking but only their feet are seen; Young Eda is kicking a [[grudgby]] ball.'']

'''[[Lilith Clawthorne|Young Lilith]]:''' Hmm... Earth, bone, blood, bile and, uh... [''sighs''] I always forget the last one! It's on the tip of my tongue, it's...

'''Young Eda:''' [''eagerly''] It's... [''starts making a snake-like sound'']

'''Young Lilith:''' [''slowly''] Snakes...?

'''Young Eda:''' Breath! [''breathes on Young Lilith and laughs'']

'''Young Lilith:''' Eda, you have smilk breath. Gross! 

[''Young Eda continues laughing and walks away. Young Lilith follows her.''] 

'''Young Lilith:''' Give me another question.

'''Young Eda:''' Alright, alright. On Scaburary 40th, the day Belos declared the Isles an empire... [''kicks the grudgby ball towards Young Lilith''] Think fast!

'''Young Lilith:''' [''catches the ball with her hands in mid-air''] Eda, we don't have time to play around. [''hands her the grudgby ball and takes the flashcards''] Tryouts for the [[Emperor's Coven]] are just around the corner.

'''Young Eda:''' [''balances the grudgby ball on her head; chuckles and snorts''] Seven months isn't just around the corner.

'''Young Lilith:''' Your turn. It's a half-moon, and you're mixing a leadfoot potion. What ratio of Blackroot Quills to Iron Ash do you use?

'''Young Eda:''' Is it a waning or a waxing moon? [''draws a spell circle in the air and a stem starts to sprout from her head'']

'''Young Lilith:''' Oh, uh, I-I don't think that matters.

'''Young Eda:''' Yeah, sure it does! [''the two stop walking''] I-If it's a waxing moon, it's a 2-to-1 mix, but if it's a waning moon, the Blackroot Quills lose their umph, and you gotta double down to a 4-to-1. 

[''Eda traces another spell circle in the air which makes the stem shrinks down to a seedling and catches the grudgby ball. She then plucks off the seedling and blows it away. Meanwhile, Lilith checks her notes.'']

'''Young Lilith:''' You're correct. [''dejectedly''] On both accounts. Huh. [''walks to Young Eda excitedly''] Imagine us both getting in. We'll train together.

'''Young Eda:''' We'll prank together. [''takes the flashcards and tosses them in the air; but Young Lilith summons them and they go nicely into her hand'']

'''Young Lilith:''' We'll study ancient history together. [''Eda twirls her around'']

'''Young Eda:''' We'll kick [''kicks the grudgby ball upwards''] butt together!

'''Young Lilith:''' [''catches the grudgby ball''] Help demons and witches together!

'''Young Eda:''' [''dances around a post''] Take over the world together! Nothing can stop the Clawthorne sisters! Our rivals shall be CRUSHED beneath our feet! Even the Titan shall gasp in fear!

[''Young Lilith suddenly gasps.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Yeah. [''snaps fingers''] Like that.

'''Young Lilith:''' No! [''points upwards''] Look! We're gonna be late!

[''Young Eda looks upwards, just in time to see the minute hand of the clock above her move to 12. The clock bell starts tolling. Young Eda gasps, then jumps off the ledge and runs after Lilith, both rushing towards school. At Hexside, students are seen at the front of the school as Eda and Lilith run in. A couple of students are seen walking and sitting on the grass. At the stairway, Young [[Darius]] flicks an abomination ball into Young [[Alador Blight|Alador's]] face, and both and Young [[Odalia Blight|Odalia]] laugh.'']

'''Young Eda:''' See? [''punches Young Lilith's arm''] We're gonna be fine.

[''The school bell rings. A ring of fire suddenly appears in the doorway which bursts into a huge fire. Several students gasp and turn around. From the fire, out comes [[Principal Faust]], and his neck slowly turns around as the fire behind him extinguishes. He then grabs a clipboard and scratches it with his pointy fingernails. The students start to hurry inside.'']

'''Principal Faust:''' Detention. Detention. Suspension! [''scratches loudly onto the clipboard as a younger [[Principal Bump|Bump]] walks over'']

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Principal Faust, don't you think you're judging these students a touch... harshly?

'''Principal Faust:''' Not at all. These students are already late to being early, and that's a slippery slope.

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' [''nervously''] But if you keep expelling students, we won't have a graduating class. 

[''Principal Faust's head turns around slowly with a crack. Bump winces and starts sweating.'']

'''Principal Faust:''' I'm just enforcing school policy.

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' That ''you'' added to. Y-You expelled the captain of our grudgby team because his shoes didn't meet your "appropriately squeaky" regulation.

'''Principal Faust:''' [''unfazed''] Too squeaky? A distraction. Too quiet? Can't hear them. Can't trust them. Some students are... irredeemable.

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' None of them are beyond redemption. [''nervously''] I would stake my career on it.

[''Principal Faust's head slowly turns around with a look of curiosity once more with a crack when a flying grudgby ball starts attacking both of them'']

'''Principal Faust:''' What is that thing?!

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Ow, ow, ow!

[''Scene slowly pans to Young Lilith and Eda sneaking in the bushes as Young Eda draws a spell circle which moves the bushes aside to reveal a small secret door hidden. Young Eda opens the door for Young Lilith but they see someone coming. Young Lilith signals for her to go through the door but the door is quickly shut in her face which makes her groan in pain. Young Eda rearranges the bushes hastily as she is met by an angered Principal Faust and Bump.'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''humming''] Hey, Fausty. Vice Princey B. 

[''Scene reveals both Bump and Faust looking angry as the latter holds up the flying grudgby ball with a smoking back. Cut to the principal's office. Eda is sitting down looking curious.'']

'''Principal Faust:''' Miss Clawthorne? Do you know why I keep you around?

'''Young Eda:''' My innate talents? My unbeatable charm?

'''Principal Faust:''' [''quickly''] No. [''pulls a string hanging beside him; a stack of books land in the table; Eda looks at them''] Because to fight evil, you must understand evil. All your misdeeds, pranks, schemes, they have given me insight into the depravity that lurks within the minds of children.

'''Young Eda:''' Wow, this is really shocking. [''curious''] I thought there'd be more. Hmm.

[''Principal Faust grabs and scratches a file folder with Eda's name on it, and starts reading it while pacing back and forth'']

'''Principal Faust:''' You're close with your sister, Lilith, I see. Plan on trying out for the Emperor's Coven, together? Commendable.

'''Young Eda:''' [''lies on the chair''] Yeah, I do kinda rule.

'''Principal Faust:''' Too bad you'll be ineligible... when I EXPEL you!

'''Young Eda:''' [''sits up; shocked''] What?! You can't do that, I'll be separated from Lily!

'''Principal Faust:''' Maybe you should've thought of that before you filled the detention pit with green gelatin. [''shows her the file folder'']

'''Young Eda:''' [''defensive''] It was ''his'' birthday! He liked it! Please, Principal Faust, I'll do anything!

[''Principal Faust chuckles and knocks on the wall behind him; part of the wall slides and Bump comes out'']

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Uh, yes, sir?

'''Principal Faust:''' No child is beyond redemption. Didn't you stake your career on it? [''Bump stares at Eda, who chuckles and waves nervously'']

[''Scene cuts to the hallway of the school. Principal Faust's shadow is seen looming from above, and several students start to hide, run away and scream at the sight of him.'']

'''Principal Faust:''' Every year, Hexside participates in a special training program called [[Instructing Future Witches of Tomorrow]]. [''When they reach the locker, Faust slides the glass door open and takes a ribbon from a statue inside.''] I attend with our most gifted students and we return with blue ribbons as a testament to my... [''admires the ribbon he's holding and realizes what he said''] I mean, our excellence. [''Young Eda looks at Bump, who just looks at her worriedly''] Unfortunately...

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' You expelled our most gifted student for chewing too loudly in the cafeteria.

'''Principal Faust:''' Disgusting monster. [''Turns around with his head bending at 90 sideward; it goes back into place once he's faced Eda''] This year, you can represent Hexside. Bring back a blue ribbon, and you can remain a student here. Come back empty-handed, and I will savor the expulsion. [''Eda's face scrunches''] [''to Bump; quickly''] And you'll go with her! [''walking away''] If anything goes wrong, I might have to find a new vice principal.

[''Cut to black. At the convention center, where IFWOT is being held, a line of people are waiting to get their badges, among them are Bump, who is reading a pamphlet, and Eda, looking bored.'']

'''Young Eda:''' I can't believe I agreed to this.

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' This will be fine, perfectly fine. You can go five minutes without setting anything on fire, right? [''Scene cuts to Eda having summoned a small fire on her fingertip; upon seeing Bump looking at her, she quickly extinguishes the flame''] I know you have a reputation around school, but I just see a talented young witch. And I'll wager those stories about you turning the school inside out are just urban legends.

'''Young Eda:''' That was a fun day. [''Bump looks away annoyed then grabs something out of his pocket'']

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Let's try this. [''he squishes a toy octopus''] This is a stress toy. [''he hands it to Eda who takes it''] Anytime you feel the urge to cause chaos, just squeeze. [''Eda squishes it too hard until it pops, surprising Bump; cut to the two walking towards the entrance of the center, Eda putting on a name badge''] Prepare yourself, Edalyn. The IFWOT is a battleground of magic and skill. Witches who successfully complete these courses have gone on to do incredible things. You will face some of the greatest competition here.

'''Young Eda:''' Hmph. 

[''Bump and Eda enter the center expectantly to find everything unexpectedly boring. One side of the IFWOT banner falls off. A Coven Scout is testing the mic when it suddenly spins and ringing noises come out from it, causing him to cover his ears. One student from Glandus High gets a food from the snack bar and he tastes it, but immediately dislikes it.'']

'''Glandus High student:''' Ugh! 

[''He looks around, and seeing no one, he leaves the food back in the bar and walks away shyly. Cut to two professors sitting on two chairs, both looking bored; one of them is about to drift off. Cut to a weirded-out Eda and a not-so-surprised Bump.'']

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Wow. I grossly misjudged the tone here. 

[''The ground suddenly rumbles. Vines suddenly wrap the stage until it grows a stem and its head, which splits open. A much younger [[Terra Snapdragon]] appears from it. Everyone looks at her in wonder.'']

'''Terra:''' Greetings, students, educators! My name is Terra Snapdragon, [''bows''] Head Witch of the Plant Coven! But today, I'm head proctor for the... [''looks up, and sees the IFWOT banner, and looks at it with disdain''] IFWOT? Seriously?

[''She snaps her fingers and vines begin to cover the IFWOT banner (which eventually makes the Coven Scout repairing it fall from there) and it is replaced by vines and pretty flowers sprouting from it.'']

'''Terra:''' I'm here to "Help Enhance Coven Know-how"! Welcome.. to HECK! [''minimal applause''] Oh, this is my first year hosting, and I am thrilled. Today, you little sweet peas will go through your rigorous exercises that will enhance your intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are you excited?

[''The audience cheers.'']

'''Terra:''' Lovely! Remember, this won't be a bed of roses. [''A Coven Scout appears and opens a suitcase with blue ribbons inside''] Only the best of the best will be rewarded. The failures will be ground into mulch for my garden!

[''Everyone is shocked and terrified by this. A Glandus High student then starts bawling. Just then, a Coven Scout comes and whispers to Terra.'']

'''Terra:''' Illegal? Oh, we'll see about that, won't we, children? Let the activities begin! [''she throws some petals and the audience cheers again'']

[''Eda looks at Bump; he just gives her a thumbs-up. Cut to a scene where Eda is walking to a stand labeled "TRUST".'']

'''Instructor:''' Tell me, what makes the covens strong? Strength in numbers? A dark pact? Well, it is all of those things but also, [''he demonstrates a trust fall with a Coven Scout''] trust. Trust in our fellow covenmates. So, we'll begin doing trust falls. Any volunteers?

'''Young Eda:''' [''confident''] Sounds easy enough. [''she raises her hand and walks to the front'']

'''Instructor:''' Very good, very good. And this will be your partner. [''In front of her is a blob-like student, much to her dislike''] Now, you close your eyes, and trust that your covenmate will catch you.

'''Blob:''' Whoo! [''Eda groans and turns around; she lets herself fall but her body passes through the blob.''] Hm? 

[''The blob looks down to find the upper part of Eda's body has turned into a skeleton; everyone runs away screaming. The blob starts crying.'']

'''Blob:''' NOT AGAIN! [''sobs''] 

[''Eda's body suddenly vanishes in a puff of smoke, and she suddenly reappears on the back of the proctor and blob.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Ta-da! I'm here all night, folks.

[''The instructor and the blob glare at her angrily; the proctor writes something on his clipboard. Eda's face changes from triumphant to disappointment. Cut to a part of the venue, where Eda is looking at her drink with disdain.'']

'''Young Eda:''' I never should've come here. [''she sips on her drink but is disgusted by the taste''] Blech! Even the free junk is junk!

[''She throws the drink away but it is stopped by an unseen force. A younger Raine, wearing a [[St. Epiderm]] uniform, walks over.'']

'''Young Raine:''' I don't know who you are, but you are a riot. [''they hand the drink back to Eda; she takes it'']

'''Young Eda:''' Uh, no, I ''excel'' at functions such as these. Didn't you see how impressed everyone was when I faked my death? I even ''love'' the horrid liquids they serve.

'''Young Raine:''' [''chuckles''] Yeah, they always give us the off-brand junk. Let me try something. [''they walk over to Eda's cup and they whistle in it''] Don't worry, I didn't spit in it.

[''Eda tastes the drink and finds it good'']

'''Young Eda:''' Whoa! [''sips more''] Hey, that's actually good! How'd you change the flavor?

'''Young Raine:''' [''walks over and sits on a cardboard box next to Eda''] Little trick I taught myself: changing the chemistry of a liquid with sound waves. See, bard magic can be cool! People just don't give it a shot!

'''Young Eda:''' [''chuckles and snorts''] All right, I get it. If you whistle loud enough, can you make all this.. less of a drag?

'''Young Raine:''' [''bored''] I wish. This is my third time. Always the same boring activities, same boring faces. [''screams upon seeing Eda's head, which has turned into a skull'']

[''Eda's head suddenly turns into Raine's direction, and with a puff of smoke, her face is back.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Till wittle ole me? [''blinks twice'']

'''Young Raine:''' [''laughs''] Yeah. [''continues laughing'']

[''Eda suddenly spots the ribbons tied on Raine's side and is shocked.'']

'''Young Eda:''' How'd you get those?!

'''Young Raine:''' [''holds up the ribbon for her to see''] Oh, these are from last year. [''tucks the ribbons back into their side''] Maybe if you stick with me, I'll show you how to get one of your own.

'''Young Eda:''' All right, I'm Eda Clawthorne. [''she holds out her hand'']

'''Young Raine:''' Raine Whispers. [''they take it, and both smile'']

[''Cut to front of a stand which says "INTELLIGENCE". Four students are seated there, among them are Eda and Raine. A proctor points to the board, letting the students guess what is behind the question mark. Everyone starts drawing. The first student shows an illustration of planet Earth. The second student shows his drawing: an eyeball. Scene pans to Eda drawing something and reveals her drawing to be what looks like a butt. Upon seeing it, the proctor is looking disgusted and covers a student's eyes. Just then, Raine connects their drawing to Eda's, making their drawing a grudgby ball. The proctor reveals the answer, and upon checking it, he nods in satisfaction.''] 

[''A flash of light appears, and scene cuts to Raine and Eda in front of a stand that says "CREATIVITY". They are seen assembling a miniature Rube Goldberg machine, which resembles the words, "THIS STINKS". Upon being seen by one of the proctors, he growls angrily. Eda then starts the chain reaction of the machine, which ends with a fountain of water transferring from a cup to another cup held by Raine, who gives it to the proctor. Upon drinking it, he gives the duo a thumbs-up, satisfied by the drink. Both then fist-bump.'']

[''Scene then cuts to a stand called "STRENGTH". Eda and Raine, along with their opponents, are dressed a sumo wrestlers. They face each other's backs, then, at the Coven Scout's whistle, the teams walk off in different directions. The opposing team turns around, but stops. Scene cuts to Raine rolling Eda like a bowling ball towards the opponents, who are knocked out like bowling pins. Raine walks over and the two do their special handshake, ending it with a fistbump. Scene then cuts to the two catching and playing a grudgby ball outside the convention center.'']

'''Young Eda:''' I wonder what I'll get a ribbon for. Strength. Wit. [''poses with the grudgby ball on her foot''] Radiance.

'''Young Raine:''' You'll get one for being a dingus!

'''Young Eda:''' Well, you're gonna get one for -- think fast! [''She kicks the grudgby ball towards Raine, only for them to catch it swiftly and throw it back to her. Eda blushes''] Why do you come here? You're not like the other kids. You're -- I don't know, you're cool. [''throws the ball to Raine; they catch it'']

'''Young Raine:''' St. Epiderm isn't cheap. But if I make the school look good, I get a scholarship. What about you? [''throws the ball back to Eda; she also catches it'']

'''Young Eda:''' Made a deal with the devil. [''she spins the ball with her fingertip''] Our principal's gonna expel me unless I come back with a ribbon. 

'''Young Raine:''' [''chuckles''] Chance at redemption?

'''Young Eda:''' Nah, [''she sits down looking discouraged; Raine walks over and sits next to her''] I think I'm being too used to embarrass our vice principal. As if he doesn't do that to himself already. 

[''Cut to Bump looking at his clipboard. Someone goes towards his direction and looks like he is trying to hi-five Bump, but he turns out to be talking to a Coven Scout behind Bump, making him embarrassed.''] 

'''Young Eda:''' It stinks, but, I've got a sister at Hexside. She's kind of my only friend. It'd be a bummer if that got taken away.

'''Young Raine:''' Well, [''they nudge Eda''] you won't have to worry about that. After the closing ceremony, we're home free. [''Eda chuckles'']

[''Cut to the stadium. The students are walking towards the center. Eda looks at Bump, who is holding a stress toy and still looking worried. Eda simply hold two fingers up, which calms Bump down. Vines start to sprout from the stage and a head which splits open once more as Terra appears.'']

'''Terra:''' Congratulations, students! It seems nearly everyone earned a ribbon. [''two Coven Scouts appear and hold a small glass tray with ribbons''] You must be so proud of yourselves. 

[''Raine offers to hold their hand out to Eda; she takes it. Terra's mood immediately and suddenly changes from polite to sinister.'']

'''Terra:''' Well, you shouldn't be. [''the students gasp''] This training camp is a joke. There was nothing challenging about those challenges! And this... [''holds up Eda's drawing of a butt earlier''] was the LAST STRAW. 

[''She tears up the paper angrily. Everyone in the crowd gasps as Eda and Raine wince and look at each other.'']

'''Terra:''' Before we hand out any ribbons... I think we need one more activity. 

[''Everyone gasps as a hedge-like maze traps the students inside it.'']

'''Terra:''' We'll play my personal favorite game: Covens vs. Wilds. [''the students look on worriedly''] Look at your badges, and you'll see if you're a Coven Witch [''Eda's badge places her in the Coven group''] or a Wild Witch. [''Raine's badge places them in the Wild group; they let go of Eda's hand''] Coven Witches, you have 20 minutes to capture every Wild Witch. [''Both teams back up and face each other angrily except for Eda and Raine''] If you succeed, everyone on your team gets a ribbon! Wild Witches, you may earn a ribbon... if you put on a good show. And to encourage your shrinking violets, I'll allow any use of magic! We're in HECK, people! Let's have some FUN!

[''Cut to black. Back inside the maze, everyone from both teams start attacking each other; Terra looks at them lovingly'']

'''Terra:''' Ah, I would've been such a good mom. 

[''Eda and Raine continuously dodge all the attacks and with one last look at each other, they go their separate ways. Raine draws a huge spell circle on the floor; they tap it and a burst of light emits from it. Eda shields her eyes and upon uncovering them, escapes. She uses her magic to block all attacks against her as she flees, and makes a Wild Witch trip over. An abomination looms behind her, to her surprise, but then transforms into a staircase as Eda climbs on top of it, and pounces from a side of the maze, landing back in a free area. She hides behind the wall as two Wild Witches run past her and she sighs. Eda looks back at Bump, who shrugs.'']

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' Don't move! 

[''Eda is taken by surprise as she comes across two of her fellow Coven Witches'']

'''St. Epiderm student:''' Wait. She's one of us. [''to Eda''] Come with us. We've got a plan to catch all the Wild Witches.

'''Young Eda:''' I'm not goin' anywhere! This is crazy! That plant lady is off her gourd!

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' Don't you want a ribbon?

'''St. Epiderm student:''' My parents say if I don't come home with a ribbon, I better not come home at all. [t''he three look behind them to find a fellow Coven Witch dragging a Wild Witch tied in red rope''] They're just watching out for my best interests.

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' So, I heard there's this one kid who's been coming here for years.

'''St. Epiderm student:''' Yeah, that's Raine, my classmate! Somehow they always have the best juice! And they don't share it with anyone!

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' I heard they're one of the strongest witches here. And they're a bard! Crazy, right?

'''Young Eda:''' Not really. Bard magic can be cool.

'''St. Epiderm student:''' If we take them out, the rest should be a breeze. You with us?

'''Young Eda:''' Uh...

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' We'll take that as a yes! [''the two drag Eda away'']

[''As Terra watches the battle in satisfaction, she notices a newly imprisoned Wild Witch being dragged by a Coven Witch.'']

'''Terra:''' Welcome, welcome. Oh, don't look so wilted. You've got great seats now. [''the Wild Witch is tossed aside with all the other Wild Witches'']

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Uh, Miss Terra?

'''Terra:''' Head Witch Snapdragon, if you please. Enjoying the show?

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Yes. Well, your show is actually in violation of several school rules, convention hall safety guidelines and child safety acts. I'm sure it's an honest mistakes so why don't we just stop this activity and-- [''he shows her the rule book but it is promptly destroyed by Terra's vines'']

'''Terra:''' ''I'' make the rules, sweet pea. Oh, looks like there's only one crafty little Wild Witch left! [''Raine is then shown running across the maze passing several other unconscious Coven Witches''] Will the Covens win? Or the sprout? 

[''Eda, the Glandus High student and the St. Epiderm student walk sneakily.'']

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' That must be the bard.

'''St. Epiderm student:''' We'll surprise them. 

[''They both hide in separate walls, looking out for Raine. Eda is about to pass them both, but the St. Epiderm student pulls her out just in time for Raine to come running. They are being chased by a Coven Witch, and is eventually cornered. They inhale deeply and loudly whistle as the Coven Witch is blasted and knocked out onto a wall. The Glandus High student motions for the St. Epiderm student to attack. They both come out of their hiding place as he summons a large amount of water which knocks Raine onto a wall and making them drop onto their knees. Raine cowers, terrified, as the Coven Witches surround them.'']

'''Cyclops demon girl:''' We got ya now.

'''St. Epiderm student:''' For the Covens! [''he summons another amount of water and is about to attack Raine when suddenly, both he and the girl are suddenly lifted into the air by an unseen force.'']

'''Young Raine:''' Huh?

[''Eda is revealed to have lifted the two into the air as she walks over to Raine with a devilish expression on her face.'']

'''St. Epiderm student:''' What are you doing?! [''he and the girl are tossed aside by Eda'']

'''Terra:''' An interesting development? A showdown, perhaps? Let's give them plenty of room... to FIGHT! 

[S''he makes the maze disappear as everyone starts shouting "Fight!" Bump is in turmoil as he continuously squeezes multiple stress toys in both of his hands. Raine and Eda stare at each other angrily. Both are about to punch the other and yell as Terra watches in anticipation. But when they stop, they instead do a fist bump as they perform their special handshake which leads to them creating a spell circle which emits a flash of light, aiming at Terra. She blocks the attack with her vines, but some part of the fire reached her hair; she puts it out.'']

'''Terra:''' Never a rose without a few thorns, I see.

'''Young Eda:''' Yeah, well, we got tired of your stupid little challenge.

'''Young Raine:''' And your plant puns! 

[''An offended Terra is slowly lowered down by the head of the plant as she angrily walks towards Eda and Raine, both of which are nervous. Then suddenly, Terra laughs.'']

'''Terra:''' Delightful! [''Raine and Eda are surprised''] Feisty witches do make the best leaders! I especially like you, sprout. [''pokes Raine's nose''] But... I can't reward disobedience. So, everyone is poisoned! [''she raises her vines but a Coven Scout appears and whispers to her, making her irritated''] That's illegal too? [''the Coven Scout nods''] Ugh! Fine. Instead, no one gets a ribbon this year, everyone loses!

[''Everyone starts booing, particularly at Eda and Raine.'']

'''Young Eda:''' I hope this was worth it.

'''Young Raine:''' Actually...

'''Vice Principal Bump:''' Eda! I am so proud of you! But also, [''Raine winks at her and leaves''] I think we're toast. My career is over, and you'll probably be expelled and end up selling garbage at the Night Market but, what a way to go! [''Terra, who has seemingly overheard the conversation, taps Bump's shoulder, surprising him.'']

'''Terra:''' Pardon me. Expelled? Is Fausty still playing more of his little games? No. [''approaches Eda''] Budding prodigies like Miss Clawthorne ''need'' to be nourished. I'll let him know I was quite impressed... with ''both'' of you. [''she walks away as Bump faints in shock'']

[''Cut to a few days later, at Hexside, in the cafeteria. Eda is carrying a lunch tray and wearing her letterman jacket. She is seen looking around for Lilith and gasps in happiness upon seeing her. She walks over to a bored Lilith.'']

'''Young Eda:''' Lily! I finally caught you. I never got to tell you about that weird training thing over the weekend.

'''Young Lilith:''' Uh-huh.

'''Young Eda:''' I was horrified. If I lost, I was gonna get expelled and then we wouldn't be able to-- [''Lilith's watch rings'']

'''Young Lilith:''' Ah, shoot! [''stands up and grabs her empty lunch tray''] Sorry, Edalyn, gotta go. E.C. study group is meeting. We can.. talk later?

'''Young Eda:''' Go. Go, go, go, don't be late. [''Lilith walks off'']

[''Eda is now looking bored and alone. She takes a sip of her Ghoul Aid drink and is disgusted by the taste'']

'''Young Eda:''' Blech! Ugh. [''An unknown student offers her an Apple Blood drink'']

'''Unknown student:''' Trade?

'''Young Eda:''' Huh? [''She looks up. To her surprise, the student is revealed to be Raine.''] Raine?! What are you doing here? Oh- oh no, your scholarship!

'''Young Raine:''' Don't worry. I wanted to transfer out of Epiderm anyway. And apparently, my parents always hated the cold on [[the Knee]]. So? [''shakes the Apple Blood drink for her to take'']

[''They swap drinks. Cut to a view of them outside the school's window.'']

'''Young Raine:''' Okay, Eda. Give me the run down on this place. [''tastes the Ghoul Aid drink and finds it disgusting''] Blech!

'''Young Eda:''' [''chuckles''] Oh, you'll love it. It's got all the secrets. And since Terra spoke to Principal Faust, I can get away with pretty much anything! [''tastes the Apple Blood drink''] Mm! I've never had Apple Blood before, this stuff is good! 

[S''he continues sipping it as Raine watches her lovingly. The flashback ends. Back in the present, Eda is looking up at the sky warmly'']

'''Eda:''' And after that, we were inseparable. 

[S''he turns to see her audience, all of which have fallen asleep on her lap. Eda grabs Luz's notebook, where she has drawn Eda and Raine themselves as teenagers. Under the drawing are the words, "NO! GETTING SLEEPY! MUST RESISS--" with a trail of pencil from it. Eda smiles at the drawing, then looks back at the sky'']

'''Eda:''' [''sighs''] Raine, you better be okay.

[''Cut to the Emperor's Castle. Raine is sitting on a ledge, looking into the distance when Terra interrupts them and they turn around.'']

'''Terra:''' Ah! There, you are sprout. [''she arrives holding Raine's drinking horn with tea in it''] You know, I was just heartbroken when I found out it was you, of all people, causing trouble for the covens. But look how well you're doing now.

'''Raine:''' [''groans''] I just wish these headaches would go away.

'''Terra:''' [''hands them the drinking horn''] Keep drinking your tea, and you'll forget all about the pain. 

[''Raine blows (and whistles) into the tea lightly, and they drink it. Terra is watching them with a look of satisfaction. After they finish, Raine hands her back the drinking horn.'']

'''Terra:''' Have a good night, Raine. [''she walks away'']

[''As soon as she disappears, Raine immediately stands up with a look of determination on their face. After cracking their neck bones, they knock on a brick on the wall beside them, and the brick slowly disappears as a small abomination with a golem on its head (reminiscent of [[Darius]]) appears and hands them a letter, which they open.'']

'''Raine:''' A [[Draining Spell|draining spell]]? This is worse than we thought. Any way to counter?

[''The abomination passes them a small note. It reads, "OWL LADY".'']

'''Raine:''' I told you, I'm not putting her in danger again. We'll figure something else out. 

[''They whistle into the letter as it slowly dissolves into ashes and the abomination retreats back inside the brick. Raine lets the wind carry the ashes as they look up into the sky with a hopeful expression on their face.'']

'''Raine:''' I'll keep you safe, Eda. I promise.

[''Open on [[Gus Porter|Gus]] sitting in the hallways of [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]], his head buried in his arms. [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] walks up to him.'']

'''Luz:''' Hey, Gus. You okay?

'''Gus:''' I-I messed up bad, Luz. [[Willow Park|Willow]] just needed help with this pixie problem, right? So I thought, oh, that I'll lure them away with an illusion. But then...

'''Luz:''' That angered the pixies, and they attacked Willow. I heard.

'''Gus:''' I moved up ''two'' grades. What's the point of being good at this if I can't do anything good with it?

'''Luz:''' It was an honest mistake. Besides, Willow's tough as nails. I'm sure you'll both be feeling better tomorrow.

[''Cut to Gus laying on the floor of his bedroom, presumably tomorrow.'']

'''Gus:''' [''groans''] 

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-'''

[''Camera shows off Gus's bedroom.'']

'''Crystal Ball:''' [''caws and beeps'']

[''The crystal ball shows a prerecorded message of King.'']

'''King:''' [''on recording''] I'm not reading this.

'''Gus:''' [''on recording, off screen''] Come on, King. Please?

'''King:''' Ugh, fine. [''clears throat''] Is that a six-footed pig or a floating appendage? Why, no! [''Gus, wearing a cape, hops on screen.'']  It's Gus the Illusion Master. Please leave a message.

[''The video turns to Willow, her arm in a cast.'']

'''Willow:''' [''on recording''] Hey, Gus. Thanks for sending me all those "Get well soon" illusions but, uh...

[''Three tiny illusions of Gus jump onto her shoulders and head.'']

'''Illusion Gus #1:''' Willow! How are you feeling? Do you have a fever?

'''Illusion Gus #2:''' Willow, you want me to sing for you? Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...

'''Illusion Gus #3:''' Willow, is this helping?

'''Willow:''' Can you please take them back?

'''Gus:''' [''groans'']

[''The crystal ball shuts off. Gus rolls onto his stomach and traces a spell circle, summoning his illusion to stand in front of him''.]

'''Illusion Gus #1:''' Where's Willow?

'''Illusion Gus #2:''' Why are we here?

'''Illusion Gus #3:'''  Did we do bad?

[''Gus blows the illusions away. Someone knocks on a door. Cut to Gus opening the front door to find Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' [''raises fists''] Gustopher! [''finger points''] Gusteban! [''leans on the doorframe''] Augustabeth! Any of those working for you?

'''Gus:''' You need my library card to visit [[Amity Blight|Amity]], don't you?

'''Luz:''' [''laughs self-consciously''] I haven't been doing a good job of hiding that, huh?

[''Gus shakes his head.'']

'''Luz:''' Well, I was also hoping to do a little bit of... research! Come on! [''drags Gus away'']

'''Gus:''' [''screams''] 

[''Cut to Luz and Gus walking through the streets of [[Bonesborough]].'']

'''Luz:''' So, [[Gwendolyn Clawthorne|Eda's mom]] told me I'm not the first [[human]] to have lived in Bonesborough. If that's true, there might be some info on how they got here in the library!

'''Gus:''' Yeah, okay. Looking through old newspapers is about all I'm good for anyway.

[''The two of them stop walking.'']

'''Luz:''' Spill it, Gustonimo. Are you okay?

'''Gus:''' I-I've just been thinking. What if it's time for me to explore different kinds of magic?

'''Luz:''' I'm all for trying new things, but what's wrong with illusions?

'''Gus:''' Illusions are just so...you know--

'''[[Slitherbeast]]:''' [''growling'']

'''[[Braxas]]:''' Yay! Huh?

'''[[Bria]]:''' Good work guys!

'''[[Gavin]]:''' Yeah!

'''[[Angmar]]:''' Alright!

'''Gus:''' [''gasps'']

'''[[Warden Wrath]]:''' [''picks up Braxas''] Son, are you okay?

'''Braxas:''' Yes, Daddy. Thank you, mysterious heroes!

'''Bria:''' Stay safe out there!

'''Gus:''' Wow! Just wow! Plants. Abomination. Construction. You guys took down that Slitherbeast like it was nothing.

'''Bria:''' Nah, it wasn't that easy.

'''Gavin:''' Yeah, looked like you had a real hard time out there.

'''Gus:''' You're [[Glandus High|Glandus]] students, right? I go to Hexside. Name's Gus.

'''Bria:''' Nice to meet ya. This is Angmar. Gavin.

'''Gavin:''' Hey!

'''Bria:''' And I'm--

'''[[Mattholomule]]:''' Bria! [''panting, running on screen''] I would've helped, but like, there was this other baby in danger. You probably couldn't see.

'''Gus:''' Mattholomule?

'''Mattholomule:''' Augustus? Back off, twerp! This operation is Glandus kids only.

'''Bria:''' Hey, Matty, it's all cool. Did you get the map?

'''Mattholomule:''' Yes! And I only had to endue 35 noogies from [[Steve|my older brother]].

'''Bria:''' Nice work!

'''Gus:''' Well, uh, I can see you guys are busy, so--

'''Bria:''' Wait. Have you ever heard of the [[Galdorstone|Galdorstones]]?

'''Gavin:''' They're powerful relics. Many witches and demons have sought them.

'''Angmar:''' But they've all returned empty-handed, haunted by its guardian. Until us!

'''Bria:''' We heard some coven scouts talking about them, but it'll be rough going. You said you are a Hexside student, right? We could use the extra strength.

'''Gus:''' That sounds awesome, but I can't. I promised a friend I'd help her with something today.

[''On cue, Luz turns visible between everyone, surprising them.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps'']

'''All:''' Whoa!

'''Luz:''' [''pants''] Gus, you ran away so fast, but I didn't wanna interrupt so...I think you should go.

'''Mattholomule:''' Well, he can't. Gus is just an illusionist. He'll only hold us back.

'''Luz:''' Hah! Shows what you know. Gus here is a regular super witch.

'''Gus:''' Luz! [''drags her to the side''] I see what you're doing and it's really sweet, but I don't actually know any spells besides illusions.

'''Luz:''' No problem. [''hands him some spell glyphs''] Come on, man. You know I'm all about proving jerks wrong.

'''Gus:''' Alright. I'm in. Where do we find these Galdorstones?

'''Bria:''' We're journeying to the [[Looking Glass Ruins]] in the Forearm Forest!

'''Mattholomule:''' What's wrong, Augustus? Scared?

'''Bria:''' We all are. Who knows what awaits us out there? But we all got each other's back, right?

'''Gus:''' Yeah, um-Yeah. Yeah, alright, let's go!

'''All:''' Woo!

'''Mattholomule:''' [''sarcastically''] Woo. 

[''Cut to the [[Bonesborough Library]]. Luz is at a desk with a crystal ball.'']

'''Hexside Student:''' [''laughs''] Did you check out the other volume?

[''Luz types "human" into the crystal ball's search bar. She finds an article about Eda using paddleballs that were mistaken for weapons.'']

'''Luz:''' "Mystery vendor floods market with dangerous human goods." Oh, Eda. "Human resident donates personal diary to library." [''gasps''] Yes! This must be it!

[''Cut to the Kid's Corner. Luz peeks in, watching Amity, her hair down, talk to one of the baby class kids, who is holding her hairband captive.''] 

'''Amity:''' Come on. Give it back.

'''Baby Class Kid:''' No!

'''Amity:''' [''sighs''] If you give me back my hairband, I'll read you whatever book you want tomorrow.

'''Baby Class Kid:''' [''gasps, hands the hairband back''] Finally! I can learn how to summon the dark lord!

[''Amity stands and ties her hair up. Luz looks at her in complete adoration.'']

'''[[Edric Blight|Edric]] and [[Emira Blight|Emira]]:''' Hey, Luz.

'''Luz:''' Oh! [''chuckles''] Hey, Ed. Hey, Em. Picking up Amity?

'''Emira:''' Nah, looks like you got that covered.

'''Edric:''' I'm looking for skincare tips. I have a date tonight.

'''Emira:''' Yeah, he needs all the help he can get, after he accidentally texted a poem to their mom.

'''Edric:''' Please don't tell people that.

'''Amity:''' [''walking up to them''] Are they bothering you again?

'''Luz:''' Oh! [''steadily blushing''] No, I just came here to see you, and, uh, here you are. [''chuckles''] 

[''Amity is also blushing, and neither of them can look at the other''.]

'''Edric and Emira:''' [''gasp, put two and two together and share a smile'']

'''Emira:''' Edric, your face, it's exploding with horrific pustules!

'''Edric:''' Oh, no. [''genuinely worried''] Wait. Is it really?

'''Emira:''' We have to fix it before your date or you'll get dumped!

'''Edric:''' What? I will?

'''Emira:''' [''annoyed''] Come on, Ed.

[''Emira drags him away. Luz looks at Amity''.]

'''Luz:''' I was actually wondering if you could help me find this book? [''hands her a notebook''] Hundreds of years ago, there was a human named [[Emperor Belos|Philip Wittebane]] living in Bonesborough. And he donated his diary to this library.

'''Amity:''' And this might tell you how to travel between realms, right?

'''Luz:''' Yes! My mom probably thinks I'm missing right now. I have to get back to her as soon as possible.

'''Amity:''' Well, something this old would be kept in... the Forbidden Stacks.

[''Cut to the two of them standing in front of towering doors reading "The Forbidden Stacks." An echo mouse runs past the girls and under the door''.]

'''Echo Mouse:''' [''squeaks'']

'''Luz:''' Ah!

'''Amity:''' Only [[Malphas]], the master librarian, is allowed in here.

'''Luz:''' No te preocupes. Todo va a salir bien. Like my mom always said. [''chuckles, looks away''] I'm sure I can find another way.

'''Amity:''' Hey, wait. I never said I wasn't gonna help. My staff card should be able to open those doors. But once we're inside, you have to listen to everything I say. If we're caught, I could lose my job.

'''Luz:''' [''grabs Amity's hand in both of hers''] You won't lose your job. I promise.

[''They both look at their hands and blush. Luz immediately retracts her hands as Amity turns around.'']

'''Amity:''' Well, let's not waste any time.

[''She uses her card to open the door and sharing looks of determination, they head in as the doors close behind them.'']

[''Cut to a forest, where the Glandus kids and Gus are walking''.]

'''Bria:''' This will be a breeze once we get the Galdorstones.

'''Gus:''' What can the Galdorstones actually do?

'''Mattholomule:''' If you're holding one, every spell you cast gets a big power boost!

'''Angmar:''' I can grow an entire forest, and make my own butterfly sanctuary!

'''Gavin:''' I can create the biggest Abomination ever! [''bitterly''] I bet Dad will pay attention to that.

'''Gus:''' Whoa.

'''Mattholomule:''' Sorry. Doesn't do squat for illusions. Can't enhance what's not actually there.

'''Gus:''' Pfft. I know that.

'''Bria:''' Hold up, guys. We've come to our first challenge.

[''Their path is blocked by thick brambles''.]

'''Mattholomule:''' Show us what you got, Augustus. What did the human call you? "A super witch"? [''chuckles'']

'''Bria:''' [''gasps''] That's a great idea! Go on, Gus. I know you can do it.

'''Gus:''' [''pulls a glyph out from under his collar; groans''] Which one is this? [''draws spell circle''] Fireball!

[''It is indeed a fire glyph. A massive fireball clears their path''.]

'''Bria:''' Wow, Gus!

'''All:''' Woo-hoo!

'''Bria:''' I knew it was a good idea to bring you!

'''Mattholomule:''' I don't know what's going on, but I've got my eyes on you.

[''Cut to the library''.]

'''Luz:''' How much further do we have to go?

'''Amity:''' Actually, we're here.

'''Luz:''' Whoa. Let's get lookin'.

'''Amity:''' [''gasps, pulls Luz down''] Wait.

[''Malphas enters from a doorway. Luz and Amity realize how close they are to each other and roll away, blushing.'']

'''Luz:''' So, we'll be super sneaky and quiet. Got it.

'''Amity:''' Malphas is actually the one who gave me my job and my own study room. He's usually nice, but if we're caught, he'd feed us to the book worms.

'''Luz:''' I know here that probably means unholy, blood-sucking snake monster, but in the [[Human Realm]], that's just a cute name for nerds.

'''Amity:''' [''still blushing''] Huh. The human world sounds odd.

'''Luz:''' Maybe it would be less odd if I showed you around someday. But, uh, let's turn back. I don't wanna push you.

'''Amity:''' We're getting that diary. [''drags Luz deeper into the library'']

'''Luz:''' Wooh!

[''Cut back to the forest''.]

'''Mattholomule:''' According to the map, we should be getting close. [''screams as a snake drags him by the ankles into a tree'']

'''Gus:''' Don't worry, Matty. I got ya. [''uses plant glyph'']

'''Mattholomule:''' Hey! Only Bria can call me-- [''screams, face plants on the ground'']

[''Gavin and Angmar pick Mattholomule up by the arms and drag him off.'']

'''Gavin:''' Come on, dude.

'''Angmar:''' I'm not surprised he couldn't handle Glandus.

'''Gus:''' What did they mean by "couldn't handle Glandus"?

'''Bria:''' Things work differently at Glandus. Weak students are pushed around by the strong. But if I had a Galdorstone, I might be able to change things for the better.

'''Angmar:''' Hey! Over here!

'''Bria:''' [''gasps''] Okay, Angmar, you're on lookout duty. Angmar!

'''Angmar:''' Hmm?

'''Bria:''' I said you're on lookout duty. And if I catch you playing with anymore bugs, I'll make you eat them! Okay?

'''Angmar:''' [''whimpers'']

'''Bria:''' I believe in you!

'''Mattholomule:''' I can't believe we found it.

'''Bria:''' [''gasps; uses magic to get a Galdorstone and cracks a statue in the process''] Oh. Whoops. Well, we did it everyone. The power of the Galdorstones is ours! [''squeals''] I can't believe it. The legends were true! Woo-hoo!

[''As Bria, Gavin, and Mattholomule go around stealing the Galdorstones, Gus moves aside the plants covering the bases of the statues.'']

'''Gus:''' Huh. "The Phantom Bringer." "Aleth the Vision Creator"? "Khari the Mirage Maker." But these titles are for-- [''gasps''] Oh no. Stop! These aren't ruins. This is an illusionist graveyard.

'''Mattholomule:''' [''drops the Galdorstone he's holding''] Ew!

'''Bria:''' [''giggles''] Aw, Gus, you're saying that as if it's a bad thing.

'''Gus:''' What? Of course it is. These stones were theirs. We shouldn't take them.

'''Bria:''' Even if these witches were alive, what would illusionists use Galdorstones for? High-def party tricks? Come on, Gus. Don't you wanna power up those cool spells of yours?

'''Gus:''' No. This isn't right. I won't let you steal these.

'''Bria:''' I don't think you know what you're saying, Gus.

'''Angmar:''' [''runs in''] It's real! The guardian is real! And it's coming this way!

'''All:''' [''screaming'']

'''Guardian:''' [''roars'']

'''Angmar:''' I heard it has the power to control weather.

'''Gavin:''' And summon ghosts.

'''Bria:''' Well, I wonder if it can handle a little fire.

[''She shoves Gus into the open. He reaches for a glyph, and then pats himself down.'']

'''Gus:''' I'm all out of glyphs! [''gasps'']

[''Cut to the library, where Luz and Amity are pulling books off of shelves in hopes to find Philip's diary.'']

'''Echo Mouse:''' [''squeaking'']

'''Amity:''' Hmm?

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] [''pulls out Philip's diary, squeals'']

'''Both:''' [''ggigle''] Shh, shh, shh.

[''Luz opens the diary. An echo mouse is sitting in the pages, having eaten nearly all of them.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] You little rat! [''"rat"'' ''echoes''] Oh, no.

'''Malphas:''' Amity?

[''Cut to the steps of the library, the girls standing before Malphas who isn't as intimidating as he appeared.'']

'''Malphas:''' I'm just like super disappointed in you. Like, I can't even process these feelings right now. Gosh, it's so hard for me to say this, but like, you're fired.

[''Amity tenses as Malphas magically takes her employee ID. The doors close heavily. Luz and Amity stare at them''.]

'''Luz:''' Amity, I am so--

'''Amity:''' Not right now, Luz. [''tearing up''] Everything's changed since you came here. Being around you, it makes me do stupid things and I wish it didn't. [''gasps'']

'''Luz:''' [''also tearing up, nearly crying''] It's okay. I, uh-- [''sniffles''] I do stupid things around you too, Amity.

'''Amity:''' [''gasps''] I think I need to go home. [''leaves'']

'''Luz:''' [''cries, takes breath and slicks hair back''] Nada funcionar a menos que lo haga funcionar.

[''She squares her shoulders and walks back into the library. Cut to the Looking Glass Ruins''.]

'''Guardian:''' [''roars'']

'''Gus:''' [''being knocked over''] Whoa-!!

'''Guardian:''' [''roars'']

'''Gus:''' Uh, It'll just be an illusion, but maybe I can scare him away.

'''Illusion Guardian:''' [''roars and then poofs'']

'''Keeper:''' Oh-ho! I am the keeper of the Looking Glass Graveyard, and it has been a very long time since I've had a visitor! And to think it'd be another illusionist! Hehehehehe, though I don't remember them being so small.

[''Gus gives him a face.'']

'''Keeper:''' Don't give me that face, an illusionist has always kept watch over the Galdorstones, We gain no powers from them, so we're the least likely to use them for evil. Probably.

'''Gus:''' Well, we gotta get out of here. Now.

'''Bria:''' So, the big bag guardian is just another useless illusionist. Hehehe, today just keeps getting better.

[''Cut to black. Resumes on the Keeper and Gus making various noises while being trapped by an abomination and some vines.'']

'''Bria:''' [''getting some Galdorstones''] Got it! Whoops.

'''Angmar and Gavin:''' Oh!

'''Mattholomule:''' [''picking up a Galderstone''] Huh. Hey!!!

'''Bria:''' You're playing by Glandus rules, Matty. You can have anything you want if you're strong enough to take it.

'''Bria, Gavin and Angmar:''' [''laughing'']

'''Mattholomule:''' [''to Gus''] Hey. I-I didn't know she was gonna do this.

'''Bria:''' [''offscreen''] Matty, we need you to hold our stuff!

'''Mattholomule:''' This is exactly how it was at Glandus. Always Bria's stooge.

'''Gus:''' Better a stooge than a clown. Bria was right, illusions are nothing but high-def party tricks.

'''Mattholomule:''' Yeah, I used to think that too. [''He makes a saw of rock to cut the vines trapping Gus and The Keeper.''] But then I met some dork who used his powers to save me from a man-eating detention pit. All I'm saying is, if a dumb illusion can save a jerk like me, maybe it's not as useless as you think.

'''Gus:''' Thanks, Mattholomule. It's time to teach those jerks a lesson!

'''Keeper:''' I agree. I'll call the hounds.

'''Mattholomule:''' [''slightly unsettled''] Whoa.

'''Gus:''' With all due respect, sir, I'd like to try something a little more... creative.

'''Angmar:''' Intercepted!

[''A statue crumbles due to Angmar throwing himself straight at it.'']

'''Bria, Gavin, and Angmar:''' [''laughing'']

'''Angmar:''' [''notices a pink butterfly-looking creature''] Huh?

'''Bria:''' Maybe we can sell the small ones to the [[Emperor's Coven]], and keep the rest for ourselves! Angmar, start collecting! ...Angmar?

[''Angmar is off following the butterfly.'']

'''Bria:''' Hey! Get back here!

'''Butterfly:''' tehehehe, wink. [''continues giggling as it flies off into the fog'']

'''Angmar:''' [''following it''] Wait- come back! What species are you?

'''Bria:''' Ugh, whatever. I never really liked him anyway. Looks like you're my second in command, Gav-

'''Gavin:''' D-Dad?

[''A clone of Gavin with a big mustache appears from the fog.'']

'''"Gavin's Dad":''' Gavin, I just want you to know that I'm proud of you. Now, how about we go get some ice cream, son?

'''Gavin:''' Huh! That sounds great, Pops! Wait, when did you grow a mustache?

'''"Gavin's Dad":''' Hey! Don't blow this chance.

[''Gavin and his "dad" walk off into the fog together.'']

'''Bria:''' Come out, illusionist! I'm not dumb enough to fall for these tricks.

[''The world around her turns black, a shadowy figure in the shape of Gus runs across the screen.'']

'''Bria:''' Rghhaah!!! [''makes a pillar from the ground, breaking the illusion''] That's right. Who's strong now!? I never needed those losers anyway. [''picks up the bag of Galdorstones''] oofh- More for me.

[''The graveyard's statues turn to face her. Their eyes and mouths are bleeding, there's a statue around her size dragging itself to her from the ground.'']

'''Bria:''' Haha, cute. [''draws spell circle, which does nothing''] Huh? [''tries again''] Why isn't my magic working?!

[''She yelps as her hands seem to turn to stone and break off. The statue on the ground is getting closer and closer as she backs away.'']

'''Bria:''' [''panicking''] What's going on? No, no. This is all just an illusion. Hahah, it can't actually hurt me. It can't even touch me!

[''It touches her.'']

'''Bria:''' [''gasps''] 

[''The statue looks at her, its face matching her own. Blood pours from the statue's eyes.'']

'''Bria:''' AAH! Cursed! This place is cursed! [''runs off, screaming'']

''[The illusion that was set over the entire graveyard ends, revealing a slightly tired looking Gus where the moving statue was.]''

'''Gus:''' Man, that took a lot of concentration.

[''The illusons disappears, revealing several rock pillars Bria had conjured. Mattholomule and the Keeper come out of hiding.'']

'''Keeper:''' Laying an illusion over the whole graveyard to make it seem like the stones weren't working, very clever. Keeping honing your powers of observation, child, and there's no limit to what you'll be able to do.

'''Gus:''' There are some limits. I wish I could repair all the damage they did.

'''Mattholomule:''' Um... maybe I can help?

[''A bird chirps, standing on a statue. They've been repaired, though not nearly to their former glory.'']

'''Keeper:''' Thank you for defending the Looking Glass Graveyard, witchlings. Perhaps it's time I hid this place for good.

'''Gus:''' But- there's so much history here!

'''Mattholomule:''' What if we came over on the weekend to help build your defenses?

'''Keeper:''' I would like that very much. You're both welcome to come whenever you please. [''he makes finger guns and leaves'']

'''Mattholomule:''' He is definitely a ghost.

'''Gus:''' So, does that mean we're like... friends now?

'''Mattholomule:''' I... don't know.

[''They both start leaving the graveyard.'']

'''Mattholomule:''' [''playfully shoves Gus''] Squirt. Heheh

'''Gus:''' [''playfully shoves back''] Jerk. Hehahah

[''Fade to Amity's room, where Edric is admiring himself in the mirror while Emira brushes Amity's hair.'']

'''Amity:''' Ever since Luz came here, things have just gotten confusing. I'm thinking things I've never thought before. I'm feeling things I never used to feel!

'''Emira:''' Is that so bad? You weren't happy before- Ed, don't pick, You'll make it worse.

'''Edric:''' Too late.

'''Amity:''' [''sigh'']

'''Emira:''' Hey, your roots are growing out. Do you wanna dye your hair again?

[''Emira holds up a bottle of green hair dye. Amity grabs a strand of her hair contemplatively.'']

[''Cut to a short time later. Luz is walking up to the front door of Blight Manor. Amity, with only the top of the back of head showing, revealing her hair to now be lavender, looks at her siblings, Emira holding a pair of scissors.'']

'''Amity:''' So, how's it look?

'''Edric:''' Looks like you're about to get in big trouble with Mom. [''Emira lightly hits him''] Ow.

'''Emira:''' I think it looks great. But, yeah, maybe don't tell her I helped. [''hides the scissors behind her back'']

[''Knocking comes from the door. Amity opens it. Luz is there with Amity's staff card and looks very disheveled.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm sorry about everything! I understand if you never wanna see me again. Uh-- 

[''She and the camera fully see Amity's new hair for the first time: it's lavender, she no longer has it tied up and has bangs.'']

'''Luz:''' It's different.

'''Amity:''' Oh yeah. Mom always liked it green. I thought I could use a change... u-uh, [''takes employee ID''] how'd you get this back? And, what happened?

'''Luz:''' [''shakes a vine off her arm''] Well, to convince Malphas to hire you again, I had to go through some trials. And categorize some man-eating books- and, tame something called a paper dragon? That guy was not fun. [''notices Edric and Emira''] Oh, hey, guys.

'''Amity:''' Hm? 

[''She turns around. The twins duck around the corner. Amity sighs and goes outside, closing the door behind her.'']

'''Amity:'''  Oh- looks like you made a new friend.

'''Luz:''' Agh- [''shakes leg, getting the echo mouse on her leg to scurry off of it''] You're the one who ate the diary! Uaagh!! [''jumps after it, catching it but landing on her face''] I hate you.

'''Amity:''' [''giggles''] Wait, This is an echo mouse. It consumes knowledge through writing and can play back anything it eats. We dealt with them a lot at work. Watch.

[''Amity rubs its head a bit. The echo mouse's eyes eyes light up as it projects illustrations onto the front door.'']

'''Philip Wittebane:''' [''voiceover''] My journey through the Demon Realm is far from over. But today I humbly donate my journal to the ages. Entry one: May 21st... I think. My name is Philip Wittebane, and I found myself in a world so horrid, yet so fantastic, few minds could have dreamt it. If only those at home could see what I have, and perhaps they shall. For the more I learn about this realm, the more I am certain I can harness its strange powers to return home. Today I begin recording my journey to create a portal back to the Human Realm.

[''The projection stops. Luz holds up the echo mouse.'']

'''Luz:''' Thank you, little mouse. I hope you and I can become good friends.

[''Luz boops the mouse's nose with her own. The wind gently blows her hair around. Amity stares between Luz and the damaged ID in her hand. She smiles.'']

'''Amity:''' Don't worry, you always have a way of sneaking into people's hearts.

[''She kisses Luz on the cheek. Both of them look surprised by what she did.'']

'''Edric:''' [''from an open window with Emira''] Bold move, sister.

[''Luz and Amity make eye contact, both gasping softly. Amity blushes furiously and steps away.'']

'''Amity:''' Uh- okay- good to see you! Farewell forever. [''walks inside, muttering to herself:''] Why did I do that? Why'd I do that? Why did I do that?

[''Luz stands there for a second before collapsing to her knees, still facing where Amity once was.'']

[''The scene opens with an exterior shot of [[Luz Noceda|Luz's]] [[Noceda residence|home]] in the [[Human Realm|human realm]]. A white car passes by. Scene then cuts to Luz's room. The shot is focused on Luz's table. On the table we see a laptop, a few books, a pair of tinted glasses and an animal hat. The scene changes again and we see Luz's bunk bed with stuffed animals on it. A ''[[The Good Witch Azura|Good Witch Azura]]'' hat is seen on the floor and behind it, we can see a bookshelf. The scene changes again and we can see a tin foil swan, an [[Azura]] action figure and a dragon action figure. Someone is shoving all of items to the left. A photo frame with a picture of a younger Luz with long hair and a missing front tooth is seen. In the picture, she is holding an Azura action figure on her right hand and a ''Good Witch Azura'' book with her left arm. The [[Vee|person]] moving the items stops to look at the picture, and then shoves into a box along with the action figures.''

'''"Luz":''' [''stretches''] Ah, much better.

[''"Luz" lifts up the box, then stops to look at her reflection in the mirror. She smiles at it.'']

'''"Luz":''' Hmm.

[''Scene cuts to exterior of the house. [[Camila Noceda|Camila]] is seen standing beside her car and "Luz" is walking down the steps.'']

'''Camila:''' [''closes car door''] What's the box for, ''mija''? [''walks towards "Luz"'']

'''"Luz":''' Just cleaning up a little. [''smiles and looks down at the box'']

'''Camila:''' Even this? [''picks up the tin foil swan''] You used to love making me tinfoil swans!

'''"Luz":''' Oh, I'm uh [''takes back the tin foil swan''] just looking for a fresh start!

[''Camila looks at Luz walking towards the trash can with a slightly weirded out expression on her face.'']

'''"Luz":''' [[Reality Check Summer Camp|Camp]] taught me a lot, you know? [''sets down box beside the trash can'']

'''Camila:''' [''looks at "Luz" strangely''] Yes, it sure did

[''The sound of a rabbit squeaking is heard. Camila gasps. Scene cuts to a rabbit being caught in a trap.'']

'''Camila:''' Ah! Luz, grab the pliers!

[''"Luz" runs away. Camila puts on a pair of latex gloves.'']

'''Camila:''' [''kneels down''] Okay okay, little bunny, you're gonna be alright. [''cuts the string''] There we go!

[''The rabbit hops away.'']

'''"Luz":''' That's the 5<sup>th</sup> trap this week!

'''Camila:''' If I ever catches who's responsible and then I'll PA-POW!

[''"Luz" giggles.'']

'''Camila:''' Let's go back inside. [''boops "Luz"'s nose''] I will make maduros.

[''Scene cuts back to inside the house. "Luz" stops to talk to her reflection in the mirror.'']

'''"Luz":''' [''smiles''] A new life. [''"Luz" opens the cupboard to take out a shirt, then closes it. The reflection changes into the real Luz looking at "Luz" with an angry expression.'']

'''Luz:''' You! [''slams her hands on the mirror'']

[''"Luz" screams.'']

'''-[[The Owl House Main Theme|THEME SONG]]-'''

[''The scene shows the exterior of the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]]. [[King]], [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[Hooty]] is looking at Luz. Luz and King are in front of a makeshift [[portal]] door.'']

'''Luz:''' So, according to [[Emperor Belos|Philip's]] instructions, the hardest part to making a portal was finding someone who knew how to build it. [''puts something on the door''] But a lot of the ingredients are pretty easy to find. [''turns to look at Eda''] Your crazy apocalypse supplies finally came in handy Eda!

[''Eda snaps her finger, points at Luz and winks.'']

'''King:''' Don't forget this. [''looks at Luz with a sad expression and hands her [[Amity Blight|Amity's]] glove stained with [[Titan's Blood|Titan blood]].'']

'''Luz:''' [''stands up''] Titan blood. I can't believe something this powerful was in the old key this whole time.

[''King turns to look at Eda. The duo and Hooty all have a sad expression on their faces.'']

'''Luz:''' It's okay. If Belos is still trying to get to the human realm, he'll have to beat me to it!

[''Luz tears a piece of cloth off the glove, and then sticks it on the door. She then takes a few steps backwards. Scene cuts to Eda on her makeshift flying bathtub.'']

'''Eda:''' Are you sure this isn't gonna like, blow our faces off?

'''Luz:''' Nope!

'''Eda:''' Well, here goes something.

[''Eda starts pedaling. The rotors start transferring kinetic energy to the various components of the door. Luz looks at the door in amazement. The pieces of the door then merges together to form a crooked portal door. The door opens, revealing not the human realm but a separate, surreal [[In Between Realm|dimension]].'']

'''Luz:''' It worked! [''runs toward the door'']

'''King:''' Did it? That looks real different from the old door!

'''Luz:''' Yeah. [''takes over her cloak from Eda''] But this is my one chance to see my mom. [''Ties a rope on her waist''] If it looks like it's closing, pull!

'''Eda:''' Luz, as impressive as this is, I don't want you getting hurt.

'''Luz:''' Once I make sure my mom is okay, I'll be right back.

'''Eda:''' Just be careful. The human realm's filled with some real weirdos. [''winks at Luz'']

[''Luz hugs Eda, King and Hooty tightly.'']

'''Luz:''' Mmm!

'''King:''' Don't forget to mention me!

'''Luz:''' Okay.

[''Luz puts King down and walks toward the door, She stops in front of it, stares into the dimension, then jumps into it.'']

[''The screen flashes then cuts to Luz floating up from a pool of water. Luz gasps, gets up and starts coughing. A strange cube-like object appears from the water and starts floating upwards. Luz watches this and gasps. Scene zooms out and it is shown that there are multiple similar cubes floating around above.'']

'''Luz:''' Did I do something wrong? [''shouts''] Eda? King? Hooty? [''more cubes appear''] Can anyone hear me?

[''A cube appears. It starts flashing and making a sound, grabbing Luz's attention. She walks over and holds it in her hands. The cube starts shining brightly and the scene turns white. When it's gone, Luz finds herself inside one of the Owl House's window as a reflection.'']

'''Luz:''' Am I back at the Owl House?

[''Wind blows past, pushing open the window, scaring Luz.'']

'''Luz:''' Whoa! Whoa, I think I'm in the reflection! [''taps on the window'']

[''Luz then notices Eda, King and Hooty. Camera zooms out to the trio standing in front of the makeshift portal door.'']

'''King:''' Do you think she's safe?

'''Eda:''' She's made it this far, we just have to trust her.

[''Scene zoom in on Luz. The window flashes, then Luz disappears. Scene cuts back to the cube Luz is holding. It starts dimming and returns back to it's galaxy like form. Luz releases the cube and gasps.'']

'''Luz:''' I wonder if I can see Amity! [''blushes'']

[''A cube floats up as soon as Luz finishes speaking.'']

'''Luz:''' Ah! Ugh! No no no! [''pushes the cube down back into the water''] Come on Luz, you're on a mission! [''squeezes in between her nose''] Camila! Camila Noceda of the human realm?

[''Luz looks up and notices a cube flashing.'']

'''Luz:''' Got ya! [[Ice Glyph|Ice platform]]!

[''Luz slaps a piece of paper with ice glyph on it but it doesn't work.'']

'''Luz:''' [''angrily''] Fine then! I'll do this the hard way!

[''Luz jumps onto a cube floating upwards. The dimension suddenly rotates, causing Luz to fall down. The cube she was reaching for is now right in front of her. Luz reaches for it.'']

'''Luz:''' Mom!

[''Scene cuts to Luz's house. Luz is a reflection inside her mom's cellphone.'']

'''Luz:''' [''gasps''] It's my house!

[''Camera moves to the right. Camila is seen dancing to the music while opening the fridge to take something, then closes it.'']

'''Luz:''' Mom!

[''Camila continues dancing while humming.'']

'''Camila:''' Oh yeah.

[''Camila takes a hand of bananas from the counter. A family picture is shown and we see a younger Luz, Camila and an unknown male whose face is obscured by reflection.'']

'''Luz:''' [''tears rolling down cheeks''] Mo-

'''"Luz":''' Mom? Do you need any help?

[''Luz gasps, shocked by what she's seeing.'']

'''Camila:''' Oh, are you done cleaning your room?

'''"Luz":''' Almost! With all that old stuff gone, I feel like a whole new person.

'''Luz:''' [''shocked''] Evil doppelgnger! Mom! Mom! [''knocks on cellphone's glass''] Mom! Mom!

'''Camila:''' I can finish up here, ''mija''.

'''"Luz":''' Thanks, Mom! [''runs off to her room'']

[''The cube flashes and stop showing.'']

'''Luz:''' Follow her! Luz Noceda 2.0! Doppelgnger! Why won't you work?! [''exasperated sigh''] Okay Luz, calm down. Just breathe and count to 5.

[''Water sloshing sound, a cube floats up, Luz notices it. The cube's screen changes, Luz walks towards it.'']

'''"Luz":''' A new life. [''closes cupboard door, notices real Luz in the reflection'']

'''Luz:''' [''angrily''] You!

[''Scene cuts to Camila cooking something. She hears "Luz" screaming. Scene cuts back to Luz's room again.'']

'''Luz:''' So you can hear me.

'''"Luz":''' [''scared''] You're from the demon realm.

'''Luz:''' Listen, I just wanna-

'''"Luz":''' [''blinks''] I'm not going back! I- I won't go back! [''picks up a red baseball bat and attempts to break the mirror'']

'''Camila:''' [''outside the door''] Luz? ''Est todo bien?''

'''"Luz":''' ''S, mama!'' I just saw a spoiler from ''Monster Slayer Academia''!

'''Camila:''' [''disappointed''] I'll never understand anime.

'''Luz:''' [''looks at "Luz" and shrugs''] Hmm?

[''"Luz" runs and jumps out the window.'']

'''Luz:''' Wait!

[''"Luz" lands, jumps over a fence, then runs into the house where Eda used to set as an exit for her portal to the human realm. The inside is littered with random stuff and old newspapers. Luz appears as a reflection in a small purse mirror.'']

'''"Luz":''' So this is it. I'm gonna have to run again. [''sad expression''] Why couldn't this just WORK OUT?!

[''"Luz" kicks a rock, it hits a trap mechanism and accidentally triggers it. A rope tightens around her foot and drags her backwards. "Luz" becomes scared and reveals her true form, a [[basilisk]]. She groans.'']

'''Luz:''' Stop moving! You'll make it tighter!

'''Basilisk:''' Huh?

'''Luz:''' I didn't mean to freak you out. I just want to figure out what's going on, okay? You're a demon from the Boiling Isles, aren't you?

'''Basilisk:''' Mm-hmm. [''reverses back to half human form'']

'''Luz:''' [''smiles''] What's your name?

'''Basilisk:''' I'm Number F I mean, I'm Vee.

'''Luz:''' Okay Vee, I'm gonna help free you. You're gonna be alright. Now, back up a bit, give the wire some slack. Now, look for a little metal thingamabobber. [''apologetically''] Sorry, I don't know what it's called.

[''Vee finds the metal object, then pulls the rope loose.'']

'''Luz:''' There you go, nice and easy.

'''Vee:''' Ah! [''pants''] Thank you. [''sobs''] You must be Camila's real daughter.

'''Luz:''' I am. But right now, I'm trapped in the [[Boiling Isles]]. Who are you, why are you pretending to be me?

'''Vee:''' I am just looking for a place to belong.

[''Luz stares at Vee with a weird expression.'']

'''Vee:''' You're missing and mom I mean, Camila seemed so kind, so I stayed with her but uh, I'll go if you-

'''Luz:''' Wait wait wait! Maybe we can help each other! Today I was gonna tell my mom where I've been, but because of you, she hasn't realized that I've been missing! So, keep living in my place! For now. When I get back, I can introduce her to the demon realm and help you find a place to live.

'''Vee:''' There's one problem. I need [[magic]] to transform and I uh just used the rest of it.

'''Luz:''' Hmm [''thinks while looks to Vee's left''] Oh! [''points''] That's where we can get some magic!

[''Vee picks up an old newspaper. The title reads "SECRETS OF [[Gravesfield|GRAVESFIELD]]" and at the bottom, "BY [[Jacob Hopkins|JACOB HOPKINS]]".'']

'''Vee:''' Secrets of Gravesfield?

'''Luz:''' No no, that's junk, turn it over.

[''Vee turns over the paper. The title reads "STRANGE WOMAN BANNED IMMEDIATELY FROM CAFE FOR CREATING LIVING BOOKS".'']

'''Vee:''' Strange woman banned from caf.

'''Luz:''' That's Eda, the Owl Lady, she's been coming here for years. She might have left some magic stuff behind!

'''Vee:''' Okay! [''picks up the mirror''] We can try.

[''Vee walks out the door. Camera pulls slightly up, and we see a functioning CCTV installed at one of the house corners recording the room.'']

[''Scene changes, showing a town sign which says "Welcome to GRAVESFIELD", "FOUNDED IN 1635". A crow is pecking on it. Vee walks by, and the crow flies away. Vee puts on a pair of tinted glasses. Scene changes again, showing statues of 2 people wearing clothing from the 1700s. 2 crows fly by, crowing. Camera pans to the right, showing the exterior of a caf called "ROBIN'S ROAST CAFE". There are people walking outside it.'']

'''Vee:''' Is this it? Huh I- I just go in and ask about that witch from the paper?

'''Luz:''' Yes. [''turns to look at the caf''] Maybe they still have one of her enchanted pastries! [''turns back''] Huh? [''points at her ears''] Ears! Ears!

[''Vee's ears accidentally comes out. She whimpers and quickly covers it with her animal hat. A kid notices that and points at it, but her mother drags her away.'']

[''Vee pushes open the glass door. A door bell chimes. Vee starts sniffing at something.'']

'''Shopkeeper:''' Hello!

[''Vee yelps and quickly covers her mouth. The shopkeeper hands over a drink to a customer and turns to Vee.'']

'''Shopkeeper:''' What can I get ya?

'''Vee:''' [''Walks towards counter''] Uh, have any um, magical old ladies left enchanted items here?

'''Shopkeeper:''' Ugh, you're not friends with that witch-obsessed guy, right? I told him to stop leaving pamphlets here!

'''Vee:''' [''frightened expression, looks up and points''] Actually I'm asking about her.

'''Shopkeeper:''' Oh, Marylin? 

[''Camera pans up, showing a sign which says "BANNED FOR LIFE" with pictures of some people on it, one of them is Eda holding a raccoon.'']  

'''Shopkeeper:''' Yeah, she tried to pay for a latte with a live raccoon a couple of months ago. But when I called the cops, she did something weird to the croissants. [''picks up a croissant with a pair of tongs''] We threw em in the trash but Well, [''sighs''] now we have a whole new problem.

[''Vee pushes open the back door of the caf, which leads to an alley, and starts sniffing around.'']

'''Vee:''' I don't smell any magic. [''hears hissing sound''] Huh?

[''2 talking rats with glowing red eyes emerge from behind 2 boxes.'']

'''Rats:''' Bread of wisdom grants us speech. We desire more!!!

'''Luz:''' Cool! Talking rats! Maybe they know something.

[''One of the rat hisses and pounces at Vee. Vee screams and runs away. She runs to a park and stops behind a statue, panting, then turns to look at the rats. They hiss then turn back into the alley.'']

'''Luz:''' Vee? Is everything alright?

'''Vee:''' Oh, [''laughs''] yeah, I- I just don't like confrontation. [''chuckles nervously'']

'''Luz:''' Oh! Well, that's okay, I'm sure there's someone else who's seen Eda. [''gasps''] There!

[''Vee turns around and sees 3 high schoolers hanging out together under a tree, laughing. Camera zooms in on one of the girl's hands and she's holding a deck of Hexes Hold'em card.'']

'''Luz:''' Hexes Hold'em cards! Eda got rid of all her decks. I was wondering where they went

'''Vee:''' [''sniffing''] Well, they must've run out of magic, I don't smell anything.

'''Luz:''' But maybe they know where to get more! Okay, we gotta be carfeful approaching high schoolers. Mark all your exit routes-

'''Vee:''' [''laughs''] Actually, these guys are cool. [''starts walking towards the high schoolers'']

'''Luz:''' Ah! Wait, hey!

[''Scene cuts back to the 3 high schoolers.'']

'''Girl 1:''' A past connection that left its mark on your soul has shown up again, and it's asking you to shed your old ways and enter a metamorphosis! Becoming a spiritual leader, you're meant to be.

'''Boy:''' Yeah, that sounds about right. [''scratches himself'']

[''Girl 1 puts the card on the grass. Vee stops in front of her and kneels down.'']

'''Vee:''' Hello!

[''Scene cuts to Luz in the Reflection Dimension.'']

'''Luz:''' [''panics''] Oh, she's gonna embarrass herself! [''covers her face''] I can't watch

'''Girl 1:''' [''sounds from cube''] Oh, Hey Luz! Good to see you outside of prison.

'''Vee:''' [''laughs''] Come on! Camp wasn't that bad.

'''Luz:''' Camp?

[''Scene cuts back to Vee and the high schoolers.'']

'''Vee:''' We did have the best cabin!

'''Vee and the high schoolers:''' CABIN 7! Hoo-ha-ha! [''laughing'']

'''Vee:''' Cool cards! Where'd you get 'em?

'''Girl 1:''' Uh-uh. Let me give you a reading first. I wanna practice.

[''Girl 1 lays down three cards on the ground. The first shows a crescent moon as the whitespace of an abstract sideways face. The second shows a skeleton with a golden chalice, and the third shows a fish with two Y-shaped arrows behind it.]''

[''Scene cuts again to Luz in the Reflection Dimension looking through the cube. She grabs and presses her nose up to it, perhaps intrigued.'']

'''High schoolers (excluding Girl 1):''' Woah.

[''Cut back to Vee and the high schoolers. Ominous music starts playing.'']

'''Girl 1:''' You're running from your past. From a previous life that was not kind to you. However, the guilt and fear you carry will eventually catch you in a self-fulfilling prophecy that you won't be able to escape from.

'''Vee:''' [''nervous noise'']

'''Girl 1:''' You're gonna need some bath bombs, girl.

[''Ominous music stops. Girl 1 picks up the cards.'']

'''Girl 1:''' Anyway, I got the cards over at the Gravesfield Historical Society.

'''Vee:''' [''dejectedly''] Thanks. I'll see you around.

[''Vee starts to walk over to the nearby [[Gravesfield Historical Society]]''.]

'''Girl 1:''' Did you see the look in her eyes? I gotta find out where she got those contacts.

[''Vee enters the Gravesfield Historical Society building. Cut to inside the reception desk. Vee sniffs, then quietly sneezes.'']

'''Jacob:''' Is it that dusty in here? Welcome to the Gravesfield Historical Society. Lemme guess, you're here to buy those weird cards, right?

'''Vee:''' How did you know?

'''Jacob:''' Well they've been really popular with high schoolers. Yeah, saw an old lady try to dump 'em in a river a while back, but I bought them off her instead. Was really odd though, she kept asking for snails.

[''Scene cuts again to Luz in the Reflection Dimension.'']

'''Luz:''' This is it!

[''Cut back to the Historical Cosiaty.'']

'''Jacob:''' You want a set?

'''Vee:''' Yes please!

'''Jacob:''' Well I'll be just a minute, so feel free to look around.

[''Jacob enters a door labelled STAFF. Vee chooses to walk into the Historical Society's museum and stand opposite a framed painting of a flag. Luz appears in the framed reflection.'']

'''Luz:''' Are you okay? Hey, forget what that girl said! I know what it's like to run away from home. I did the same thing.

'''Vee:''' You and I are not the same. You had a mom who loved you, a home, a life, you had it GOOD! And you STILL wanted to run away, I... I didn't have a choice. My real name is... Number 5. I'm a basilisk, and technically, I... I shouldn't exist.

[''Cut to a flashback with Vee in her true form behind cell bars. Each shot in this flashback is one frame per shot.'']

'''Vee:''' [''narrating''] My kind went extinct a long time ago, but we were brought back.

[''Shot of Vee sucking out magic, perhaps the soul, of a small rat. [[Warden Wrath]] stands behind Vee, writing down something on a clipboard. 2 [[Coven Scout]]s stand behind him.'']

'''Vee:''' They wanted to know how we drained magic.

[''Shot of many other basilisks trapped in these cells.'']

'''Luz:''' I met a basilisk once. She hurt a lot of people.

'''Vee:''' For many of us, all we knew how to do was feed.

[''Shot of Vee and a few other basilisks at a mountainside, Emperor Belos and a group of [[Coven Guard|Coven Guards]] are looking over a cliff.'']

'''Vee:''' Some of us escaped, but I knew it was only a matter of time before HE caught us again.

[''Shot of Vee at the back of Episode 1's "human collectibles" scene. Vee sneaks behind the tent and it is implied she goes through the door to the Human Realm.'']

'''Vee:''' That's when I saw you, and... and realised there might be a way out of this!

[''The flashback is now fully animated. A flash of yellow light emits from the abandoned house. Vee emerges from the abandoned house where the portal was set up. Camila walks in view of the house.'']

'''Camila:''' Luz? Where are you?

'''Vee:''' Eeh! [''transforms into a replica of Luz'']

'''Camila:''' Luz? There you are.

'''Vee (as Luz):''' [''nervously''] Hello... fellow human! Um... skin's sure weird!

'''Camila:''' Very funny. But, I was thinking, instead of taking the bus to camp, why don't we drive? I got the day off from work, and you'll have full control of the playlist.

'''Vee:''' [''narrating''] I didn't mean to keep playing this role, but... Camila was nice to me.

[''Flashback exits, return to museum. Vee is visibly upset.'']

'''Vee:''' I resent you for running away. But I'm also thankful that you did. I dunno. It's... confusing.

[''Vee sniffs something odd and stops the conversation.'']

'''Vee:''' Do you smell something?

[''Vee walks towards the room labelled STAFF. Luz disappears from the framed flag. The room is strangely pitch black.'']

'''Luz:''' Where's the light?

[''Vee locates a light switch and flicks it on. She gasps. Scene cuts to multiple weapons on display such as a sword, drill and an axe. Scene cuts again and shows an old picture with the words "THE HUNTING OF A DANGEROUS WITCH" underneath it. Scene cuts again and shows a flashing toy witch on a guillotine with the words "YE OLDE WITCH". A few books can be seen beside the toy. Vee walks further into the room looking around. Scene changes again, showing a deck of glowing Hexes Hold'em cards. Camera pans up and shows a bulletin board with multiple pictures of Eda. The pictures are connected to each other using red strings.'']

'''Vee:''' What is all this?

[''Vee bumps into a computer, turning the desktop on and revealing several tabs of video footage of Vee and the abandoned house. She screams, and runs to exit the door, but steps on a laser grid and is caged, her front mirror breaks too, rendering Luz unable to see the scene. Cut to a distressed Luz in the Reflection Dimension.'']

'''Luz:''' [''increasingly panicked''] Vee? Vee? VEE?

[''Scene cuts to exterior shot of Gravesfield Historical Society. Dark clouds start rolling in and rumble of thunder can be heard.'']

[''Luz reappears in a reflection in a framed painting in the room.'']

'''Luz (in reflection):''' Vee!

'''Vee:''' [''stressed, revealing true form''] LET ME OUT!

[''Jacob enters the room apprehensively, holding a stick.'']

'''Jacob:''' Woah, it worked?

[''Luz hides, crouching further down the framed painting.'']

'''Jacob:''' I-I can't believe it, are you real? [''Vee slaps stick out of Jacob's hand''] After all that time, after setting up all those traps, I... I finally caught a living, breathing demon! Oh, don't be suprised. A few years back I had a chance encounter with another one of your kind. [''holds a photograph taken of Eda's owl-demon form'']

'''Jacob:''' Yeah, at first I couldn't BELIEVE what I saw, but after watching a few MewTube videos I learned the truth. Witches and demons are real...

[''Luz gasps through the reflection.'']

'''Jacob:''' ... and they're all sent from Mars to harvest human teeth to power their time machine!

[''Luz strikes an odd expression.'']

'''Vee:''' You... don't actually know anything about us, do you?

'''Jacob:''' Oh, I know enough. I'll EXPOSE your vile plans on MewTube and finally... get my account verified. Get comfortable, demon. Cause you'll be in cages for the rest of your life. [''exits room'']

'''Luz:''' Don't worry Vee, we can get out of this...

'''Vee:''' Go back to the demon realm, Luz.

'''Luz:''' Huh?

'''Vee:''' Even if I get out, he knows what my disguise looks like. He'd out me to Camila and it'd would cause her more trouble than if you just disappeared.

'''Luz:''' Vee! You're giving up too quick!

'''Vee:''' I'm being realistic. It's okay, I'm used to living like this. Goodbye, Luz.

'''Luz:''' NO!

[''Vee destroys the framed picture Luz is in with her tail. Back at the Reflection Dimension, the cube Luz was using breaks.'']

'''Luz:''' Vee! Five! Number 5! Agh! [''punches black water'']

'''Luz:''' [''pauses, now more confident''] Camila Noceda.

[''A cube emerges from the water. She accesses it and is transported to the reflection of Camila's phone. Camila can be seen with a box of various items from Vee's earlier packings. Camila is playing around with a tinfoil swan.'']

'''Camila:''' [''to tinfoil swan''] Boop.

'''Luz:''' Mom, are you there?

'''Camila:''' Huh? Luz? I didn't even hear you call!

'''Luz:''' Mom. It's go great to hear your voice.

'''Camila:''' Oh. It's great to hear you too? What's wrong?

'''Luz:''' I found out who's setting up those traps, and he's... hurting a friend of mine. But first... I have to tell you the truth. About the last few months. Let me tell you about a place called Boiling Isles.

[''Camila sits down to listen to Luz's story.'']

[''Fade to Camila's car arriving at the Gravesfield Historical Society building. It is shown to be dark outside.'']

'''Camila:''' You know, if you wanted me to pick you and your friend up, you didn't have to make up this elaborate story about the "demon realm".

'''Luz:''' I'm not making it up, Mom.

'''Camila:''' [''giggles''] Don't worry, I'll play along. [''enters building''] I know this stuff made school difficult, but I'm glad you're still being creative.

[''A flying pickaxe flies toward and hits a statue labelled "A WITCH" in the back. Pan right to reveal Jacob handling some boxes.''] 

'''Camila:''' Are you the curator here?

'''Jacob:''' Who's askin'?

'''Camila:''' A little 'birdie' told me you caught a demon! I would love to see it!

'''Jacob:''' Wait, how did you know? Do you work for the government?

'''Camila:''' Oh. I'm a veterinarian, actually.

'''Jacob:''' So, the President sent a vet to study the demon's anatomy, huh? Sure. But first, [''picks up a voice recorder''] I'll need verbal confirmation that I get to publish my findings first. [''voice recorder beeps'']

'''Camila:''' Uh... 'kay.

'''Jacob:''' Good. [''voice recorder beeps again''] Now you're bound by law. Follow me.

'''Camila:''' [''to Luz''] You even made me a part of your game! Ooh, This is so fun.

[''Camila and Jacob both enter the STAFF room. Vee's cage is covered up with a rug.'']

'''Camila:''' Ooh! Is this one of those escape rooms? Or, um, what do you call them, a LARP? Oh, sorry, don't want to break the illusion.

'''Jacob:''' Let me start by telling you the secret history of Gravesfield.

[''Jacob walks over to wall covered with notes held together conspiracy-theorist-style. He places his hand on Camila's shoulder, though Camila brushes it away. He opens up a book and flips to an old drawing of a burning bulding, possibly the building the Gravesfield Historical Society was built on.'']

'''Jacob:''' In the 1600s this was a peaceful colony. Until, tragedy struck.

[''Jacob flips the book to the next page to reveal a drawing of two Victorian-era dressed men, one of them shaking hands with a witch. All of their faces are somewhat rubbed out.'']

'''Jacob:''' Two brothers were lured into a realm of evil by a real witch, never to be seen again. [''closes book, turns to table''] People have stopped believing in the horrors of witchcraft, but... I know the TRUTH.

'''Camila:''' Woah. Luz, this is quite a detailed story.

'''Jacob:''' [''walking towards concealed cage''] But now I've got PROOF that otherworldly beings exist! BEHOLD!

[''Jacob pulls back the rug to reveal Vee in the cage with duct tape over her mouth.'']

'''Camila:''' [''alongside multiple shots of Vee's features''] Oh wow! That is a very... convincing... [''realization''] costume? [''loud gasp'']

'''Jacob:''' Costume? This is a real life DEMON! C'mere, watch this.

[''Jacob runs over to a series of four monitors, displaying a video where Vee transforms into her true form. The camera focuses on Camila for most of the shot, who is completely shocked by it.'']

'''Jacob:''' More vile beings will probably come to its rescue. But I can protect humanity. I even had some custom gear made at the renaissance faire. Usually I don't take it out for just anyone, but what the heck! If I'm gonna be working with the government, I might as well show off a little.

[''Jacob takes a hook and tries to get the suit of armor down. This serves as a distraction for him.'']

'''Camila:''' Luz, come on. I don't like this game anymore.

'''Luz:''' It's not a game, Mama. Everything I told you was true.

'''Camila:''' So that thing has been living with me the entire time? It's just a lot to believe...

'''Luz:''' Her name is Vee and she may look different but she's not bad, please, you gotta help her!

[''Camila turns to Vee and walks towards her. Vee braces in expectation that she would be hit, but Camila crouches to talk to Vee instead.'']

'''Camila:''' Hello... this is all so confusing, but... who knew I had such a strong girl living under my roof this whole time?

[''Vee is touched by that and starts to tear up, but is interrupted by Jacob wearing the suit of armor.]''

'''Jacob:''' So how do I look? Maybe we can collaborate on a version that can survive the battles on Mars? [''notices Camila's phone, gasps''] Wait, what is that? Are you recording this?

'''Camila:''' Uh...

'''Jacob:''' Wonderful! Well I was gonna wait until after the press tour, but let's begin our live dissection of this demon RIGHT NOW!

'''Camila:''' STOP! Uh, the... the President just called. Yeah, and, uh...  

[''Camila looks at her phone where Luz is signalling to her.'']  

'''Camila:''' Uh... Y'know what? I don't have the imagination for this. I will be taking this innocent child with me, and you will never bother us again. 

'''Jacob:''' What? No absolutely NOT! We made a VERBAL AGREEMENT-

'''Camila:''' Mister. [''brandishing an upside-down slingshot''] You better back the heck down, or I will tell the police you have been illegally setting up traps and cameras on private property! [''drops the slingshot'']

'''Jacob:''' I won't let you take away my discovery. I'm the good guy here!

'''Camila:''' Yeah. [''takes out a flip-flop from her handbag, aiming it square at Jacob''] A lot of bad guys say that.

[''Camila strikes at Jacob with the flip-flop. There is a presumed short timeskip. Cut to outside the building where it is currently raining. Camila and Vee are walking out of the building. Vee has a coat on.'']

'''Vee:''' Is it okay to leave him in there?

'''Camila:''' He'll be fine. 

[''Cut to the Gravesfield Historical Society building's STAFF room, where Jacob sits in Vee's former cage, unconscious.'']

'''Camila:''' He can use the time for some self-reflection.

[''Another presumed short timeskip, this time Camila and Vee both arrive at the Noceda home, exiting their car. Luz appears through the headlights of the car.'']

'''Luz:''' Heh! Look what I can do with the rain! Vee! I'm so happy you're okay!

[''Luz then attempts to high-five Vee, but Luz's hand phases through.'']

'''Luz:''' Woah.

'''Vee:''' Yeah. Thank you, Camila. For everything.

'''Camila:''' Vee. You have a place here for as long as you need. And take these. [''hands Vee a deck of Hexes Hold 'Em cards from her handbag''] Luz said they might be helpful for you.

'''Vee:''' Magic!

[''Vee starts eating a few of the cards, and walks away.'']

'''Luz:''' Mom, you were AWESOME back there! Thanks for being cool... about everything.

'''Camila:''' [''starting to cry''] I'm trying to hold it together... I really am... But I have never been this scared before. A demon realm? Magic? How are you gonna get back here? Is this the only way I can touch you?

[''Camila attempts to hold Luz's hand, but it just phases through again.'']

'''Luz:''' I... I need a little more time, but if I keep working my hardest I will make a working portal, I promise!

'''Camila:''' As scary as this is, it really does seem like you've matured.

'''Luz:''' Yes! I've learned so much... Staying here was the best decision I ever made.

'''Camila:''' You... [''getting angry''] chose to stay there?

'''Luz:''' Oh, uh...

'''Camila:''' Were you trying to live out some witch fantasy? Did you... did you hate living with me that much? [''turns to look at Luz with a hurt expression'']

'''Luz:''' Mama, no!

[''Luz is then dragged back up by the rope she is attached to. Cut back to the Reflection Dimension.'']

'''Luz:''' No. [''pulls herself down on the rope''] Not yet. Not... yet! MOM!

[''Luz drops the hovering cube. A wide shot of the Reflection Dimension reveals Camila's face on many of the cubes. Cut back to the human realm.'']

'''Luz:''' I'm being pulled back!

'''Camila:''' Baby? No, no no no no no... [''Luz is pulled back further''] When you come home, promise you'll stay here. I didn't mean to push you away. I swear things will be different.

'''Luz:''' [''starts tearing up''] Mom, it's not you, it never was!

'''Camila:''' Promise me, Luz... please!

'''Luz:''' [''sad expression''] Okay, mom. I promise. [''fades away from view''] 

'''Camila:''' [''cries'']

[''Cut back to Luz in the Reflection Dimension, who is being pulled back with a rope. The camera rotates as Luz is pulled back to the portal to the other side of the Reflection Dimension.'']

'''Luz:''' MOM! [''tears dripping from her eyes'']

[''She is pulled back further, splashing into the water. For a brief time, only her glowing outline remains before fading from the Reflection Dimension. Back at the Boiling Isles outside the Owl House, Eda, King, and Hooty are pulling back on the rope attached to the portal. The portal itself seems to be leaking some kind of black viscous liquid, perhaps the same kind of liquid that was shown in the Reflection Dimension.'']

'''Eda:''' And pull, and pull, and...

[''Luz arrives back at the Boiling Isles, flying out of the portal. Eda, King, and Hooty are all sent flying back too. They all land on each other.'']

'''King, Eda, Hooty:''' Luz! [''all get up'']

'''Eda:''' I'm sorry, I had to pull you out. The portal was closing.

[''Cut to the portal, which creaks, then folds in on itself in a ball, finally disappearing in a puff of smoke.'']

'''King:''' [''hops onto Luz's shoulder''] Did you talk to your mom? Did you mention me?

'''Luz:''' Yeah. Mama... Mom can't wait to meet you guys.

'''Eda:''' Well, just rest up now, okay? And don't you worry, kiddo. With everything we've learned, we'll have a real working portal in no time.

'''King:''' I can't wait to eat HUMAN snacks!

'''Hooty:''' [''from behind the others''] I can't wait to share parenting tips!

'''Eda:''' Who dubbed you a parent? [''all laugh, except for Luz'']

[''Luz looks towards a camera with a nervous look in her face. Fade to black.'']
