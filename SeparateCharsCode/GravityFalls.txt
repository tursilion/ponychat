|''The episode opens with a shot of the sun. [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] starts to narrate.''
|-
![[Dipper Pines|Dipper]]
|''(Narrating)'' Ah, summer break.
|-
!
|''The camera pans to [[Hank]] grilling burgers while [[Shmipper and Smabble]] are running around beside him. Others sit at a picnic table.''
|-
![[Hank]]
|So you want cheese on that, [[Hank's wife|hon]]?
|-
!Hank's wife
|Sure, Hank.
|-
!Dipper
|A time for leisure, recreation, and taking 'er easy.
|-
!
|''The camera stops at the "Welcome to [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]" sign.''
|-
!Dipper
|Unless you're me.
|-
!
|''[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] and Dipper Pines crash through the "Welcome to Gravity Falls" sign with the [[Mystery Cart]], screaming. They are being chased by an unknown [[Gnomes|monster]], which is knocking down trees.''
|-
![[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]
|''(Looks back)'' It's getting closer!
|-
!
|''The monster tries to catch the cart but just falls short. The cart flies off a rock and lands roughly.''
|-
!Dipper
|My name is Dipper. The girl about to puke is my sister Mabel. You may be wondering what we're doing in a golf cart, fleeing from [[gnomes|a creature of unimaginable horror]].
|-
!
|''The monster throws a tree in their path.''
|-
!Mabel
|Look out!
|-
!
|''The image freezes with Mabel and Dipper screaming as they run into the screen.''
|-
!Dipper
|Rest assured, there's a perfectly logical explanation.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Cut back to Dipper and Mabel in the golf cart.''
|-
!Dipper
|Let's rewind. ''(Flashback to Dipper and Mabel in their living room at home)'' It all began when our [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|parents]] decided we could use some fresh air.
|-
!
|''Their parents take their stuff away, give them bags and put some sunscreen on their noses. Cut to a map of Oregon. Zoom in to Gravity Falls.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' They shipped us up north to a sleepy town called Gravity Falls, Oregon, to stay at our [[Stan Pines|great-uncle]]'s place in the woods.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel in the attic hanging up posters.''
|-
!Mabel
|This attic is amazing. Check out all my splinters! ''(Holds up hands, which have gigantic splinters sticking out of them)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Backs up into his bed, which [[Gompers]] is on; not narrating)'' And there's a goat on my bed.
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, friend. ''(Holds out her arm, and Gompers chews on her sleeve)'' Oh! Yes, you can keep chewing on my [[List of Mabel's sweaters|sweater]]. ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' My sister tended to look on the bright side of things.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel rolling down a hill of grass.''
|-
!Mabel
|Yay! Grass!
|-
!
|''A woodpecker pecks on Dipper's hat.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' But I was having a hard time getting used to our new surroundings.
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|''(Jumps out at him wearing a mask)'' Boo!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Not narrating)'' Ah! ''(Falls over)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Takes his mask off)'' Ahahahaha! Hahaha!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' And then there was our Great Uncle Stan. ''(As Stan slaps his knee) That'' guy.
|-
!Stan
|''(Coughs several times and hits his chest)'' It was worth it.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan leading [[tourists]] through the [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' Our uncle had transformed his house into a tourist trap he called "The Mystery Shack." The real mystery was why anyone came.
|-
!
|''The [[List of items in the Mystery Shack|Jackalope's]] antler breaks off.''
|-
!Stan
|Ladies and gentlemen, behold! The Sascrotch!
|-
!
|''Cut to a Sasquatch wearing underwear. Tourists start speaking excitedly, and snap pictures. Cut to Dipper sweeping the wooden floor with a broom. Mabel is looking at stuff.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' And guess who had to work there. ''(Not narrating; sighs)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ooh! ''(Reaches for large eyeball)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Slaps her hand with his 8-ball cane)'' No touching the merchandise!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] driving the Mystery Cart to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' It looked like it was gonna be the same, boring routine all summer. Until one fateful day...
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel peeking through Stan-bobbleheads.''
|-
!Mabel
|He's looking at it! He's looking at it!
|-
!
|''Cut to a [[Unnamed boy in green|boy]] looking at Mabel's note.''
|-
!Boy
|Uh.. ''(Reading note)'' Do you like me? Yes? Definitely? Absolutely!!! ''(Looks around)''
|-
!Mabel
|I rigged it!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Spraying a jar with water and wiping it; not narrating)'' Mabel, I know you're going through your whole "Boy Crazy" phase, but I think you're kind of overdoing it with the "crazy" part.
|-
!Mabel
|What? ''(Blows raspberry)'' Come on, Dipper! This is our first summer away from home! It's my big chance to have an epic summer romance!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, but do you need to flirt with ''every'' guy you meet?
|-
!
|''Flashback to Mabel with a [[Unnamed boy in teal|boy]] near a greeting cards display.''
|-
!Mabel
|My name is Mabel, but you can call me "The girl of your dreams." I'M JOKING! ''(Shoves him into the display)'' Ha ha ha ha ha!
|-
!
|''Flashback to a [[Unnamed turtle guy|boy]] holding a turtle on a bench.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Jumps up behind him)'' Oh my gosh, you like turtles? I like turtles too! What is happening here?
|-
!
|''Flashback to the inside of a [[Mattress Prince's mattress store|mattress store]].''
|-
![[Mattress King]]
|Come one, come all, to the Mattress Prince's kingdom of savings!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hiding behind a set of colorful balloons; pops out head and whispers)'' Take me with you...
|-
!Mattress King
|Ah! ''(Cowers away from Mabel and drops scepter)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Mabel
|Mock all you want, brother, but I got a good feeling about this summer. I wouldn't be surprised if the man of my dreams walked through that door right now.
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks through the door and burps, but it gets caught in his throat)'' Oh! Oh, not good. Ow.
|-
!Mabel
|Aww! Why!
|-
!Dipper
|Ha ha ha!
|-
!Stan
|All right, all right, look alive, people. I need someone to go hammer up these signs in the spooky part of the [[Gravity Falls Forest|forest]].
|-
!Dipper
|''(Quickly)'' Not it!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Quickly)'' Not it!
|-
![[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]
|Uh, also not it.
|-
!Stan
|Nobody asked you, Soos.
|-
!Soos
|I know, and I'm comfortable with that. ''(Eats chocolate bar)''
|-
!Stan
|[[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]], I need you to put up this sign!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Pretends to reach for signs)'' I would, but I, ugh, can't, ugh, reach it, ugh...
|-
!Stan
|I'd fire all of you if I could. All right, let's make it... eenie, meenie, miney... ''(Points at Dipper)'' you.
|-
!Dipper
|Aw, what? Grunkle Stan, whenever I'm in those woods, I feel like I'm being watched.
|-
!Stan
|Ugh, this again.
|-
!Dipper
|I'm telling you, something weird is going on in this town. Just today, my mosquito bites spelled out "BEWARE."
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at Dipper's arm)'' That says "BEWARB." ''(Dipper scratches his arm)'' Look, kid. The whole "monsters in the forest" thing is just local legend, drummed up by guys like me to sell merch to guys like that.
|-
!
|''A [[Unnamed sweaty man|fat, sweaty man]] laughs while looking at a Stan-bobblehead's head bobble.''
|-
!Stan
|So quit being so paranoid! ''(Gives Dipper the signs; Dipper sighs)''
|-
!
|''Cut to a foggy forest with trees getting blown by the wind.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, Grunkle Stan. Nobody ever believes anything I say. ''(Puts one sign up on a tree that says "To The Mystery Shack." He starts to hammer a nail on another [[Bunker|tree trunk]], but it makes a metallic sound. He taps the tree with the hammer, which makes more metallic sounds. He wipes away some dust and opens a secret window revealing a mechanical box with two control switches on top. He tests one control but nothing happens. Then he tries the other. Behind him, a hole opens up in the ground. Gompers bleats and runs away.)'' What the? ''(Looks inside the hole, and there is a [[Journal 3|book]]. He picks the book up and places it on the ground, and checks for people watching. He flips one page and an eye-glass is in it. He looks at the eye-glass and puts it down. He flips another page, and begins reading aloud)'' "It's hard to believe it's been six years since [[Ford Pines|I]] began studying the strange and wondrous secrets of Gravity Falls, Oregon." ''(Flips through pages)'' What is all this? ''(Stops at a page that says "TRUST NO ONE" and starts reading)'' "Unfortunately, my suspicions have been confirmed. I'm being watched. I must hide this book before ''[[Bill Cipher|he]]'' finds it. Remember: in Gravity Falls there is no one you can trust." ''(Closes Journal)'' No one you can trust...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Jumps up behind a log)'' HALLO!
|-
!Dipper
|AH!
|-
!Mabel
|What'cha readin', some nerd thing?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Hides journal behind back)'' Uh, uh, it’s nothing!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Imitating Dipper)'' "Uh, uh, it’s nothing!" ''(Laughs)'' What? Are you actually not gonna show me?
|-
!Gompers
|''(Nibbles the edge of the journal)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uhhh... ''(Glances at Gompers)'' Let's go somewhere private.
|-
!
|''Cut to a view of the Mystery Shack. Dipper and Mabel are in the living room.''
|-
!Dipper
|It's amazing! Grunkle Stan said I was being paranoid, but according to this book, Gravity Falls has this secret dark side. ''(Shows Mabel a page)''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa! Shut. Up! ''(Pushes Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|And get this! After a certain point, the pages just.. stop, like the guy who was writing it... mysteriously disappeared. ''(Doorbell rings)'' Who's that?
|-
!Mabel
|Well, time to spill the beans. ''(Knocks over a can of beans on the table)'' Boop. Beans. This girl's got a date! Woot woot! ''(Falls backward into the chair, giggling)''
|-
!Dipper
|Let me get this straight: in the half hour I was gone, you already found a boyfriend?
|-
!Mabel
|What can I say? I guess I'm just IRRESISTIBLLLLE! ''(Doorbell rings twice)'' Oh. Coming! ''(Runs out)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sits down in chair and begins to read the Journal)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks in and sees Dipper)'' What'cha reading there, slick?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh! ''(Throws the book under the seat cushion and grabs a magazine)'' I was just catching up on, uh... ''(Sees the cover of the magazine)'' [[Gold Chains For Old Men Magazine]]?
|-
!Stan
|That's a good issue.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Standing next to [[Gnomes|Norman]])'' Hey, family! Say hello to my new boyfriend!
|-
!Norman
|'Sup?
|-
!Dipper
|Hey...
|-
!Stan
|How's it hanging?
|-
!Mabel
|We met at the [[Gravity Falls Cemetery|cemetery]]. He's ''really'' deep. ''(Feels his arm)'' Oh. Little muscle there. That's...what a surprise...
|-
!Dipper
|So, what's your name?
|-
!Norman
|Uh. Normal... MAN!
|-
!Mabel
|He means Norman.
|-
!Dipper
|Are you bleeding, Norman?
|-
!Norman
|(''With a red liquid dripping down his face)'' It's jam.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' I love jam! Look. At. This!
|-
!Norman
|So, you wanna go hold hands or... whatever?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, oh, my goodness. ''(Giggles)'' Don't wait up! ''(Runs out)''
|-
!Norman
|''(Points at Stan and Dipper and runs into the wall several times on his way out)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' There was something about Norman that wasn't right. I decided to consult the journal.
|-
!
|''Cuts to Dipper in the attic.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading aloud from Journal)'' Known for their pale skin and bad attitudes these creatures are often mistaken for... teenagers?! Beware Gravity Falls's nefarious... ''(Gasps)''
|-
!
|''We see the journal page on [[The Undead]]. The picture of the zombie becomes Norman.''
|-
!Norman
|''(As the zombie on the journal page) '''Sup.
|-
!Dipper
|ZOMBIE!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan in the bathroom.''
|-
!Stan
|Somebody say "crombie"? What is that, crombie? That's not even a word. You're losing your mind.
|-
!
|''Dipper looks out the window to see Norman walking towards Mabel with outstretched arms while moaning.''
|-
!Mabel
|I like you.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, no! Mabel! No, no, Mabel, watch out!
|-
!Norman
|Huh, huh! ''(Puts hands around Mabel's neck)''
|-
!Dipper
|AHHHHH!
|-
!Norman
|''(Removes arms, revealing flower necklace)'' Huhhh!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Daisies? You scallywag...
|-
!Dipper
|Is my sister really dating a zombie, or am I just going nuts?
|-
!Soos
|''(Screwing in a lightbulb)'' It's a dilemma, to be sure. ''(Dipper gasps)'' I couldn't help but overhear you talkin' aloud to yourself in this empty room.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, you've seen Mabel's boyfriend. He's gotta be a zombie, right?
|-
!Soos
|Hmm. How many brains didja see the guy eat?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks down)'' Zero.
|-
!Soos
|Look, dude, I believe you. I'm always noticing weird stuff in this town. Like the [[Unnamed mailman|mailman]]? Pretty sure that dude's a werewolf.
|-
!
|''Flashback of a hairy mailman walking by Soos, who is eating his lunch outside. Soos scoots away from him, suspicious.''
|-
!Soos
|But ya gotta have evidence. Otherwise, people are gonna think you’re a major league cuckoo clock.
|-
!Dipper
|As always, Soos, you’re right.
|-
!Soos
|My wisdom is both a blessing and a curse.
|-
!Stan
|''(Shouting offscreen)'' Soos! The portable toilets are clogged again!
|-
!Soos
|I am needed elsewhere. ''(Backs out)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' My sister could be in trouble. It was time to get some evidence. 
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper filming Mabel and Norman in the park.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Throws a Frisbee at Norman, who fails to catch it and falls over)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Stops looking through camera and frowns at Norman)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Norman breaking through a door window to open it from the inside and letting Mabel inside the diner.''
|-
!Norman
|''(Stumbles around and crashes, trying to follow Mabel)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks out from behind menu)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Norman frolicking in a field.''
|-
!Norman
|''(Falls into an open grave, then crawls out, hand first, screaming)''
|-
!Mabel and Norman
|''(Pause, then laugh)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' I'd seen enough.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Dipper's room. Mabel is brushing her hair and Dipper enters.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Not Narrating)'' Mabel. We've gotta talk about Norman.
|-
!Mabel
|Isn’t he the best? Check out this giant smooch mark he gave me! ''(Shows her cheek, which has a red spot on it)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah!
|-
!Mabel
|Ha, ha! Gullible. It was just an accident with the leaf blower!
|-
!
|''Flashback to Mabel with a leaf blower.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Putting a picture of Norman on leaf blower's tube)'' Kissing practice! ''(Leans in to leaf blower, but then it sucks in the picture and sticks to her face as well; she runs around)'' AHHH! Turn it off! Turn it off!
|-
!
|''Cut back to present.''
|-
!Mabel
|That was fun.
|-
!Dipper
|No, Mabel, listen! I’m trying to tell you that Norman is not what he seems! ''(Shows her the Journal)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' You think he might be a vampire? That would be so ''awesome''!
|-
!Dipper
|Guess again, sister. SHA-BAM! ''(Holds book open to the Gnomes page)''
|-
!Mabel
|Agh!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, wait. I'm-I'm sorry... ''(Flips to Undead page)'' Sha-bam!
|-
!Mabel
|A zombie? That is not funny, Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|I’m not joking! It all adds up: the bleeding, the limp. He never blinks! Have you noticed that?
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe ''he’s'' blinking when ''you’re'' blinking.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, remember what the book said about Gravity Falls? Trust no one!
|-
!Mabel
|Well, what about ''me'', huh? Why can’t you trust me? ''(Puts on star earrings)'' Beep bop!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, ''(shaking her)'' he's gonna eat your brain!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pushes him away)'' Dipper, listen to me. Norman and I are going on a date at five o’clock, and I'm gonna be ADORABLE, and he's gonna be DREAMY, ''(pushing Dipper out of the room)''
|-
!Dipper
|Bu-bu-but—
|-
!Mabel
|And I am not gonna let you ruin it with one of your crazy CONSPIRACIES! ''(Slams the door)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs and sits down)'' What am I gonna do?
|-
!
|''Cut to the clock, which tells the time at 5:00. The doorbell rings.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pulls on her sweater as she races downstairs)'' Coming! ''(Sees Norman)'' Hey, Norman. How do I look?
|-
!Norman
|Shiny...
|-
!Mabel
|You always know what to say! ''(Walks off with him)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Watching the video he collected)'' Soos was right. I don’t have any real evidence. ''(Video shows Mabel teaching Norman hopscotch, but he only falls over; Dipper fast forwards to Mabel and Norman with Norman's arm around Mabel)'' I guess I can be kind of paranoid sometimes and— ''(on the tape, Norman's hand falls off; he glances around, then reattaches it)'' Wait, WHAT?! ''(Rewinds the tape and watches it again; he screams and tips the chair backwards)'' I was right! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! ''(Races outside)'' Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|''(On a stage in front of a bunch of tourists; to the crowd:)'' And here we have Rock that looks like a face rock: the rock that looks like a face.
|-
![[Unnamed hillbilly]]
|Does it look like a rock?
|-
!Stan
|No, it looks like a face.
|-
!Fat Tourist
|Is it a face?
|-
!Stan
|It’s a rock that ''looks'' like a face!
|-
!Dipper
|Over here! Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|For the fifth time! It's-it's not an actual face!
|-
!Dipper
|Errrgh!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Norman in the woods.''
|-
!Mabel
|Finally, we’re alone.
|-
!Norman
|Yes. Alone...
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|Stan! Stan! ''(Sees Wendy drive up in a golf cart and runs over)'' Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! I need to borrow the golf cart so I can save my sister from a zombie!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Gives Dipper the key and walks off)'' Try not to hit any pedestrians.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gets in and starts to drive, but Soos stops him)''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, it's me: Soos. This is for the zombies. ''(Gives Dipper a shovel)''
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks.
|-
!Soos
|''(Holds up a baseball bat)'' And this is in case you see a piñata.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes the bat)'' Uh... Thanks? ''(Drives off)''
|-
!Soos
|Better safe than sorry!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the woods.''
|-
!Norman
|Uh, Mabel, now that we’ve gotten to know each other, there’s... ''(exhales)'' ...there’s something I should tell you.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, Norman, you can tell me anything! ''(Thinking)'' Please be a vampire, please be a vampire!
|-
!Norman
|All right, just... just don’t freak out, okay? Just... just keep an open mind, be cool! ''(Unzips his coat and throws it off; underneath are five gnomes standing on top of each other. The top gnome speaks)''
|-
![[Gnomes#Jeff|Jeff]]
|Is this weird? Is this too weird? Do you need to sit down?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Stares at the gnomes in total shock)''
|-
!Jeff
|R-r-right, I’ll explain. So! We’re gnomes. First off. Get that one outta the way.
|-
!Mabel
|Uh...
|-
!Jeff
|I’m Jeff, and here we have [[Gnomes#Carson|Carson]], [[Gnomes#Stevve|Steve]], [[Gnomes#Jason|Jason]] and... I’m sorry, I always forget your name.
|-
![[Gnomes#Shmebulock|Shmebulock]]
|Shmebulock.
|-
!Jeff
|''(Snaps his fingers)'' Shmebulock! Yes! Anyways, long story short, us gnomes have been lookin' for a new queen! Right, guys?
|-
!Gnomes except Jeff
|Queen! Queen! Queen!
|-
!Jeff
|Heh. So what do you say? ''(Taps Steve with his foot, and the gnomes work together to make "Norman" kneel in a proposing fashion)'' Will you join us in holy matrignomey? Matri...matri-''mo''-ny! Blah! Can’t talk today!
|-
!Mabel
|Look... I'm sorry, guys. You're really sweet, but, I'm a girl, and you're gnomes, and it's like, "what"? Yikes...
|-
!Jeff
|We understand. We'll never forget you, Mabel. ''(The gnomes look sad and Mabel smiles)'' Because we're gonna kidnap you.
|-
!Mabel
|Huh?
|-
!Jeff
|''(Yells and jumps at her)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Screams)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper driving through the woods.''
|-
!Dipper
|Don't worry, Mabel! I'll save you from that zombie!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Off-screen)'' Help!
|-
!Dipper
|Hold on!
|-
!
|''Cut to the gnomes trying to pin down Mabel.''
|-
!Jeff
|The more you struggle, the more awkward this is gonna be for everybody! Just, ha ha, okay. Get her arm there, Steve!
|-
!Mabel
|''(With Steve biting her sweater arm)'' Let go of me! ''(Punches Steve off)''
|-
!Steve
|''(Bounces around, then stand upright and pukes a rainbow)''
|-
!Dipper
|What the ''heck'' is going on here?!
|-
!Gnome
|''(Hisses at him)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! Norman turned out to be a bunch of gnomes! And they're total jerks! ''(As a gnome pulls her hair)'' Hair! Hair! Hair!
|-
!Dipper
|Gnomes? Huh, I was ''way'' off. ''(Takes the journal out of his vest and reads the relevant page aloud)'' "Gnomes: little men of the Gravity Falls Forest. Weaknesses: unknown." ''(When Dipper lowers the book, he sees that the gnomes have managed to tie Mabel to the ground)''
|-
!Mabel
|Aw, come on!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks up to Jeff)'' Hey, HEY! Let go of my sister!
|-
!Jeff
|Oh! Ha ha, hey, there! Um, you know, this is all really just a big misunderstanding. You see, your sister's not in danger. She's just marrying all one thousand of us and becoming our gnome queen for all eternity! Isn't that right, honey?
|-
!Mabel
|You guys are butt-faces!
|-
!Gnome
|''(Covers her mouth)''
|-
!Mabel
|Mmmm-MMMMM!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holds up the shovel he brought, pointing it at Jeff)'' Give her back right now, or else!
|-
!Jeff
|You think you can stop us, boy? You have no idea what we're capable of. The gnomes are a powerful race! Do not trifle with the—
|-
!Dipper
|''(Casually tosses him away with the shovel)''
|-
!Jeff
|AH!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Cuts Mabel free with the shovel)''
|-
!Mabel
|Yah! ''(Kicks gnomes away; Dipper and Mabel get in the cart)''
|-
!Jeff
|He's getting away with our queen! No, no, no!
|-
!Dipper
|Seatbelt. ''(Mabel buckles, he backs up and then he drives away)''
|-
!Jeff
|You've messed with the wrong creatures, boy! Gnomes of the forest: ASSEMBLE! ''(Various gnomes come out and stack up)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hurry, before they come after us!
|-
!Dipper
|I wouldn't worry about it. See their little legs? Those suckers are tiny! ''(Stops the cart as he hears a stomping sound; a giant stacked gnome stops at the cart)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dang.
|-
!Jeff
|''(On the top, using gnomes' hats like levers)'' All right, teamwork, guys. Like we practiced. ''(Gnomes growl)''
|-
!Mabel
|Move, MOVE!

!Gnomes
|''(Run frantically back into position and they chase the kids again)''
|-
!Jeff
|Come back with our queen!
|-
!Mabel
|It's getting closer!

|-
!Gnomes
|''(Chew cart and cause havoc)''
|-
!Gnome
|''(Hanging from side of cart)'' Ha ha!

|''Mabel elbow punches a gnome off. Shmebulock jumps up behind Dipper, who grabs him and slams him into the steering wheel out of annoyance.''
|-
!Shmebulock
|Shmebulock... ''(Falls out of the cart)''
|-
!Gnome
|''(Jumps onto the cart and claws Dipper's face)''
|-
!Mabel
|I'll save you, Dipper! ''(Repeatedly punches the gnome off of Dipper's face and the gnome falls off with Dipper's hat)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Dazed from the punches)'' Thanks, Mabel...
|-
!Mabel
|Don't mention it.
|-
!Gnome Giant
|''(Picks up tree and throws it)''
|-
!Mabel
|Look out!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|AAAAAAHHHHHH!

|-
!Dipper
|Uh, where's Grunkle Stan?!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan in the shack with some tourists.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Holding up a swirly pattern on a stick)'' Behold! The world's most distracting object.
|-
!Tourists
|Oooh...
|-
!Stan
|Just try to look away, you can't! I can't even remember what I was talking about.
|-
!Jeff
|It's the end of the line, kids! Mabel, marry us before we do something crazy!
|-
!Dipper
|There's gotta be a way out of this!
|-
!Mabel
|I gotta do it.
|-
!Dipper
|What?! Mabel, don't do this! Are you crazy?
|-
!Mabel
|Trust me.
|-
!Dipper
|What?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, just this once. Trust me!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Glances at gnomes, then Mabel, then backs away)''
|-
!Mabel
|All right, Jeff. I'll marry you.
|-
!Jeff
|Hot dog! Help me down there, Jason! ''(Climbing down to her)'' Thanks, Andy! All right, left foot, there we go, watch those fingers, Mike. ''(Approaches Mabel and holds out diamond ring)'' Eh? Eh?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holds out hand)''
|-
!Jeff
|''(Puts the ring on her hand)'' Bada-bing, bada-bam! Now let's get you back into the forest, honey!
|-
!Mabel
|You may now kiss the bride!
|-
!Jeff
|Well, don't mind if I do. ''(Leans up to kiss Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Leans out to kiss Jeff, then takes out leaf blower)''
|-
!Jeff
|Ah! Hey, hey, wait a minute! Whoa, whoa! Wh-what's goin' on?! ''(Gets sucked half-way into leaf-blower)''
|-
!Mabel
|That's for lying to me! ''(Increases the sucking power)'' THAT'S for breaking my heart!
|-
!Jeff
|''(Slowly getting sucked in further)'' Ow! My face!
|-
!Mabel
|And THIS is for messing with my brother! ''(Aims; to Dipper)'' Wanna do the honors?
|-
!Dipper
|On three!
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
|One, two, three! ''(Blast Jeff towards the gnome monster)''
|-
!Gnome Giant
|''(Explodes into separate gnomes)''
|-
!Jeff
|''(Flying off into the distance)'' I'll get you back for this!... ''(Other gnomes scream when they fall)''
|-
!Gnome
|Who's giving orders? I need orders!
|-
!Gnome 2
|My arms are tired.
|-
!Dipper
|''(While Mabel moves the leaf blower back and forth, blowing gnomes away)'' Anyone else want some?
|-
!Gnomes
|''(Run off on all fours; one gets caught in a six-pack holder)''

|''(Picks the six-pack holder up and runs off)'' Blah-ah-ah.
|-
!Gnome in the six-pack holder
|''(In the background)'' Aaaaahhhhh!
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, Dipper? I, um...I'm sorry for ignoring your advice. You really were just looking out for me.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, don't be like that. You saved our butts back there.
|-
!Mabel
|I guess I'm just sad that my first boyfriend turned out to be a bunch of gnomes.
|-
!Dipper
|Look on the bright side. Maybe the next one ''will'' be a vampire!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, you're just saying that!
|-
!Dipper
|Awkward sibling hug?
|-
!Mabel
|Awkward sibling hug.
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
|''(Hug and pat each other)'' Pat, pat.
|-
!
|''The two walk into the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Stan
|Yeesh. You two get hit by a bus or something? Ahah!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Begin to walk away)''
|-
!Stan
|Uh, hey! W-wouldn't you know it? Um, I accidentally overstocked some inventory, so, uh... how's about each of you take one item from the gift shop? On the house, y'know?
|-
!Mabel
|Really?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Folds arms) ''What's the catch?
|-
!Stan
|The catch is do it before I change my mind, now take something.
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
|''(Look around at items)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks up a blue pine tree hat from one of the shelves and looks in a mirror)'' Hmm. That oughta do the trick!
|-
!Mabel
|And I will have a... ''(Grabs item from box, hides it, and twirls around)'' [[Mabel's grappling hook|GRAPPLING HOOK]]! Yes!
|-
!Stan
|''(To Dipper)'' Wouldn't she rather have, like, a doll, or something?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Fires the grappling hook up at the ceiling; it catches and pulls her up)'' GRAPPLING HOOK!
|-
!Stan
|Fair enough!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Dipper's bedroom. Dipper is writing while Mabel jumps on her bed, laughing.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Writing in Journal while narrating)'' This journal told me there was no one in Gravity Falls I could trust. ''(Looking at Mabel)'' But when you battle a hundred gnomes side-by-side with someone, you realize that they've probably always got your back.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shoots grappling hook, then reels it back with a stuffed animal attached)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, Mabel, could you get the light?
|-
!Mabel
|I'm on it! ''(Knocks light out the window with the grappling hook)'' It works!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Mabel
|Grappling hook...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating)'' Our uncle told us there was nothing strange about this town. But who knows what other secrets are waiting to be unlocked.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack exterior. Stan walks in holding a lantern. He goes into the gift shop and puts a code into the [[vending machine]]. The machine opens, and Stan walks inside, looking side-to-side before closing it behind him.''

|''The episode opens with [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] at a table during breakfast.''
|-
!Mabel Pines
|''(Holding Sir Syrup)'' Are you ready for the ultimate challenge?
|-
!Dipper Pines
|''(Holding Mountie Man)'' I'm always ready!
|-
!Mabel
|Then you know what this means!
|-
!
|''Camera zooms out to show Mabel and Dipper holding their respective syrup bottles.''
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
| Syrup race! ''(Tilt syrup bottles back and start to drip syrup into their mouths)'' Ahhh!
|-
!Mabel
|Go, Sir Syrup!
|-
!Dipper
|Go, Mountie Man!
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
|Go! Go!
|-
!Dipper
|Go! Go!
|-
!Mabel
|Almost... almost... ''(Taps the bottom of her bottle and the syrup drips onto her tongue)'' Yes! ''(Coughs)'' I won! ''(Coughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks up and reads newspaper)'' Ho ho, no way! Hey Mabel, check this out.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looking at ad in newspaper)'' Human-sized hamster balls? ''(Gasps)'' I'm human-sized!
|-
!Dipper
|No, no, Mabel. This. ''(Points to a monster photo contest ad)'' We see weirder stuff than that every day! We didn't get any photos of those [[gnomes]], did we?
|-
!Mabel
|Nope, just memories. And this beard hair. ''(Holds up beard hair)''
|-
!Dipper
|Why did you save that?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shrugs and makes an "I dunno" sound)''
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|Good morning, knuckleheads. You two know what day it is?
|-
!Dipper
|Um... Happy anniversary?
|-
!Mabel
|''Mazel tov''!
|-
!Stan
|''(Hits Dipper's head with a newspaper)'' It's Family Fun Day, genius! ''(Walks over to fridge and gets out milk)'' We're cuttin' off work and having one of those, you know, ''(sniffs milk in the refrigerator)'' bonding-type deals.
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, is this gonna be anything like our last family bonding day?
|-
!
|''Flashback to Dipper and Mabel helping Grunkle Stan make counterfeit money''
|-
!Stan
|You call that Ben Franklin? He looks like a woman! ''(Hears police sirens)'' Uh-oh.
|-
!
|''Cut to present.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shudders)'' The county jail was so cold.
|-
!Stan
|All right, maybe I haven't been the best summer caretaker. But I swear, today we're gonna have some ''real'' family fun. Now who wants to put on some blindfolds and get into [[Stanmobile|my car]]?
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
|YAY!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, what?
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!
|''Cut to a road in the [[Gravity Falls Forest|forest]]. Grunkle Stan is driving his car with Dipper and Mabel blindfolded in the backseat. Stan leans down to adjust the radio and the tires screech.''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa whoa! ''(Sighs)'' Blindfolds never lead to anything good.
|-
!Mabel
|Wow! I feel like all my other senses are heightened. I can see with my fingers! ''(Touches Dipper's face, making him laugh)''
|-
!
|''Car jumps, making the twins fly into the doors''.
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Grunkle Stan, are ''you'' wearing a blindfold?
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha. Nah, but with these cataracts I might as well be. What is that, a woodpecker? ''(Drives through a wooden guardrail, making the twins scream)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Lake Gravity Falls|lake]]. Dipper and Mabel, still blindfolded, are standing in front of the parked car, which now has branches and sticks caught in the grill.''
|-
!Stan
|Okay, okay. Open 'em up!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Take blindfolds off)''
|-
!Stan
|Ta-da! It's fishin' season!
|-
!Mabel
|Fishing?
|-
!Dipper
|What're you playin' at, old man?
|-
!Stan
|You're gonna love it! The whole town's out here!
|-
!
|''Camera pans across the lake showing various townspeople doing different fishing activities.''
|-
![[Lazy Susan]]
|''(Waving pan)'' Here, fishy fishies! Get into the pan!
|-
![[Toby Determined]]
|''(Taking picture of man with large fish)'' Say cheese! ''(Takes picture, the flash causing the man to fall backwards into the lake)''
|-
![[Marcus, Kevin and Gus|Marcus]]
|''(To his father [[Manly Dan]]:)'' Uh, is this good? ''(Holds up a fishing pole)''
|-
!Manly Dan
|NO! ''(Takes the pole and breaks it in half)'' I'll show you how a ''real'' man fishes! ''(Grabs a fish straight out of water)'' Ha ha ha ha ha! ''(Throws fish on the floor of their boat and jumps on it, he punches it repeatedly)''
|-
!Marcus, Kevin and Gus
|''(Chanting:)'' Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|''(To Manly Dan:)'' Get 'em! Get 'em!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Pines.''
|-
!Stan
|That's some quality family bonding!
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, why do you wanna ''bond'' with us all of a sudden?
|-
!Stan
|Come on, this is gonna be great! I've never had fishing buddies before. The guys from the lodge won't go with me: they don't "like" or "trust" me.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Quietly, to Dipper:)'' I think he actually wants to fish with us.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, I know what'll cheer you sad sacks up. ''(Slaps hats on Dipper and Mabel)'' Pow! Pines family fishing hats! That-that's hand stitching, you know.
|-
!
|''The "L" on the "MABEL" hat peels off.''
|-
!Stan
|It's just gonna be you, me, and those goofy hats on a boat for ten hours!
|-
!Dipper
|Ten hours?
|-
!Stan
|I brought the joke book! ''(Holds up [[1001 Yuk 'Em Ups]])''
|-
!Dipper
|No! NO!
|-
!Mabel
|There has to be a way out of this.
|-
![[Old Man McGucket]]
|(''Offscreen'') I SEEN IT! I SEEN IT AGAIN! (''Runs from dock, crashing into and overturning various things'') The Gravity Falls [[Gobblewonker]]! Come quick before it scrabdoodles away! (''Dances frantically'') Eh, eh, ha ha hoo, (''Slaps himself'') Ah, hee-hee...
|-
!Mabel
|Awww... He's doing a happy jig!
|-
!McGucket
|''(To Mabel:) ''NOOO! It's a jig of grave danger!
|-
![[Tate McGucket]]
|''(Comes out and sprays Old Man McGucket with a spray bottle)'' Hey, hey! Now what did I tell you about scaring my customers? This is your last warning, Dad!
|-
!McGucket
|But I got proof this time, by gummity!
|-
!
|''Cut to dock.''
|-
!McGucket
|''(Points at boat)'' BEHOLD! It's the Gobble-dy-wonker what done did it! It had a long neck like a gee-raffe! And wrinkly skin like...like this gentleman right here! ''(Points to Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Picking his ear)'' Huh?
|-
!McGucket
|It chawed my boat up to smitheroons, and shim-shammed over to [[Scuttlebutt Island]]! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME!
|-
![[Sheriff Blubs]]
|Attention all units! We got ourselves a crazy old man!
|-
!
|''Everyone but the Pines and the ranger point and laugh at Old Man McGucket.''
|-
!Tate McGucket
|''(Shakes head in shame)''
|-
!McGucket
|''(Walking off)'' Aww, donkey spittle! Aw, banjo polish!
|-
!Stan
|Well, that happened. Now let's untie this boat and get out on that lake! ''(Steps into his [[Stanowar|rowboat]] and starts untying it from the dock)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, did you hear what that old dude said?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Mimicking Old Man McGucket:)'' "Aww, donkey shpittle!"
|-
!Dipper
|The other thing. About the monster. If we can snag a photo of it, we can split the prize fifty-fifty.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' That's two fifties!
|-
!Dipper
|Imagine what you could do with five. Hundred. Dollars!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel's imagination. She is inside a human sized hamster ball in front of a [[List of animals|hamster]] in a smaller hamster ball.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To hamster:)'' Not so high and mighty anymore!
|-
!Hamster
|Aww...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Rolling back and forth)'' Aha haha haha. ''(Continues to giggle and crashes through the wall and rolls out onto the street and meets [[Xyler and Craz]])'' Hey, boys! You can look, but ya can't touch. ''(When the light turns green, Mabel scurries down the street in her ball)'' Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak!
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|Awesome!
|-
!
|''Cut back to reality.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Snapping fingers)'' Mabel! Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, I am one million percent on board with this!
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan! Change of plans: we're taking that boat to Scuttlebutt Island, and we're gonna find that Gobblewonker!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Cheering) ''Monster hunt! Monster hunt!
|-
!McGucket
|''(Joining the chant) ''Monster hunt!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel stop chanting and stare at McGucket.''
|-
!McGucket
|Monster... Eh... I'll go.
|-
!
|''A large honking sound is heard.''
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|''(Pulls up in his [[S.S. Cool Dude|boat]])'' You dudes say somethin' about a monster hunt?
|-
!Mabel
|Soos!
|-
!Soos
|Wassup, hambone! ''(Soos and Mabel fist bump and make explosion noises)'' Dude, you could totally use my boat for your hunt. It's got a steering wheel, chairs; normal boat stuff.
|-
!Stan
|All right, all right, let's think this through. Ya kids could go waste your time on some epic monster-finding adventure, ''or'' you could spend the day learning how to tie knots and skewer worms with your Great Uncle Stan!
|-
!
|''The twins look at Soos in his boat; he does a robot dance. They look back at Stan in his leaky old boat; he sniffs his left armpit. They look at Scuttlebutt Island in the distance. They grin at each other.''
|-
!Stan
|So, whaddaya say?
|-
!
|''The twins drive off laughing with Soos in his boat toward Scuttlebutt Island, leaving Stan behind.''
|-
!Mabel
|We made the right choice!
|-
!Soos
|Yes!
|-
!Stan
|Ingrates! Aw, who needs 'em? I got a whole box of creepy fishing lures to keep ''me'' company. ''(After a moment of looking at the lure with flies buzzing around them, Stan cringes in disgust and closes the box)''
|-
!
|''Cut to S.S. Cool Dude, headed for the island. Dipper stands on the stern of the boat, with one foot on the guardrail. He adjusts the visor of his cap.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Turns around) ''Hoist the anchor!
|-
!Soos
|''(Pulls up cinderblock anchor)''
|-
!Dipper
|Raise the flag!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holds up beach towel)'' We're gonna find that Gobblewonker!
|-
!Dipper
|We're gonna win that photo contest!
|-
!Soos
|Do any of you dudes have sunscreen?
|-
!Dipper
|We're gonna... go get sunscreen!
|-
!Mabel & Soos
|Yay!
|-
!
|''The boat does a U-turn away from the island. Underwater, a strange shape swims by.''
|-
!
|''Cut to black for commercial break.''
|-
!
|''The scene begins with Dipper pacing on the boat in front of Mabel and Soos.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright. If we wanna win this contest, we've gotta do it right! Think. What's the number one problem with most monster hunts?
|-
!Soos
|You're a side character, then you die within the first five minutes of the movie. Dude, am I a side character?! Do y'ever think about stuff like that?
|-
!Dipper
|No, no, no. Camera trouble! Say Bigfoot shows up. Soos, be Bigfoot?
|-
!Soos
|''(Strikes a Bigfoot pose)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(In mock acting voice:)'' There he is! Bigfoot! ''(Pats life vest)'' Uh-oh, no camera! ''(Pulls camera out of jacket)'' Oh, wait, here's one! Aw, no film! ''(In normal voice:)'' You see? You see what I'm, doing here?
|-
!Soos
|Oh, yeah. Dude's got a point.
|-
!Dipper
|That's why I bought ''seventeen'' disposable cameras! ''(Revealing cameras as he lists off their locations) ''Two on my ankle, three in my jacket, four for each of you, three extras in this bag, and one... under my hat! There's no way we're gonna miss this. Okay everybody, let's test our cameras out!
|-
!Soos
|''(Takes a picture of himself, the flash startling him)'' Aw, dude! ''(Throws the camera overboard)''
|-
!Dipper
|You see? This is exactly why you need backup cameras. We still have sixteen!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Throws a camera at a seagull flying over her head)'' Ah, bird!
|-
!Dipper
|Fifteen! Okay, guys, I repeat; don't lose your cameras!
|-
!Soos
|Wait, lose the cameras?
|-
!Dipper
|DON'T!
|-
!Soos
|Dude, I just threw two away.
|-
!Dipper
|Thirteen! All right! We still have thirteen camera-- ''(He accidentally crushes one with his fist)'' Twelve. We have twelve cameras.
|-
!Mabel
|So what's the plan? Throw more cameras overboard or what?
|-
!Dipper
|NO! No. Okay. You'll be lookout, Soos can work the steering wheel, and I'll be captain.
|-
!Mabel
|What? Why do you get to be captain? What about Mabel, huh? ''(Chanting:) ''Ma-bel! Ma-bel! Ma-bel! Ma-bel!
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not sure that's a good idea.
|-
!Mabel
|What about co-captain?
|-
!Dipper
|There's no such thing as co-captain.
|-
!Mabel
|Aw, whoops. ''(Tosses a camera into the water)''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, fine! You can be co-captain.
|-
!Soos
|Can I be associate co-captain?
|-
!Mabel
|As co-captain, I authorize that request.
|-
!Dipper
|Well, as first co-captain, our number one order of business is to lure the monster out with this. ''(Gestures at a barrel of Fish Food)''
|-
!Soos
|Permission to taste some?
|-
!Dipper
|Granted.
|-
!Mabel
|Permission co-granted.
|-
!Soos
|Permission associate co-granted. ''(Licks some, than gags and wipes his tongue, coughing)'' Dude, I don't know what I expected that to taste like!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Laughing)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, Soos...
|-
!Stan
|''(Watching them)'' Traitors! Ah, I'll find my own fishing buddies! ''(Looks around and sees a couple sitting in a boat up ahead)'' Ah! ''(Starts his boat's engine)'' There's my new pals!
|-
![[Reginald]]
|''(Turned away from [[Rosanna]], looking at a ring in a box; he takes a breath)'' Now that we're alone, Rosanna, there's a burning question which my heart longs to ask of you.
|-
!Rosanna
|''(Tearing up)'' Oh, Reginald!
|-
!Stan
|Hey! ''(Pulls his boat up to theirs)'' Wanna hear a joke? Here goes. My ex-wife still misses me...but her aim is gettin' better! ''(Pause)'' Her aim is gettin' better! ''(Pause)'' Y'see, it's-it's funny because marriage is terrible.
|-
!Reginald and Rosanna
|''(Row their boat away)''
|-
!Stan
|What?
|-
!
|''Cut to S.S. Cool Dude approaching Scuttlebutt Island. There is fog everywhere. Soos is at the back of the boat shoveling fish food over the side. Dipper and Mabel are at the front. Dipper is trying to see through the fog while Mabel is playing ventriloquist with a pelican.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey! How's it going? ''(As pelican:)'' It's going awesome! Bow bow, buh bow bow!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, leave that thing alone.
|-
!Mabel
|''(As pelican:)'' Aw, I don't mind none! ''(As Mabel:)'' Hey, look, I'm drinking water! ''(As pelican while drinking water:)'' Twinkle, twinkle little... ''(chokes on water and coughs, and the pelican flies away)''
|-
!Dipper
|Aren't you supposed to be doing lookout?
|-
!Mabel
|Look out! ''(Throws a volley ball at Dipper, hitting him on the arm)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holds arm and shivers)''
|-
!Mabel
|Heh, heh. But seriously, I'm on it.
|-
!
|''The boat jolts to a sudden stop having crashed into the shore of the island.''
|-
!Mabel
|See? We're here! I'm a lookout genius! Hamster ball, here we come!
|-
!
|''The trio disembarks and ventures into the foggy woods. Dipper leads the group while carrying a lantern. They soon come to a large sign nailed to a tree that says "Scuttlebutt Island." Soos and Mabel stop in front of it.''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, check it out. ''(Covers the "Scuttle" part of the sign)'' Butt Island.
|-
!Mabel
|Soos, you rapscallion! ''(To Dipper:)'' Hey! Why aren't you laughing? Are you ''scared''?
|-
!Dipper
|Pssh! Yeah, right! I'm not--
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pokes him on the nose and blows a raspberry)'' Yeah, you are!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! ''(He drops the lantern as Mabel continues poking him and blowing raspberries)'' Quit...! Stop! Mabel!
|-
!
|''There's a growling noise in the distance. Mabel stops teasing Dipper and they look around. Soos comes up to them.''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, did you guys hear that?
|-
!Mabel
|What was that? Was it your stomach?
|-
!Soos
|Nah, my stomach normally sounds like whale noises.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Listens to Soos' stomach, which makes whale noises)'' Wow. So majestic.
|-
!Possum
|''(Grabs lantern and runs away)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)'' Our lantern! Aww! I can't see anything!
|-
!Soos
|Duuude, I dunno, man. Maybe this, uh... Maybe this isn't worth it.
|-
!Dipper
|Not worth it? Guys, imagine what would happen if we got that picture!

|''Cut to Dipper's imagination, where he is dressed like [[wikipedia:Indiana_Jones|Indiana Jones]] being interviewed on a talk show.''
|-
![[Charlie (talk show host)|Charlie]]
|Tonight we're here with adventure seeker Dipper Pines, who bravely photographed the elusive Gobblewonker! Tell me, Dipper: what's the secret to your success?
|-
!Dipper
|Well, I run away from nothing. ''(Dumps coffee into mouth; an embarrassing picture of Grunkle Stan appears on screen)'' Nothing, except for when I ran away from my annoying Grunkle Stan, who I ditched in order to pursue that lake monster.
|-
!Charlie
|How right you were to do so. He looked like a real piece of work. I don't often do this, but I feel the need to give you an award! ''(Gives him a medal and they get their picture taken)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Crashes through the wall in a hamster ball)'' CHARLIE! WHY WON'T YOU INTERVIEW ME?! ''(Chases after Dipper and Charlie, screaming like a maniac)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to real life.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Smiles)'' I'm in!
|-
!Mabel
|Me, too!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Run off)''
|-
!Soos
|All right, dudes, I'm comin'! ''(Chases them)''
|-
!Soos

!Mabel
|[[My name is Mabel]]!<br />It rhymes with table!<br />It also rhymes with... glabel!<br />It also rhymes with... shmabel!
|-
!Soos
|Dude, we should be writing this down.
|-
!Dipper
|(''Holding a camera'') Guys, guys, guys! You hear something?
|-
!
|''The growling noise from earlier can be heard; a flock of birds flies overhead, away from the sound.''
|-
!Dipper
|This is it! This is it!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Punching each other excitedly and walking towards the sound)'' Yes yes yes! Hoo hoo hoo!
|-
!Soos
|''(Grabs a stick and follows them into the fog)''
|-
!
|''Walking through the fog, Soos stops the group when he spots a lake monster silhouette. The group ducks behind a log.''
|-
!Dipper
|Everyone: Get your cameras ready!
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, and Soos
|''(Turn cameras on)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ready? GO!
|-
!
|''Soos yells and jumps over the log, holding his camera in front of him as he runs toward the silhouette, snapping photos at random. The twins follow him, but as they get closer, they discover the silhouette was the remains of a wrecked boat with beavers living on it.''
|-
!Beaver 1
|''(Subtitled)'' I love cavorting!
|-
!Beaver 2
|''(Subtitled)'' That deserves a hug! ''(Hugs Beaver 1)''
|-
!Beaver 3
|''(Thumps tail and walks sideways of the boat)''
|-
!Dipper
|But... but what was that noise, then? I heard a monster noise!
|-
!
|''The "monster noise" sounds again. It turns out to be a beaver chewing on, and sometimes activating, a rusty old chainsaw.''
|-
!Soos
|Sweet! Beaver with a chainsaw. ''(Takes pictures of it)''
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe that old guy was crazy after all.
|-
!Mabel
|He ''did'' use the word "scrapdoodle."
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan teaching [[Hank's son]] how to thread a line.''
|-
!Stan
|Look, when you're threadin' the line--lot of people don't know this--but you wanna use a ''barrel'' knot. ''(Whispering)'' That's a secret from one fishing buddy to another! Heh heh.
|-
!Hank's son
|Uh, I, uh, who are you, exactly?
|-
!Stan
|Just call me your GRUNKLE STAN!
|-
![[Hank's wife]]
|Sir, SIR, SIR! Why are you talking to our son? If you don't leave right now, I'm calling the police!
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha, you see, the thing about that is... ''(Starts his motor and speeds away)''
|-
!Hank's Wife
|Go bother your own kids!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Scuttlebutt Island.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Taking pictures of a beaver posing on a stump)'' Ooh, yeah! Work it! Work it! Nice! Nice! Gimme another one of those! Yeah, I like that one.
|-
!Dipper
|What're we gonna say to Grunkle Stan? We ditched him over nothing. ''(Throws a stone into the lake and sighs. The rock Dipper is sitting on shakes)'' Hey... guys, do you feel that? ''(The rocks sinks under the water and Dipper swims to shore)'' Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
|-
!
|''The Gobblewonker's silhouette is seen swimming away.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ahhh!
|-
!Dipper
|This is it! ''(Takes pictures)'' Come on! This is our chance! ''(Soos and Mabel back up)'' What's wrong with you guys?
|-
![[Gobblewonker robot]]
|''(Swims back towards the island and begins to rise as the other speak)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper...?
|-
!Soos
|Dude...?
|-
!Dipper
|It's not that hard, all right? All you gotta do is point, and shoot. Like this! ''(Aims camera at Gobblewonker and realizes it's right in front of him)''
|-
!Gobblewonker robot
|''(Roars, causing Dipper to drop his camera and the three to run away)''
|-
!Soos
|Run!
|-
!
|''The Gobblewonker pushes a tree over which falls and almost hits Dipper and Mabel, but Dipper lunges and Mabel and they roll out of the way. The continue to run and dodge falling trees and eventually catch up with Soos.''
|-
!Soos
|Get back to the boat! HURRY! ''(The Gobblewonker snaps at Mabel who hops onto Soos's back)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Aims camera at Gobblewonker, but trips over a root, stopping the camera)'' The picture! ''(Starts to run to the camera)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Grabs Dipper) ''Dude, if it makes you feel any better, I got tons of pictures of those beavers, dude!
|-
!Dipper
|WHY WOULD THAT MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?!
|-
!
|''Commercial break.''
|-
!
|''Open with the group running towards the boat. Soos helps the others on, the climbs in himself. Soos's presence pushes the boat back into the water and he runs towards the helm.''
|-
!Soos
|Let's get outta here, dudes! ''(They start driving away in the boat backwards)''
|-
!Dipper
|All right! This is it! ''(Tries to take a picture)'' ''Cracked lens''?! Soos! Get a photo!
|-
!Soos
|''(Throwing cameras at the monster)''
|-
!Dipper
|WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
|-
!Soos
|Oh! I still got one left! Don't worry, dude! ''(Throws a camera to Dipper but misses hitting the wall and breaking the camera)''
|-
!
|''The Gobblewonker dives into the water and begins to chase the gang. Soos steers the ship forwards and drives away from it.''
|-
!Dipper
|Go, go, go, go, go!

!
|''Cut to Stan on his boat, struggling to tie a knot.''
|-
!Stan
|Er, ugh, gah! Mollycoddling...

|-
!Stan
|Aw, come on! Boo! Boo!
|-
!Pop Pop
|Hey, now! What's the big idea?
|-
!Shmipper
|Maybe he has no one who wuvs him, Pop Pop.
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, well, I... I...
|-
!
|''S.S. Cool Dude drives past him and soaks him. He throws his hat to the ground in frustration, then sits down and sighs.''
|-
!Dipper
|SOOS! BEAVERS!
|-
!Beavers
|''(Subtitled)'' We're still beavers.
|-
!
|''The boat crashes into the old, broken boat and beavers fly everywhere, biting the boat and the crew.''
|-
!Soos
|Ah, beavers! Oh, no!
|-
!
|''Beavers are biting Dipper's hat. Mabel shakes a beaver off of her arm, and a beaver lunges at Soos, who stumbles away from the wheel. Mabel takes control on the wheel, steering away from the Gobblewonker. Dipper tries to dislodge a beaver from the side of the boat while Soos runs in circles crying in pain from the beaver still on his face. Dipper throws beavers towards the Gobblewonker who dives and continues to chase them under the water. The S.S. Cool Dude drives through a place with people fishing, who are overturned by the Gobblewonker behind them.''
|-
!
|''Cut to Manly Dan and his sons, Dan headlocking a fish and his sons cheering for him.''
|-
!Manly Dan
|''(With a fish)'' Headlock!

!Marcus, Kevin and Gus
|Dad! Dad! Dad!
|-
!
|''Their boat is turned over by a wave from the Gobblewonker. Fish start raining down on them.''
|-
!Manly Dan
|The fishes! They seek revenge! Swim, boys! Swim!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the S.S. Cool Dude. The Gobblewonker swipes at the boat and manages to knock the control cabin off.''

!Mabel
|Aah! Look out!
|-
!Man
|''(Transporting a glass sheet over the water with Man 2 by boat)'' Easy...Easy...
|-
!
|''The boat drives through it and breaks it.''
|-
!Man 2
|My glass!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sees dead-end ahead)'' WHERE DO I GO?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks around. Takes out Journals and flips through pages)'' Um... uh... GO INTO THE FALLS! I think there might be a cave behind there!
|-
!Mabel
|MIGHT BE?!
|-
!
|''They all scream and the boat goes through the waterfall and into cave behind. Their boat crashes, sending them into the dirt. The all stand up, and turn around to see the Gobblewonker swim in after them and get stuck in the cave entrance.''
|-
!Mabel
|It's stuck!
|-
!Dipper
|Ha ha! Yeah! Wait...It's stuck? ''(Tries to find a camera but he has none)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Lifts Dipper's hat to reveal he still has one last camera)'' Boop.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Laughs and takes shots of the robot)''
|-
!Mabel
|Didja get a good one?
|-
!Dipper
|THEY'RE ALL GOOD ONES! ''(Hugs her)''
|-
!Mabel
|WOO! HAMSTER BALL!
|-
!
|''The Gobblewonker, still roaring, gets hit by a rock. It's head falls down with an electric noise.''
|-
!Dipper
|What the...?'' (Walks up to the Gobblewonker and touches its side)'' Huh?
|-
!Mabel
|What's wrong?
|-
!
|''Dipper steps on the gobblewonker and knocks it. It makes a hollow metalic sound. Dipper climbs up the Gobblewonker.''
|-
!Soos
|Careful, dude!
|-
!Dipper
|I've got this! Hold on! ''(Climbs over the Gobblewonker, then pops up from the other side)'' Hey, guys! Come check this out!
|-
!
|''The gang discovers a handle and turns it, causing steam to come out. They open the trapdoor causing more steam to come out. They discover old man McGucket inside controlling a machine.''
|-
!McGucket
|Work the bellows and the...Eh? Aww, banjo polish!
|-
!Dipper
|Wha- Yo- You?! You made this? W-w-why?
|-
!McGucket
|Well, I...I, uh...I just wanted attention.
|-
!Dipper
|I still don't understand.
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|Well, first I just hootenannied up a biomechanical brain wave generator, and then I learned to operate a stick-shift with ma beard!
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, yeah. But ''why'' did you do it?
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|Well, when you get to be an old fella like me, nobody pays any attention to you anymore. ''(Flashback of McGucket outside his son's window with a baseball and gloves and his son, inside his office, closing his blinds. Real time, narrating:)'' My own son hasn't visited me in months! ''(Flashback moves to McGucket building the Gobblewonker. Real time, narrating)'' So I figured maybe I'd catch his fancy with a fifteen ton aquatic robut! ''(Laughs like maniac and the flashback ends. Sighs)'' In retrospect, it seems a bit contrived. You just don't know the length us old-timers go through for a little quality time with our family.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Look at the fishing hats Grunkle Stan gave them and sigh)''
|-
!Soos
|Dude. I guess the real lake monster is you two. Heh, heh! Sorry, that just like--boom--just popped into my head there.
|-
!Mabel
|So, did you ever talk to your son about how you felt?
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|No, sir, I got to work straight on the robut! ''(A projector shows blueprints for the Gobblewonker on the trapdoor)'' I made lots of robuts in my day! ''(Pushes button and projectors shows a newspaper with a robot pterodactyl breathing fire on a town and the word "chaos")'' Like when my wife left me and I created a homicidal pterodactyl-tron, ''(Pushed button again and projectors shows a picture of a man)'' or when my pal [[List of unseen characters#Ernie|Ernie]] didn't come to my retirement party ''(Pushed button agains and projector shows another newspaper with a large robot terrorizing a town and the word "disaster")'' and I constructed an eighty ton ''SHAME BOT'' THAT EXPLODED THE ENTIRE DOWNTOWN AREA! ''(Laughs like a maniac)'' Well, time to get back to work on my death ray! ''(Ducks into the Gobblewonker and construction noises can be heard from inside. Raises hand in a grabbing motion)'' Any of you kids got a screwdriver?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes out camera)'' Well, so much for the photo contest.
|-
!Mabel
|You still have one roll of film left.
|-
!Dipper
|Whaddaya wanna do with it?
|-
!
|''Cut back to Stan driving back towards the shore.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Looking defeated, sighs)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! Over here! ''(Drives by on the beat-up S.S. Cool Dude and both boats stop. Takes a photo of Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|What the-- Kids? I thought you two were off playing "Spin the Bottle" with Soos!
|-
!Dipper
|Well, we spent all day trying to find a "legendary" dinosaur.
|-
!Mabel
|But we realized, the only dinosaur we wanna hang out with is right here.
|-
!Stan
|Save your sympathy! I've been having a great time withoutcha'! Makin' friends, talkin' to my reflection-- I had a run-in with the lake police! Guess I gotta wear this ankle bracelet now, so that'll be fun.
|-
!Dipper
|So... I guess there isn't room in that boat for three more?
|-
!Stan
|''(Glares at Dipper and Mabel)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Put on their hats)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Expression softens)'' You knuckleheads ever seen me thread a hook with my eyes closed?
|-
!Dipper
|Five bucks says you can't do it!
|-
!Stan
|You're on! ''(Dipper climbs into the Stanowar)''
|-
!Mabel
|Five more bucks says you can't do it with your eyes closed, ''plus'' me singing at the top of my lungs!
|-
!Stan
|I like those odds!'' (Mabel and Soos climb into the Stanowar; To Soos:)'' Whoa! What happened to your shirt?
|-
!Soos
|Long story, dude.
|-
!Dipper
|All right, everybody get together. Say fishing!
|-
!Mabel and Stan
|Fishing!
|-
!Soos
|''(Steps into the picture, but only his belly shows)'' Dude, am I in the frame?
|-
!
|''Photo montage: The picture of Stan and Mabel smiling and Soos' belly; A picture of Mabel covering Stan's eyes while he peeks and tries to thread a hook; Stan reading jokes while Mabel and Soos laugh; Dipper holding his first fish; Stan posing with his hand in his vest; Stan and Mabel stealing fish from Smabel and her grandfather; Dipper, Mabel, and Stan driving away from the lake police.''
|-
!
|''The gang are on a boat. The boat shakes.''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa!
|-
!Dipper
|What was that?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shrugs)''
|-
!
|''Underwater, a disposable cameras sinks. The real Gobblewonker swims by and eats it.''
|-
!
|''End credits.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Playing ventriloquist with the pelican)'' Who wants to hear a joke?
|-
!Dipper
|''(offscreen)'' Not me.
|-
!Mabel
|''(As pelican:)'' Heh, heh! Yeah, ya do! Here it goes: why did the pelican get kicked out of the restaurant?
|-
!Dipper
|''(offscreen)'' I don't care!
|-
!Mabel
|''(As pelican:)'' 'Cuz he had a very big bill! La la la la! Yuk yuk yuk! Blah blah bloo! Yay! Hurray!

|''The episode opens to [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] in the living room, watching a show on television called [[Duck-tective]]. The shows features a constable and a duck detective standing next to a telephone booth that has limbs of an unseen dead person sticking out. While watching the television program, Mabel knits a new sweater and Dipper eats popcorn from a bowl. Mabel reaches for some popcorn, but Dipper slaps her hand.''
|-
!
|''Cut to TV.''
|-
!Constable
|I'm afraid your services won't be required here, sir. My men have examined the evidence, and this is obviously an accident.
|-
!Duck-tective
|''(Starts quacking, the subtitles read:)'' An accident, constable? Or is it...Murder?!
|-
!Constable
|What?!
|-
!TV announcer
|Duck-tective will return after these messages.
|-
!
|''Cut back to twins.''
|-
!Mabel Pines
|(''Drops her sweater and gasps'') That duck is a genius!
|-
!Dipper Pines
|Eh, it's easier to find clues when you're that close to the ground.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hands on her hips, squinting at Dipper doubtfully) ''Are you saying you could outwit Duck-tective?
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, I have very keen powers of observation. For example, just by smelling your breath, I can tell that you have been eating ''(Sniffs)'' ...an entire tube of toothpaste?!
|-
!Mabel
|(''Her mouth covered in sparkling toothpaste'') It was so sparkly...
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|''(Runs in)'' Hey, dudes, you'll never guess what I found!
|-
!Dipper
|Buried treasure!
|-
!Mabel
|Buried-- (''laughs and pushes Dipper playfully'') Hey, I was gonna say that!
|-
!Soos
|''(Leading the twins to a door)'' So, I was cleaning up, when I found this secret door, hidden behind the wallpaper. It's crazy bonkers creepy! ''(Opens the door)''
|-
!
|''The room is filled with several different wax sculptures.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shining a flashlight around)'' Whoa! It's a secret wax museum!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Fingering Wax Sherlock Holmes) ''They're so life-like.

!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!Stan
|Behold the Gravity Falls [[Wax Museum of Mystery|Wax Museum]]! It was one of our most popular attractions... before I forgot all about it. I got 'em all! [[Wax figures#Wax Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]], [[Wax figures#Wax Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]], ''(Looks at a [[Wax figures#Wax Larry King|wax sculpture of Larry King]]'') some kind of, I don't know, goblin man?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shudders)'' Is anyone else getting the creeps here?
|-
!Stan
|And now for my personal favorite: [[Wax figures#Wax Abraham Lincoln|Wax Abraham Lincoln]], right over-- ''(Looks at the melted glob of wax on the floor, which is under sunlight from the window above it'') Oh! Oh no! Come on, who left the blinds open? [[List of unseen characters#Wax John Wilkes Booth|Wax John Wilkes Booth]], I'm looking in your direction! ''(Bends down and puts finger in wax; sighs)'' How do you fix a wax figure?
|-
!Mabel
|Cheer up, Grunkle Stan. Where's that smile?
|-
!Stan
|Egh.
|-
!Mabel
|Beep, bop, boop! ''(Cheerfully pokes Stan in the face)''
|-
!Stan
|Ow.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry, Grunkle Stan. I'll make you a new wax figure from all this old wax!
|-
!Stan
|You really think you can make one of these puppies?
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, I'm an arts and crafts master. Why do you think I always have this glue gun stuck to my arm? ''(Holds up her arm, which has a glue gun glued to it; shakes her arm)'' Eugh, eugh!
|-
!Stan
|I like your gumption, kid!
|-
!Mabel
|I don't know what that word means, but thank you!

!
|''Cut to Dipper drinking [[Pitt Cola|soda]] and walking towards Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Starts choking on soda)''
|-
!Mabel
|What do you think of my wax figure idea? ''(Shows Dipper a drawing that she sketched in her sketch-book)'' She's part fairy princess, and part ''horse'' fairy princess!
|-
!Dipper
|M..maybe you should carve something from real life.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shows Dipper another sketch that she created)'' Like a [[Waffle Guards|waffle, with big arms]]!
|-
!Dipper
|Y-okay... Or, you know, something else. Like- like someone in your family.
|-
!Stan
|Kids, have you seen my pants? ''(Poses on a briefcase)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Turns around, her eyes become big) ''Oh, muse. You work in mysterious ways.

!Stan
|Why's your sister talking to the ceiling?
|-
!
|''Cut to a montage of Mabel busily working on Wax Stan''.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Moves back to admire her work)'' I think... it needs more glitter.
|-
!Soos
|Agreed. ''(Hands Mabel a bucket of glitter)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Tosses the entire bucket onto the statue)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks in with his pants on but not his shoes)'' I found my pants but now I'm missing my-- ''(Notices Wax Stan)'' Ahhh! ''(Falls over)''
|-
!Mabel
|What do you think?
|-
!Stan
|I think... the [[Wax Museum of Mystery|Wax Museum's]] back in business!
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos leading people to see the grand opening of the Wax Museum. Dipper is working in the stand with Wendy''.
|-
!Dipper
|I can't believe this many people showed up.
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|I know, right? Your uncle probably bribed them or something.
|-
!Dipper
|He bribed me. ''(Holds up dollar)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Holds up a dollar. They both laugh.)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Clears throat over the microphone)'' You all know me, folks! Town darling, "Mr. Mystery." Please, ladies, control yourselves!
|-
!
|''Cut to three women in the audience staring blankly ahead, flies swarming around them.''
|-
!Stan
|As you know, I always bring the people of this fair town novelties and befuddlements, the likes of which the world, has never known. But enough about me. Behold... me! ''(Uncovers Wax Stan)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Makes a fanfare sound on his keyboard, then makes a "Ye-ah! Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah!" sound)''
|-
!
|''Two people in the audience politely clap and someone coughs.''
|-
!Stan
|And now a word from our own Mabelangelo!
|-
!Mabel
|It's Mabel. ''(Takes microphone)'' Thank you for coming! I made this sculpture with my own two hands! ''(Throws up her arms) ''It's covered in my blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids!
|-
!Audience
|Ugh! Ewwww!
|-
!Mabel
|(''Chuckles'') Yeah. I will now take questions! ''(Points to [[Old Man McGucket|McGucket]])'' You there!
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|Old Man McGucket, local kook. Are the wax figures alive? And follow-up question, can I survive the wax-man uprising?
|-
!Mabel
|Um...Yes! Next question! ''(Points to [[Toby Determined]])''
|-
!Toby Determined
|''(Holding a turkey baster as if it is a microphone)'' Toby Determined, ''[[Gravity Falls Gossiper]]''. Do you really think this constitutes a wonder of the world?
|-
!Stan
|Your microphone's a turkey baster, Toby.
|-
!Toby 
|It certainly is--
|-
!Stan
|Next question. ''(Points to [[Shandra Jimenez]])''
|-
!Shandra Jimenez
|Shandra Jimenez, a ''real'' reporter. Your flyers promised free pizza with admission to this event. ''Shows flyer'' Is this true?
|-
!Audience members
|That's what I heard! ... Come on! ... What a rip-off! ... Pizza? ... I want my pizza!..
|-
!Stan
|That was a typo. Good night, everyone! ''(Uses a smoke bomb to escape, taking the admission fee with him)''

|-
!Stan
|Hot pumpkin pie! Look at all this cash! And I owe it all to one person, this guy! ''(Points to Wax Stan)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Jokingly punches Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|Ooh! ''(Noogying her)'' Yeah, you too, ya little gremlin. Now you kids wash up. We got another long day of fleecing rubes tomorrow. Go, go! ''(Sighs)'' Kids.
|-
!
|''Cut to TV.''
|-
!Constable
|Well, duck-tective, it seems you've really ''quacked'' the case.
|-
!Duck detective
|''(Quacking; subtitles read:)'' Don't patronize me.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs)'' Stupid duck! Well, I'm gonna use the john. You need anything? ''(Laughs)'' I love this guy! Don't you go nowhere.

|Wax Stan! He's been... m-murdered! ''(Clock bongs three times)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Faints)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan explaining the situation to the police officers.''
|-
!Stan
|I got up to use the john, right? And when I come back, blammo! He's headless!
|-
!Mabel
|My expert handcrafting... besmirched. ''(Crying)'' Besmiiiirrrched!
|-
!Dipper
|Who would do something like this?
|-
![[Deputy Durland]]
|What's your opinion, [[Sheriff Blubs]]?
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Look, we'd love to help you folks, but let's face the facts... this case is unsolvable.
|-
!Dipper, Mabel and Stan
|What?!
|-
!Stan
|You take that back, Sheriff Blubs!
|-
!Dipper
|You're kidding, right? There must be evidence, motives. You know, I could help if you want.
|-
!Mabel
|He's really good. He figured out who was eating our tin cans!
|-
!Dipper
|All signs pointed to the goat.
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, yeah! Let the boy help. He's got a little brain up in his head.
|-
!Blubs
|Oooh! Would you look at what we got here! City boy thinks he's gonna solve a mystery with his fancy computer phone!
|-
!Durland
|City boooy! City ''booooooy''!
|-
!Blubs
|You are adorable!
|-
!Dipper
|Adorable?
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Blubs
|Look, P.J.'s, how about you leave the investigating to the grown-ups, okay?
|-
!Man
|''(Over Blub's walkie talkie:)'' Attention, all units. Steve is about to fit an entire cantaloupe in his mouth. Repeat, an entire cantaloupe!
|-
!Durland
|It's a 23-16!
|-
!Blubs
|Let's move!
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|''(Run off laughing)''
|-
!Dipper
|That's it! Mabel, you and me are going to find the jerk who did this, and get back that head. Then we'll see who's adorable. ''(Sneezes)''
|-
!Mabel
|Aww, you sneeze like a kitten! ''(Dipper glares at her)''
|-
!
|''Commercial break''
|-
!
|''Cut to the next morning. Dipper and Mabel are studying the crime scene.''
|-
!Dipper
|Wax Stan has lost his head and its up to us to find it.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Takes pictures)''
|-
!Dipper
|There were a lot of unhappy customers at the unveiling. ''(Looks at the bulletin board with pictures of suspects) ''The murderer could have been anyone.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah! Even us!
|-
!Dipper
|In this [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|town]], anything is possible. [[Ghosts]], [[The Undead|zombies]], it could be months before we find our first clue.
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, look! A clue.
|-
!
|''There are shoeprints in the carpet.''
|-
!Dipper
|Footprints in the shag carpet!
|-
!Mabel
|That's weird. They've got a hole in them.
|-
!Dipper
|And they're leading to...
|-
!
|''There's an ax on the floor.''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|(''Gasp, then look at each other)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the twins in the gift shop with Soos.''
|-
!Dipper
|So, what do you think?
|-
!Soos
|In my opinion: this is an ax.
|-
!Mabel
|Wait a minute. The lumberjack!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Of course!
|-
!
|''Flashback to Manly Dan punching the pole.''
|-
!Manly Dan
|In your ''face!''
|-
!
|''Back in the present.''
|-
!Dipper
|He was ''furious'' when he didn't get that free pizza.
|-
!Mabel
|Furious enough, for ''murder!''
|-
!Soos
|Oh, you mean Manly Dan. Yeah, he hangs out at this crazy intense biker joint downtown.
|-
!Mabel
|Then ''that's'' where we're going.
|-
!Soos
|Dude, this is awesome. You two are like: The Mystery Twins!
|-
!Dipper
|Don't call us that.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Walk outside)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Pulling a coffin out of his car)'' Hey, give me a hand with this coffin, will ya? I'm doin' a memorial service for wax Stan. Something small, but classy. ''(Pulls the coffin out of the car)''
|-
!Dipper
|Sorry, Grunkle Stan, but we have got a big break in the case!
|-
!Mabel
|Break in the case!
|-
!Dipper
|We're heading to the town right now to interrogate the murderer.
|-
!Mabel
|We have an axe! ''(''Shows Stan the ax in Dipper's bag; Making a horror movie screeching sound:'') ''REE, REE, REE!
|-
!Stan
|Hm, seems like the kind of thing that responsible parents wouldn't want you to do... Good thing I'm an uncle. Avenge me kids! AVENGE MEEE!!
|-
!
|''Cut to the town, Dipper and Mabel are sneaking behind a dumpster near the [[Skull Fracture]]''.
|-
!Dipper
|This is the place. ''(Gasp when [[Tats]] looks at him)'' Got the fake IDs?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gives him one)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looking at ID)'' Here goes nothing.
|-
!Tats
|''(Looks at an ID card)'' Sorry, but we don't serve miners.
|-
![[Unnamed miner|Miner]]
|Daaaannnnng'nab it! ''(Spits on the road and walks off) Eughh!''
|-
!Mabel
|''(She and Dipper walk up)'' We're here to interrogate Manly Dan the lumber jack for the murder of wax Stan. ''(She and Dipper show their fake ID cards; Mabel jingles hers)'' Dedledle-e.
|-
!Tats
|Works for me. ''(Opens door for the twins)''
|-
!
|''Men are fighting inside the Skull Fracture. Dipper and Mabel walk inside and look around. Dipper motions for Mabel to follow him.''
|-
!Mabel
|(''Walks over a body'') He's resting.
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, let's just try to blend in, ok?
|-
!Mabel
|You got it, Dippingsauce. ''(Climbs onto a chair and talks to a man)'' Hey there, fellow restaurant patron! ''(Pats his arm)'' Bap!
|-
![[Bats Biker|Biker]]
|''(Growls)''
|-
!Manly Dan
|''(Playing an arm wrestling game)'' AAAAAGHHHH!!
|-
!Dipper
|Manly Dan, just the guy I wanted to see. Where were you last night?
|-
!Manly Dan
|Punchin' the clock.
|-
!Dipper
|You were at work.
|-
!Manly Dan
|No, I was punchin' that clock! ''(Points to a broken clock outside)''
|-
!Dipper
|10 o'clock, the time of the murder. So, I guess you've never seen ''this'' before? ''(Pulls out the axe from his bag and shows Manly Dan)''
|-
!Manly Dan
|Listen, little girl!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, actually I'm a--
|-
!Manly Dan
|I wouldn't pick my teeth with that ax. It's left handed! I only use my right hand, the MANLY HAND!! ''(Rips the machine's arm off and beats the machine with it)''
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|Get 'im! Get 'im! ''(Giggles)''
|-
!Dipper
|Left handed...
|-
!Mabel and Biker
|''(Looking at cootie catcher Mabel is counting off with)'' 3, 4, 5, 6.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Your wife is gonna be beautiful.
|-
!Biker
|''(Pumps arm) ''Yes!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, big break in the case!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Leave)''
|-
!Biker
|But will she love me?!
|-
!Dipper
|It's a left handed ax. ''(Shows her a list)'' These are all our suspects. Manly Dan is right handed, that means all we have to do is find our left handed suspect and we've got our killer.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh man, we are on ''fire'' today! Pa-zow, Pa-zow, Pa-zow!
|-
!Dipper
|Let's find that murderer. ''(Fist bumps Mabel)''
|-
!
|''Montage: cut to Mabel waving at McGucket. He has a baby alligator on his right hand as he waves back to her. Dipper lists McGucket as right handed. Cut to Dipper wearing a fake mustache and carrying a package to Pizza Guy's house. Pizza Man signs Dipper's form and gets excited, only for Dipper to take the package and leave. He is listed as right handed. Cut to Mabel whistling to the Angry Lady and throwing her a baseball. She catches it with her right hand and crushes it. She is listed as right handed. Cut to the twins at Mikey R.'s house. He comes to the door with both hands in casts. His name is just crossed out. Cut to name after name being listed as right handed until the tip of the pencil breaks.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)'' Mabel, there's only one person left on this list.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Of course, it all adds up!
|-
!
|''The cops and kids go to Gravity Falls Gossiper.''
|-
!Blubs
|You kids better be right about this or you'll never get the end of it.
|-
!Dipper
|The evidence is irrefutable.
|-
!Mabel
|It's ''so'' irrefutable.
|-
!Durland
|I gonna get to use my match stick!
|-
!Blubs
|You ready? You ready little fella?
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|Woo, woo! ''(Both poke each other with their police batons)''
|-
!Dipper
|On 3! 1, 2, ...
|-
!Durland
|''(Smashes the door open)'' Yaaaahhhh!
|-
!Blubs
|Nobody move! This is a raid!
|-
!Toby 
|Aaaahh! ''(Falls down)'' What is this? Some kind of raid?
|-
!Durland
|''(Smashes a lamp)'' Derp!
|-
!Dipper
|Toby Determined, you're under arrest for murder of the wax body of Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Mabel
|You have the right to remain impressed with our awesome detective work. ''(High fives Dipper)''
|-
!Toby
|Gobbling goose feathers! I don't understand!
|-
!Dipper
|Then allow me to explain. ''(Flashback to the event; voiceover:)'' You were hoping that Grunkle Stan's new attraction would be the story that saved your failing newspaper. But when the show was a flop, you decided to go out and make your own headline. ''(In the flashback, Toby chops Wax Stan's head off)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holding a newspaper with a picture of Wax Stan's head)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flashback shows Toby's shoe with a hole in it and his turkey baster held in his left hand; voiceover:)'' But you were sloppy, and all the clues pointed to a shabby shoed reporter who was caught left handed.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Crumples up newspaper)'' Toby Determined, you're yesterday's news.
|-
!Toby
|Boy, your little knees must be sore... from ''jumping'' to conclusions. (''Dances'') Hachacha! I had nothing to do with that murder.
|-
!Dipper
|I knew it! (Overlapping with Mabel) Wait, what did you say? Nothing? You say nothing?
|-
!Mabel
|Huh? What? Could you repeat?
|-
!Blubs
|Then where were you at the night of the break-in?
|-
!Toby
|Ehh... ''(Inserts a tape into a TV. It starts playing, and we see him taking a cardboard cutout of Shandra Jimenez out of his closet)'' Finally, we can be alone, cardboard cutout of TV news reporter Shandra Jimenez! ''(Kisses it)''
|-
!Cops and kids
|Eeeewwww! Yuck!
|-
!Blubs
|Timestamp confirms. Toby, you're off the hook. You freak of nature.
|-
!Toby
|Hooray!
|-
!Dipper
|But, but it has to be him! Check the ax for fingerprints!
|-
!Blubs
|''(Checks for finger print on the ax)'' No prints at all.
|-
!Dipper
|No prints?
|-
!Durland
|Hey I got a headline for you: city kids waste everyone's time.
|-
!Adults
|(''Laugh)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Look at each other, embarrassed)''
|-
!Toby
|''(As the video of him kissing the cutout of Shandra Jimenez continues to play) ''Boy, I'd be pretty embarrassed if I was you two.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan in the wax figure room. He is standing on a stage with a bunch of chairs set up. Dipper, Mabel, Soos, and the wax figures are the audience.''
|-
!Stan
|Kids, Soos, lifeless wax figures, thank you all for coming.
|-
!Soos
|''(Blows nose, crying)''
|-
!Stan
|Some people might say it's wrong for a man to love a wax replica of himself.
|-
!Soos
|''(Jumps up and points)'' They're wrong!
|-
!Stan
|Easy Soos. Wax Stan, I hope you're picking pockets in wax heaven. ''(Wipes eye) ''I'm sorry, I got glitter in my eye! ''(Cries and runs away)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Running after Stan, while crying:)'' Ohhhhh duuuude...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' Those cops are right about me.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, we've come so far, we can't give up now.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Stands up and walk to the coffin)'' But I considered everything: the weapon, the motive, the clues ''(Looks inside coffin; sighs)'' Wax Stan's shoe has a hole in it...
|-
!Mabel
|All the wax guys have that. It's where the pole thingy attaches to their stand dealy.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait a minute, what has a hole on its shoe and no fingerprints? Mabel! The murderers are--
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Standing right behind you.
|-
!
|''All the wax figures come to life.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasp)'' Wax Sherlock Holmes! Wax Shakespeare! [[Wax figures#Wax Coolio|Wax Coolio]]?
|-
!Wax Coolio

!Mabel
|Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Congratulations, my two amuetur slueths, you have unburied the truth, and now we're going to bury you.
|-
!
|''Commercial break.''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Bravo, Dipper Pines. You've discovered our little secret. (''Takes wax Stan's head out of his cape) ''Applaud, everyone, applaud sarcastically.
|-
!Wax figures
|''(Applaud)''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Uh, no that sounds too sincere. Slow clap.
|-
!Wax figures
|''(Slow clap)''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|There we go, nice and condescending.
|-
!Dipper
|But... how is this possible? You're made of wax!
|-
!Mabel
|Are you... ''magic?''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Laughs)'' Are we magic? She wants to know if we're magic! ''(Stops laughing)'' We're CURSED!
|-
!Wax Figures
|Cursed! Cursed!
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Cursed to come to life whenever the moon is waxing. Your uncle bought us many years ago at a garage sale.
|-
!Wax Coolio
|A ''haunted'' garage sale, son!
|-
!
|''Flashback to the haunted garage sale.''
|-
!Seller
|I must warn you, these statues come at a terrible price.
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at price tag)'' Twenty dollars?! I'll just take 'em when you're not lookin'.
|-
!Seller
|What?
|-
!Stan
|I said I was gonna rob you.
|-
!
|''Flashback showing the wax museum during the day.''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Voiceover:)'' And so, the Mystery Shack Wax Collection was born. By day, we would be the playthings of man.
|-
!Wax Coolio
|''(Voiceover:)'' But when your uncle went to sleep, we would rule da night.
|-
!
|''Flashback shows the statues messing around the Mystery Shack at night.''
|-
!Wax Larry King
|''(Flicks Coolio's braids)''
|-
!Wax Coolio
|Hey, I told you to stop that.
|-
!Wax Larry King
|Make me!
|-
!
|''Cut to Wax Holmes and [[Wax figures#Wax Edgar Allen Poe|Wax Edgar Allen Poe]] in Stan's room while he's sleeping. Laughing, they take a photo.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Wakes up)'' Huh?
|-
!
|''Wax Holmes and Poe freeze when Stan wakes up.''
|-
!Stan
|Eh. ''(Returns to sleep)''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Voiceover:)'' It was a charmed life for us cursed beings...
|-
!
|''Flashback to Stan shaking the empty admission box and putting the wax figures in storage''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Voiceover:)'' That is, until your uncle closed up shop.
|-
!
|''The storage room is seen wearing out as time goes by, leaving the door blocked by wallpaper. Soos later comes by sweeping the floor and finds the knob to the storage room. He puts the knob back in its place. Dissolve to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Voiceover:)'' We've been waiting ten years to get our revenge on Stan for locking us away...
|-
!
|''Flashback to Wax Sherlock Holmes swipes Wax Stan's head off with an ax.''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Voiceover:)'' But we got the wrong guy.
|-
!
|''In the flashback, Stan grumbles and spits as he begins to enter and Wax Sherlock Holmes slips out; the flashback ends''
|-
!Dipper
|So, ''you're'' trying to murder Grunkle Stan for real?!
|-
!Mabel
|You were right all along, Dipper! Wax people ''are'' creepy!
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Enough! Now that you know our secret, you must... ''die''.
|-
!
|''The wax figures growl and their eyes roll back in their heads. The approach the kids.''
|-
!Mabel
|What do we do, what do we do?
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Throw stuff on a table behind them at the wax figures)''

!Dipper
|''(Throws a full coffee maker at them)''
|-
!Wax Genghis Khan
|''(Coffee all over him, he is melting; Screams)''

!Mabel
|That's it! We can melt them with hotty melty things!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel

|-
!Dipper
|
Anyone move and we'll melt you into candles!
|-
!Mabel
|Decorative candles!
|-
!Wax Holmes
|You really think you can defeat us?
|-
!Dipper
|I-I don't really know. I'm not-I'm not really sure.
|-
!Mabel
|It's worth a shot, I guess.
|-
!Wax Holmes
|So be it... ''(To wax figures:) ''attack!

!
|''The figures begin closing in on the twins. Wax Lizzie Borden swings her ax at Mabel, but accidently decapitates [[Wax figures#Wax Robin Hood|Wax Robin Hood]]. Mabel walks around her, but [[Wax figures#Wax Shakespeare|Wax Shakespeare]] sneaks up behind her. Mabel cuts off his hands with the candles, and he runs away. Wax Shakespeare's hands still move, and begin strangling Mabel. Mabel walks over to a door, and repeatably smashes it on its fingers''

![[Wax figures#Wax Groucho Marx|Wax Groucho Marx]]
|''(Touches candle and his his hand begins to melt)'' Eh!
|-
!Dipper
|Jokes on you, Groucho! ''(Cuts Groucho in half using candle)''
|-
!Wax Groucho Marx
|''(As the top half of his body slides off of the lower half)'' I've heard about a cutting remark but this is ridiculous! Hey, why is there nothing in my hand?
|-
!Wax Genghis Khan
|(''Runs at Dipper, but Dipper dodges and he runs right into the fireplace)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha, Genghis Khan! You fell harder than the... uh... I don't know, uh, Jin Dynasty? Heh. Yeah. Alright. (''Gets up and runs back into the fight'')
|-
!Mabel
|(''Swings around Wax Coolio's head while getting overwhelmed by wax figures'')
|-
!Wax Coolio
|Ow ow ow ow! What's up with that?

!Mabel
|Dipper! Watch out!

|(''Cuts Wax Richard Nixon's leg; causes Nixon to be pushed into next room and sees Wax Sherlock Holmes approach him'')
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Alright. Let's get this taken care of. (''Puts Wax Stan's head on the horn of a rhino on the wall, and grabs a sword hanging on the wall. He then swings it at Dipper, smacking the candle out of his hand, and breaking it. He swings the sword above his head, and aims it at Dipper'')

!Mabel
|Catch! (''Throws a poker to Dipper'')
|-
!
|''Wax Holmes brings the sword on Dipper, but is blocked with the poker. Wax Sherlock keeps attacking, while Dipper blocks and is pushed back. Dipper is pushed back into the Attic Floor, and is cornered by Wax Holmes against the wall''.

!Wax Holmes
|Come back here, you brat!

!
|''Dipper climbs onto the Mystery Shack sign and Wax Holmes follows him. Dipper slowly walks across it, while Wax Holmes swings the sword at him. They clash between poker and sword while trying to maintain balance. Wax Holmes tries to hit Dipper with its sword, but Dipper jumps back, and the "S" in "Shack" falls off.''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|You really think you can outwit me boy? I'm Sherlock bleeding Holmes! Have you seen my magnifying glass?! It's enormous!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Drops the poker and begins to climbs off the sign, and behind it. He hides behind the chimney and looks out to see is Wax Sherlock is there)''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Kicks him down. Raises sword)'' Any last words?
|-
!Dipper
|Um... you got any sunscreen?
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Got any--? What? ''(Turns and sees the sun starting to rise; Gasps)'' No. ''(Begins to melt)''
|-
!Dipper
|You know, letting me lead you outside? Probably not you sharpest decision.
|-
!Wax Holmes
|''(Continues to melt)'' Outsmarted by a child in short pants! No! ''(Starts melting faster)'' Fiddlesticks! Humbugs! Tiiter, total kerfuffle. Butter hallabaloo. ''(Everything but his face melts)''
|-
!Dipper
|Case closed! ''(Wipes hands together; the dust makes him sneeze)''
|-
!Wax Holmes
|Ha ha ha! You sneeze like a kitten! Those policemen were right, you're adorable! Adorable! ''(Falls off the roof and then splashes)''
|-
!Dipper
|E-ew.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel throwing the remaining parts of the wax figures into the fireplace. Wax Shakespeare's head is the only noticeable wax figure left.''

!Wax Shakespeare
|Though our group be left in twain, man of wax shall rise agayn!

|-
!Wax Shakespeare
|Uh... there once was a dude from Kentucky...
|-
!Mabel
|Nope! ''(Throws his head into the fire)''
|-
!
|''Dipper enters.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! You're okay! You solved the mystery after all.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pulls up a chair and takes Wax Stan's head off the wall)'' I couldn't have done it without my sidekick.
|-
!Mabel
|No offense Dipper, but you're the sidekick.
|-
!Dipper
|What? Says who? Have people been saying that? Have you heard that?
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks in)'' Hot Belgian waffles!! What happened to my parlor!?
|-
!Mabel
|Your wax figures turned out to be evil, so we fought them to the death!
|-
!Dipper
|I decapitated Larry King.
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha! You kids and your imaginations!
|-
!Dipper
|On the bright side, though, look what we found. ''(Hands Stan Wax Stan's head)''
|-
!Stan
|My head! Ha ha! I missed this guy! You done good kids! Alright, line up for some affectionate noogie-ing.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh I'm not so sure about that. Is there any other alternative...?

!Stan
|Ha ha! ''(Noogies Dipper and Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel and Dipper
|''(Laugh)''

!
|''Blubs and Durland drive up to the window.''
|-
!Blubs
|Solved the case yet, boy? I'm so confident you're gonna say no, that I'm gonna take a long, slow sip from my cup of coffee. ''(Takes a long, slow sip)''
|-
!Dipper
|Actually, the answer is yes.
|-
!Blubs
|Blu blu blu-- ''(Spits coffee in Durland's face)''
|-
!Durland

|-
!Stan, Dipper, and Mabel
|(''Laugh'')
|-
!Stan
|They got scalded!
|-
!
|''A crash is heard.''
|-
!Dipper
|So, did you get rid of all the wax figures?
|-
!Mabel
|I am ninety-nine percent sure that I did!
|-
!Dipper
|Good enough for me!
|-
!
|''The camera moves over to a vent and we see Wax Larry King's head.''
|-
!Wax Larry King
|''(Laughs)'' --Huh?
|-
!Rat
|''(Walks up to him)''
|-
!Wax Larry King
|So you're a rat. Tell me about that.

!
|''Cut to credits.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hmm. Hey Dipper, which do you think is better? Sequins or llama hair?
|-
!Wax Larry King
|''(Hops to the vent next to her)'' The llama hair. Llamas are nature's greatest warriors. ''(Hops off)''
|-
!Mabel
|Thanks Dipper!

!Actor
|''(While crying:)'' YES!
|-
!Bud 
|''(Voice-over:)'' Then you need to meet ''(In a whisper:)'' [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]].
|-
!Dipper Pines
|Gideon?
|-
!Mabel Pines
|What makes him so special?
|-
!Bud
|''(Voice-over:)'' He's a psychic.
|-

|-
!Mabel
|Wow, I'm getting all curiousy inside!
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks in)'' Well, don't get too curiousy. Ever since that monster Gideon rolled into town, I've had nothin' but trouble.
|-
!
|''Cut to Grunkle Stan driving in a parking lot. He spots an open parking spot and attempts to back in, but Gideon's tour bus pulls in first.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Makes a fist)'' Gideon!
|-
!
|''Cut back to present.''
|-
!Mabel
|Well, is he really psychic?
|-
!Dipper
|I think we should go and find out.
|-
!Stan
|Never! You're forbidden from patronizing the competition. No one that lives under my roof is allowed under that Gideon's roof!
|-
!Dipper
|Do tents have roofs?
|-
!Mabel
|I think we just found our loop hole... literally! ''(Holds up a string with a loop in it)'' Mwop mwop!

!
|''Crowd mutters several positive things about the sack's credibility.''

|-
!
|''Dipper points to a maintenance worker who looks very similar to Soos, named [[Deuce]]. Soos glares at the lookalike while munching on an empanada.''

|-
!Gideon Gleeful
|Hello America! My name is Li'l Gideon.
|-
!
|''Gideon claps and doves fly out of his hair. The crowd cheers.''
|-
!Dipper
|That's Stan's mortal enemy?
|-
!Mabel
|But he's so wittle!
|-
!Gideon
|Ladies and gentlemen, it is such a gift to have you here tonight! ...Such a gift. I have a ''vision''. I predict that you will soon all say, "aww."

Come on, everybody, rise up! I want y'all to keep it going!

!Gideon
|Keep it going!<br />

''Something tells me you're named Mabel''
|-
!
|''Gideon leaves, and Mabel faces the screen and moves the popcorn out of the way so that we can see her sweater, which reads "MABEL."''
|-
!Mabel
|How'd he do that?
|-
!Gideon
|''(Singing:)'' ''So welcome all ye... to the Tent of Telepathy<br />''
And thanks for visiting... ''widdle ol' me!''
|-
!
|The song ends, Gideon is sweating and panting and the crowd cheers wildly.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Pants)'' Oh... oh my goodness. ''(Drinks some water; to the audience:)'' Thank you! You people are the real miracles!
|-
!Mabel
|Woo! Yeah!
|-
!Dipper
|''(As they exit)'' Man, that kid's an even bigger fraud than Stan! No wonder our uncle's jealous.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, come on. His dance moves were adorable! And did you see his hair? It was like, whoosh!
|-
!Dipper
|You're too easily impressed.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, yeah!
|-
!
|''Next day at the Mystery Shack. Mabel goes up to Dipper, her face is bedazzled with sequins.''
|-
!Mabel
|Check it out, Dipper! I successfully bezazzled my face! Blink! ''(She blinks as she says this and some of the sequins fly off her face)'' Ow.
|-
!Dipper
|Is that permanent?
|-
!Mabel
|I'm unappreciated in my time...
|-
!
|''The doorbell rings.''
|-
!Stan
|Somebody answer that door!!
|-
!Mabel
|I'll get it! ''(Goes to get the door. She opens it up but there thinks is no one there. Mabel then looks down and finds Gideon)''
|-
!Gideon
|Howdy.
|-
!Mabel
|It's "wittle ol'" you!
|-
!Gideon
|''(Laughs nervously)'' Yeah, my song's quite catchy. Now, I know we haven't formally met, but after yesterday's performance, I just couldn't get your laugh out of my head.
|-
!Mabel
|You mean this one? ''(Laughs obnoxiously)''
|-
!Gideon
|Oh, what a delight! Now, when I saw you in the audience, I said to myself, "Now there's a kindred spirit! Someone who appreciates the sparkly things in life."
|-
!Mabel
|That's totally me! ''(Laughs and coughs up some sequins that land on Gideon's suit, bedazzling it)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(In a whisper:)'' Enchanting. Utterly enchanting.
|-
!Stan
|''(Offscreen)'' Who's at the door?
|-
!Mabel
|No one, Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Gideon
|I appreciate your discretion. Now, Stan's no fan of mine. I don't know how a lemon so sour could be related to a peach so sweet.
|-
!Mabel
|Gideon! Aha ha!
|-
!Gideon
|What do you say we step away from here, and chat a bit more. Perhaps in my dressing room?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh! Makeovers. Yahoo! ''(Pokes Gideon's stomach)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Laughs)'' Ow.
|-
!
|''Cut to inside Gideon's house. Gideon opens the door to his dressing room. Mabel stares in amazement.''
|-
!Gideon
|Ya see something you like? 'Cause I do.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs; cluelessly:)'' What?
|-
!
|''Mabel returns to the Mystery Shack with her makeover.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey Dipper. What's goin' oooon? ''(Dangles manicured fingernails over Dipper's head)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa, where have you been? And what's going on with those fingernails, you look like a wolverine.
|-
!Mabel
|I know, right? ''(Roars, pretends to scratch something)'' I was hanging out with my new pal, Gideon. He is one dapper little man.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, I don't trust anyone whose hair is bigger than their head.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, leave him alone! You never want to do girly stuff with me; you and Soos get to do boy stuff all the time!
|-
!Dipper
|What do you mean?
|-
!Soos
|''(Enters)'' Hey dude, you ready to blow up these hot dogs in the microwave one by one?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Excitedly:)'' Am I! ''(They both run off while Mabel stands there)''
|-
!Dipper and Soos
|''(Offscreen, as popping sounds are made, they are heard laughing)'' ''(Chanting:)'' One-at-a-time! One-at-a-time!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Gideon on the roof of a [[412 Gopher Road|warehouse]].''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, the view from your family's factory is nuts! Good thing we both brought our—
|-
!Mabel and Gideon
|—Opera glasses! ''(Point their opera glasses at each other and laugh)''
|-
!Gideon
|Mabel, when I'm up here lookin' down on all those little ol' people, I feel like I'm king of all I survey. I guess that makes you my queen!
|-
!Mabel
|What? You are being so nice to me right now, quit it! ''(smacks him in the stomach)''
|-
!Gideon
|I can't quit it. I am speaking from the heart.
|-
!Mabel
|From the where-now?
|-
!Gideon
|Mabel, I've never felt this close with anyone. So, so close. ''(Strokes Mabel's hair and giggles)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pushes his hand away)'' Look Gideon, I um...
|-
!Gideon
|''(Reaches to pet Mabel's hair again and giggles)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pushes his hand away)'' I like you a lot, but let's just be friends.
|-
!Gideon
|At least just give me a chance. Mabel, will you do me the honor of going on a date with me?
|-
!Mabel
|A play date?
|-
!Gideon
|''(Shakes head)'' Mmnn.
|-
!Mabel
|A shopping date?
|-
!Gideon
|Mmnn. It'll just be one li'l ol' date, I swear on my lucky bolo tie.
|-
!Mabel
|Ummm. Okay, then... I guess...
|-
!Gideon
|Mabel Pines, you have made me the happiest boy in the world! ''(Hugs Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|Are you sniffing my hair?
|-
!
|''Cut to commercial break.''
|-
!
|''Back at Mystery Shack, Mabel and Dipper are playing a video game.''
|-
!Mabel
|It's not a date-date, it's just, you know, I didn't want to hurt his feelings and so I figured I'd throw him a bone.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, guys don't work that way. He's gonna fall in love with you.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Scoffs)'' Yeah right. I'm not ''that'' lovable. ''(Shoots Dipper in the game)'' Kaboom! Yes!
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, we agree on something here.
|-
!
|''Doorbell rings, Mabel goes to answer door. A horse busts through.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Screams)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Riding horse)'' A night of enchantment awaits, m'lady!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh boy.
|-
!
|''Cut to an [[Aquatic restaurant|aquatic themed restaurant]], and then to the interior. Mabel and Gideon are sitting together at a booth.''
|-
!Mabel
|I can't believe they let us bring a horse in here!
|-
!Gideon
|Well, people have a hard time saying ''no'' to me. ''(Puts feet up on table)''
|-
![[Jean-Luc]]
|Ah, Monsieur Gideon! Ze feet on ze table! An excellent choice!
|-
!Gideon
|Jean Luc, what did we discuss about eye contact?
|-
!Waiter
|''(Looking away)'' Yes, yes, very good! ''(Backs away)''
|-
!Mabel
|I've never seen so many forks! And water with bubbles in it? ''Ooh lala, oui, oui!''
|-
!Gideon
|Oh! ''Parlez vous francais?!''
|-
!Mabel
|...I have no idea what you're saying.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack gift shop, where Stan is looking at a newspaper article showing a picture of Gideon and Mabel together.''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, hey! What the jackal is Mabel doing in the paper next to that crazy pickpocket Gideon?
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|Oh, yeah, it's like a big deal. Everybody's talking about Gideon and Mabel's big date tonight.
|-
!Stan
|WHAT?! That little shyster is dating my great niece!?
|-
!Soos
|I wonder what the new name will be for the power couple. Mabideon? Gideabel? ''(Gasps)'' Magidbeleon!
|-
!Stan
|''(Exits)''
|-
!Dipper
|I didn't know! I didn't hear about it and plus, I told her not to.
|-
!Stan
|''(Re-enters, wearing his suit)'' Yeah, well it ends tonight. I'm going right down to that little skunk's house; this is gonna stop RIGHT now! ''(Slams door)''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, wouldn't it be funny if that was a closet, and he had to come back out again and go out the real door? ''(Opens the door)'' Nope. Real door.
|-
!
|''Stan's car skids to a halt in front of Gideon's house. He drives his [[Stanmobile|car]] up to Gideon's house and skids to a halt in front. ''
|-
!Stan
|(He knocks the door) Gideon, you little punk! Open up! ''(He reads sign on the door that says "Please Pardon This Garden")'' I will pardon NOTHING!
|-
!Bud
|''(Opens the door)'' Why, Stanford Pines! What a delight!
|-
!Stan
|Out of the way Bud, I'm looking for Gideon!
|-
!Bud
|Well, I haven't seen the boy around, but since you're here, you simply ''must'' come in for coffee! ''(Pulls Stan inside)''
|-
!Stan
|But-but I came-
|-
!Bud
|It's imported! All the way from Colombia!
|-
!Stan
|Wow... I went to jail there once. ''(Whistles)'' Some digs you got here. ''(Sees clown painting)'' Oh, this. This is beautiful.
|-
!Bud
|Now, I hear that your niece and my Gideon are, well, they're singin' in harmony lately so to speak!
|-
!Stan
|Uh, yeah, and I'm against it. Nyah. ''(Knocks a pillow off the couch)''
|-
!Bud
|No no no. I see it as a fantastic business opportunity. Yes, the Mystery Shack and the Tent of Telepathy. We've been at each other's throats for far too- lemme get that. ''(Rips down a picture of Stan on a dart board)'' We've been at each other's throats for far too long, yes we have. This is our big chance to set aside our rivalry and pool our collective profit, you see.
|-
!Stan
|''(Clicks a cash register)'' I'm listening.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Gideon and Mabel in The Club.''
|-
!Gideon
|...And so I said "Autograph your own head shot lady." ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Nervously laughs)'' Yeah... ''(The lobster on her plate pinches her fork)''
|-
!Gideon
|Mabel, tonight's date was a complete success. And tomorrow's date promises to top this one in every way!
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa whoa, you said just ''one'' date, and this was it.
|-
!Gideon
|Hark! What a surprise! A red crested South American rainbow macaw!
|-
!Macaw
|''(Flies in and lands on Gideon)''
|-
!Mabel

!Chef
|Gideon's got a girlfriend.
|-
!Gideon
|They're expectin' us. Please say you'll go.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, Gideon, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to say-
|-
!Blubs
|I'm on the edge of my seat.
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|This is gonna be adorable.
|-
![[Unnamed librarian|Old Woman]]
|If she say's no, I'll die from sadness.
|-
![[Unnamed doctor|Doctor]]
|I can verify that that will indeed happen.
|-
!
|''People chattering.''
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Shack. Mabel walks by Dipper as he's reading his book.''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey. How'd it go?
|-
!Mabel
|I don't know... ''(Puts lobster in tank)'' I have a lobster now.
|-
!Dipper
|Well, at least it's over and you'll never have to go out with him again. ''(Pause)'' Mabel? It's over, right? Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|BLAARRGG! ''(Flails arms)'' He asked me out again and I didn't know how to say no.
|-
!Dipper
|Like this: no.
|-
!Mabel
|It's not that easy, Dipper! And I do like Gideon, as a friend slash little sister, so I didn't want to hurt his feelings! I just need to get things back to where they used to be. You know, friends.
|-
!
|''Out at night in the middle of the lake. [[Old Man McGucket]] is rowing a boat with Gideon and Mabel in it.''
|-
!McGucket
|Boat in the night! Boat in the night! ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hah, you know I thought dancing was gonna be the end of the evening, right?
|-
!Gideon
|''(Leans in)'' Don't you want this evenin' to last, my sweet?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Recoils)'' NO! I mean yes. I mean I'm always happy to hang out with a friend, buddy, pal, chum, other word for friend...
|-
!McGucket
|Pal?
|-
!Mabel
|I already said pal, uh, mate?
|-
!Gideon
|How about ''soul mate?''
|-
!
|''Fireworks appear that show the name "Mabel" within a heart.''
|-
!McGucket
|Well, you can't say no to that.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Shack, where Mabel is pacing.''
|-
!Mabel
|..I mean, he's so nice, but.. I can't keep doing this. But I can't break his heart. ''(Shouts)'' I have no way out!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Enters)'' What in the heck happened on that date?
|-
!Mabel
|I don't know! I was in the friend zone, and then before I knew what was happening, he pulled me into the romance zone. It was like quick sand! Chubby quicksand!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, come on. It's not like you're gonna have to marry Gideon.
|-
!Stan
|''(Enters)'' Great news, Mabel. You have to marry Gideon!
|-
!Mabel
|WHAT?!
|-
!Stan
|It's all part of my long term deal with Buddy Gleeful. There's a lot of cash tied up in this thing. Plus I got this shirt. ''(Gestures to his "Team Gideon" shirt)'' Ugh, I am fat.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Screams and runs out of the room)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Calling after her:)'' Bodies change, honey! Bodies change...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks into the attic and seeing Mabel hiding in her sweater)'' Oh no. Mabel...
|-
!Mabel
|Mabel's not here. She's in sweater town.
|-
!Dipper
|Are you gonna come ''out'' of sweater town?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Whines and shakes head)''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, enough is enough. If you can't break up with Gideon, I'll do it for you.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Peeks out of her sweater)'' You will?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Nods)''
|-
!Mabel

|-
!Dipper
|Alright.

|''Cut to [[The Club]], where Gideon is sitting in a booth awaiting Mabel. Dipper enters, approaches Gideon and clears his throat.''
|-
!Gideon
|Oh. Dipper Pines, how are you? You look good, you look good.
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks, you uh... Look, Gideon. We've got to talk. Mabel isn't joining you tonight, she uh, she doesn't want to see you anymore. ''(Laughs nervously)'' She's uh. She's kinda weirded out by you, no offense.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Eye twitches)'' So what you're sayin' is... you've...come between us. ''(Eye twitches again)''
|-
!Dipper
|You're not gonna like, freak out or anything, are ya?
|-
!Gideon
|Of course not. These things happen. Bygones, you know.
|-
!Dipper
|So. Okay. Cool. Then again, sorry man, but uh, hey, thumbs up. Huh? ''(Backs away)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(In a whisper:)'' Thumbs up indeed, my friend.
|-
!
|''Cut to the exterior of the restaurant, where Mabel is waiting for Dipper, who then exits the restaurant.''
|-
!Mabel
|How'd it go? Was he mad? Did he try to read your mind with his psychic powers?
|-
!Dipper
|Don't worry, Mabel, he's just a kid. He doesn't have any powers.
|-
!
|''Cut to Gideon's bedroom later on.''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Breathing heavily)'' Dipper Pines, you don't know what you've done! ''(Grabs his [[Mystic Amulet|amulet]] and a candle starts to levitate and the light bulbs on his boudoir explode. Other things in the room begin to levitate)'' You've just made the biggest mistake of your life! ''(Throws the levitated objects on the ground)''
|-
!Bud
|''(Opening the door)'' Gideon Charles Gleeful, clean up your room this instant!

![[Toby Determined]]
|''(Over the phone:)'' Toby Determined, [[Gravity Falls Gossiper]].

|-
!Toby
|Water under the bridge! Say, we want to interview you about whether you've seen anything unUSUAL about this here [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|TOWN]] since you've arrived.

!Dipper
|Ughh, Gideon.
|-
!Gideon

|-
!Dipper
|What do you want from me, man?
|-
!Gideon
|Listen carefully, boy. This town has secrets you couldn't begin to comprehend!

|Is this about Mabel? I told you, she's not into you!
|-
!Gideon
|LIAR! YOU turned her against me! ''(Grabs amulet and walks toward Dipper)'' She was my peach dumplin'!

!Mabel
|Wendy, I need some advice. You've broken up with guys, right?
|-
!Wendy
|Oh yeah: [[List of unseen characters#Wendy's ex-boyfriends|Russ Durham, Eli Hall, Stoney Davidson]]...
|-
!Mabel
|I don't know what's wrong with me. I thought everything was back to normal, but I still feel all gross.
|-
!Wendy
|...Mike Worley, Nate Holt, oh, that guy with the tattoos...
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe letting Dipper do it for me was a mistake. Gideon deserves an honest break up.
|-
!Wendy
|...Danny Feldman, Mark Epston... Oh man, I'm not sure I ever actually broke up with him. No ''wonder'' he keeps calling me.
|-
!Mabel
|I know what I've gotta do. Thanks for talking to me, Wendy. ''(Runs to get a bike and rides off on it)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Takes out her ringing cell phone)'' Ignore.
|-
!
|''Dipper is running away from the merchandise being thrown at him. Gideon laughs evilly and moves a cabinet to smash Dipper. Dipper jumps out of the way and hits his head on the wall.''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan was right about you, you ARE a monster!
|-
!Gideon
|Your sister will be mine! ''(Laughs evilly and pulls the sting of one of his dolls, making it laugh evilly)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Grabs a baseball bat and gets up)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(To the doll:)'' Who's a cute little guy? You are!
|-
!Toy Gideon
|No you are!
|-
!
|''Dipper shouts and charges at Gideon with the bat. Gideon levitates Dipper and he drops the bat.''
|-
!Dipper
|She's never gonna date you, man!
|-
!Gideon
|That's a lie. ''(Looks at a box of lamb shears)'' And I'm gonna make sure you ''never'' lie to me again, friend. ''(Levitates the lamb shears)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs to the window from outside and sees Dipper and Gideon. Opens door)'' Gideon! We have to talk!
|-
!Gideon
|M-Mabel. My marshmalla. ''(Drops the shears)'' What are you doin' here?
|-
!Mabel
|I'm sorry Gideon, but I can't be your marshmallow. I needed to be honest and tell you that myself.
|-
!Gideon
|I-I don't understand. ''(Squeezes the amulet, therefore squeezing Dipper in midair)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(While choking:)'' Uh, Mabel!? This probably isn't the best time to be brutally honest with him!
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, but we can still be makeover buddies, right? Wouldn't you like that?
|-
!Gideon
|Really?
|-
!Mabel
|No, not really! ''(Pulls off Gideon's amulet and Dipper falls)'' You were like, attacking my brother, what the heck?!
|-
!Gideon
|My tie! Give it back! ''(Mabel throws the amulet to Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha! ''(Catches it)'' Not so powerful without this, are you?
|-
!Gideon
|''Screams and charges at Dipper, making him drop the amulet and breaking through the window.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Gideon scream. Gideon slaps Dipper and the two start slapping each other and then start screaming again. Mabel, who is holding the mystic amulet, levitates the two of them and then floats down.''
|-
!Mabel
|Listen Gideon, it's over. I will never, ever, date you.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Drops them and throws the amulet to the ground, breaking it)''
|-
!Gideon
|MY POWERS! Oh this isn't over. This isn't the last you'll see of wittle... ol' me! ''(Walks into the dark forest)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the Gleeful residence.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Finishes signing papers)'' Ah, this is livin', brother. ''(Knocks on the clown painting)''
|-
!Bud
|From now on it's all name brand foods and clown paintings. ''(Gideon storms in; to Gideon:)'' Well, hey, Gideon! Why, look who I—
|-
!Gideon
|''(Stands on the coffee table)'' Stanford Pines, I rebuke thee! I rebuke thee!
|-
!Stan
|Rebuke? Is that a word?
|-
!Gideon
|The entire Pines' family have invoked my fury! You will all pay recompense for your transgressions!
|-
!Stan
|What, you got like a word-a-day calendar or something?
|-
!Bud
|Apbap bap but-but sunshine? ''(Laughs nervously)'' What about our arrangement with Mabel and—
|-
!Gideon
|SILENCE!
|-
!Bud
|Well, uh, I see that he's takin' to one of his ''rages'' again. Eh, sorry Stan, I have to side with Gideon on this one. ''(Rips up the contract)''
|-
!Stan
|Okay, okay. I can see when I'm not wanted. ''(Grabs the clown painting and starts to leave)''
|-
!Bud
|Stan, I'm-I'm sorry but I'm gonna need that painting back! Stan? STAN!
|-
!Stan
|''(Running away)'' TRY AND CATCH ME, SUCKERS!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Mystery Shack, where Stan is hanging up the clown painting and the twins are a mess.''
|-
!Stan
|I coulda had it all. ''(Looks at the twins)'' What the heck happened to you two?
|-
!Mabel
|Gideon.
|-
!Dipper
|Gideon.
|-
!Stan
|Gideon. Yeah, the little mutant "swore vengeance" on the whole family. Ha, I guess he's gonna try to nibble my ankles or somethin'.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, yeah. Yeah, how's he gonna destroy us now, huh? Try to guess what number we're thinking of? ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|He'll ''never'' guess what number ''I'm'' thinking of. NEGATIVE EIGHT! No one would guess a ''negative'' number.
|-
!All
|''(Laughing)''
|-
!Stan
|Uh oh. He's plannin' on destruction right now! ''(Laughs and lays on top of the twins)''
|-
!
|''In Gideon's room. He's making dolls of the Pines family''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Playing with the Mabel doll:)'' Gideon, I still love you. If only my family weren't in the way. ''(Picks up the Stan doll and imitates Stan:)'' Look at me. I'm old, and I'm smelly. ''(Finishes the Dipper doll; mocking Dipper:)'' Hey, what are you gonna do without your precious amulet? ''(Regular voice:)'' Oh you'll see boy... ''(Closes ''[[Journal 2]]'')'' You'll see...
|-
!
|''Cut to end credits with Dipper, Mabel and Soos. Soos is facing away from the screen and Mabel is doing something to him.''
|-
!Soos
|You done?
|-
!Mabel
|Not yet.
|-
!Soos
|How about now?
|-
!Mabel
|Almost. And...there.
|-
!Soos
|''(Turns around, covered in sequins)'' Let's do this.
|-
!
|''Mabel turns the light off and Dipper shines a flashlight on Soos, causing the room to light up like a disco ball. Stan is there, having seen this all unfold.''

|You're all fired.

|What are we supposed to do!?
|-
!Lee
|I don't know man! I don't know!
|-
!Robbie
|Let's just go already!
|-
!Wendy
|Thompson!
|-
!Thompson
|''(Playing Dancy Pants Revolution)'' Wait! I've almost got the high score! (''dissolves and reappears inside the game'') Uh? What?
|-
!Dancy Pants
|It's time to shake what your mama gave you!
|-
!Thompson
|No! So many arrows!
|-
!Dancy Pants
|(''Throws arrows down on Thompson'') You're a dance machine!
|-
!Thompson
|No! ''You're'' a dance machine! (''Cries'')
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no!
|-
!Wendy
|Thompson!
|-
!Robbie
|Forget them! Let's go!
|-
!
|''The doors close''
|-
!Wendy
|What the... (''tries to open the door but can't'') Guys... It's locked!
|-
!Robbie
|OUTTA MY WAY! (''Throws the cash register at the doors, but it dissolves and green light flies at Robbie'')
|-
!Dipper
|Everybody, wait! Whatever's doing this has to have some kind of reason! (''opens 3'') Maybe if we can figure out what it is, they'll let us out of here!
|-
!Robbie
|"Uh-uh they'll let us out of here!" (''Sarcastically:'') Yeah, that makes a lot of sense!
|-
!Wendy
|I don't know guys, maybe he's got a point!
|-
!Lee
|(''Sarcastically:'') Yeah right, I'm sure the ghost just wants to talk about his feelings! (''Screams as he dissolves and reappears on a cereal box'') W-what?
|-
!Cereal box Toucan
|I'm bonkers for eating you alive! (''Holds up a spoon'')

!Lee
|No! (''Screams as a stabbing sound is heard'')
|-
!Nate
|Lee! Okay, okay.. I'm with you kid! 100%, man!
|-
!Pa
|(''Possessing Mabel, flies up behind counter; through Mabel, deep voice:'') Welcome.
|-
!Dipper, Nate, Robbie, and Wendy
|(''Scream'')
|-
!Dipper
|They got Mabel!
|-
!Pa
| Welcome to your graves, young trespassers. (''Kicks legs and laughs'')
|-
!Wendy
|We're super sorry for hanging out in your store!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah! Can we just go now and leave forever?
|-
!Pa
|Well... okay. You're free to go. (''Opens doors'') But before you leave, hot dogs are now half off. I know it might be crazy, but you gotta try these dogs!
|-
!Nate and Robbie
|(''Scream and run for the door'')
|-
!Pa

|-
!Nate
|Just let us out of here already!

|-
!Dipper
|DUCK!
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|(''Duck to avoid a flying shelf'')
|-
!Wendy

|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|(''Run to a tipped over ice machine and hide inside and pant'')
|-
!Wendy
|What do they want from us?!
|-
!Dipper
|Revenge, I guess?
|-
!Wendy
|What did we do wrong?
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Why was each person taken? Tambry was texting, Thompson was playing a video game, Lee was being sarcastic; it doesn't make any sense!
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah! I mean, those are all just normal teenage things.
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy, say that last part again.
|-
!Wendy
|Normal teenage things?
|-
!Dipper
|Of course! Stay here until I get back! (''crawls out of the freezer'')
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, what are you doing?!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey ghost!
|-
!Pa
|(''twists Mabel's head around to face Dipper, then turns the rest of her body towards him'')
|-
!Dipper
|I've got something to tell you! I'm not a teenager!

!Pa
|(''drops everything that's floating and appears holding Mabel by her hair with Ma'') Hohoho! Well why didn't you say so? (''drops Mabel into a pile of candy'')
|-
!Mabel
|(''Falling:'') WAAH! (''Lands in the candy and rubs her head'') Ohhh...
|-
!Pa
|How old did you say you were?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm... (''Reluctantly:'') I'm twelve, technically not a teen.
|-
!Ma
|When we were alive, teenagers were a scourge on our store!
|-
!Pa
|Always sassafrassin' costumers with their boomy boxes and disrespectful short pants! (''Flashbacks to the day he and Ma died'') So we decided to up and ban them! (''Pa in the flashback places a sign labeled "NO TEENS" on the store window'') But they retaliated with this new fangled rap music.
|-
!Ma
|(''In the flashback, hugs Pa'') The lyrics, they were so, hateful!
|-
!90's Teens
|(''In the flashback, dancing to the rap:'') Homework's whack, and so are rules! Tuckin' in you're shirt's for fools!
|-
!Pa
|(''In the flashback:'') NO!
|-
!Ma
|It was so shocking, we were stricken down with double heart attacks!
|-
!Ma and Pa
|(''In the flashback, clutch their chests and collapse, dead'')
|-
!
|''The flashback ends''
|-
!Ma
|(''Brightly:'') That's why we hate teenagers so much! Don't we, honey?
|-
!Ma and Pa
|(''Nuzzle'')
|-
!Dipper
|But they're my friends, isn't there anything I can do to, help them?
|-
!Pa
|There is one thing. Do you know any funny little dances?
|-
!Dipper
|Uh... is there anything ''else'' I can do?
|-
!Pa
|(''Lights himself on fire'') NOOOO!
|-
!Dipper
|OKAY OKAY OKAY! Um... Well, I do know... (''Reluctantly:'') the Lamby Lamby Dance. Bu-but I can't really do it, without a lamb costume! (''Folds his arms, happy to be out of it'')
|-
!Pa
|(''Snaps his fingers and Dipper is in a lamb costume'')
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, well... there it is. (''Takes a deep breath, sings the [[Lamby Lamby Dance]]'') Wellll...
Who wants a Lamby lamby lamby?
I do! I do!
So go up and greet your Mammy mammy mammy!
Hi there! Hi there!
So march march march around the daisies... (''Wendy smiles; this is the cutest thing she had ever seen'')
|-
!Pa
|Yes, Yes! More! MORE!
|-
!Dipper
|(''Marching and singing:'') Don't don't don't you forget about the babies! (''Sweats, winks'')
|-
!Pa
|That was so fine, girly dancin' boy! Your friends are free.
|-
!Dipper
|(''In normal clothes'') Well I don't think you have to worry about us coming back, so...
|-
!Ma and Pa
|(''Disappear and allow everything to fall back to the floor and freeing the teens'')
|-
!Mabel
|Ugghh... I'm never gonna eat or do anything ever again.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! (''Picks up a package of Smile Dip'') There's still some left!
|-
!Mabel
|(''Slaps it out of his hand'') EVIL!
|-
!Lee
|(''To Wendy:'') What-what happened after everything went crazy?
|-
!Wendy
|You are not going to believe it! The ghosts appeared, (''laughing:'') and Dipper had to... (''sees Dipper looking at her, silently pleading with her not to tell anyone'') Uh, and uh, Dipper just grabbed a bat, and just started beating ghosts down, left and right, and the ghost got all scared, and ran away like a couple of little girls, it was insane!
|-
!Nate
|Alright! Dr. Funtimes!
|-
!Wendy
|(''Turns to Dipper and zips lips'')
|-
!Dipper
|(''Zips lips'')

|''Cut to everyone except Dipper and Wendy sleeping in the van.''
|-
!Wendy
|Well, I'm probably scarred for life.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, that was pretty crazy.
|-
!Wendy
|I think I'll go stare at a wall for a while and RETHINK EVERYTHING. Hey, next time we hang out, let's stay at the Mystery Shack. Okay?
|-
!Dipper
|Next time? Yah! Let's, let's hang out at the Shack! Yeah... (''gets in the car, to himself:'') Next time... (''gets in the car and sits next to Mabel'')
|-
!Mabel
|OHHHHH... (''sees the thing she wrote earlier'') What kind of sick joke is this?
|-
!
|''The car drives away from the store, and the lights go out in the store. Cut to credits.''
|-
!Stan
|(''In front of the TV'') Ah, the wedding. I've waited so long for this. Oh, look at her in that dress! (''angrily as people on the TV gasp:'') Count Lionel? What's he doin' here?!
|-
!Count Lionel
|(''From TV:'') I've come to reclaim my bride!
|-
!Stan
|You had your chance at the cotillion, you!
|-
!Man
|(''From TV:'') You had your chance at the cotillion, you!
|-
!Stan
|That's what I'm SAYING! UuuaaaAAAAGGGHHH!

|Uh, couldn't find the remote.

|''Dipper and Mabel hit their stomachs against each other three times.''
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, sure. Soon as this yahoo makes up his mind.
|-
!Tyler
|''(Pointing at a fur trout)'' Do you have this in another animal?
|-
!Stan
|I'm fine locking him inside if you are.

!Lazy Susan
|I got hit by a bus!
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha ha ha! Hilarious!
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Thank you. Ha ha ha ha hee hee ho ho ho.

!Stan
|You do split plates, right?
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Maybe... (''Makes her lazy eye wink'') Wink!
|-
!Stan
|Great! We'll all split a one-fourth of the number seven, plus a free salad dressing for the lady, and a small plate of ketchup for the boy.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|(''Writes it down and walks off'')
|-
!Mabel
|But Grunkle Stan, I want pancakes!
|-
!Stan
|With the fancy flour they use these days? What am I, made of money? (''A piece of money shows out of Stan's sleeve'') Tap tap. (''Taps it back in the sleeve'')
|-
!Mabel
|Awww...
|-
!Dipper
|(''Looks over and sees the Manliness Tester'') Don't worry guys, pancakes are on me. I'm gonna win some by beating that manliness tester.
|-
!Stan
|Manliness Tester?
|-
!Mabel
|Beating?
|-
!Stan and Mabel
|''(Burst out laughing)''
|-
!Stan
|He says he's... he says he... HA HA HA HA HA HA!
|-
!Dipper
|What? What's so funny?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, no offense Dipper, but you're not exactly "Manly Mannington." Ha ha ha!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, I am too "Manly... Manny" or whatever it is you said.
|-
!Stan
|Look, face the music, kid. You got no muscles, you smell like baby wipes, and let's not forget last Tuesday's... "incident."

|DON'T COME IN! ''DON'T COME IN!''
|-
!
|''Cuts back to the present.''
|-
!Mabel
|You were listening to girly Icelandic pop sensation "[[BABBA]]"?
|-
!Dipper
|No. Heh heh, I wasn't. It's not important. Look, come on guys, I'm plenty masculine. You see this chest hair? (''Brings down shirt, to show his chest and it shines very brightly'')
|-
!Mabel
|Put it away, put it away!
|-
!Stan
|So smooth! My eyes!
|-
!Dipper
|Aw man...
|-
!Stan and Mabel
|(''Burst out laughing again'')
|-
!Dipper
|Fine, "family of little faith." Get ready to eat your words. (''Gets up'') And a plate a delicious pancakes. (''Walks toward the manliness tester as other people eating watch)'' Alright, Dipper. Time to manhandle this...man handle...
|-
!
|''Dipper stares up at the machine and starts sweating.''
|-
!Dipper
|And a one and a two...
|-
!Stan
|Quit stallin'!
|-
!
|''Dipper starts tugging on the handle and the light starts moving toward the category he belongs in. The categories are "wimp," "middle-aged woman," "barely possible," "man," and "manly man." Dipper keeps on pulling the handle until the light goes down to "wimp." A card comes out of the machine that says "You are a cutie patootie!"''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, what? This thing must be broken. It's totally broken, guys. It's like a million years old, probably ran out of steam power or-
|-
!
|''Dipper gets pushed out of the way by [[Manly Dan]]. Manly Dan cracks his knuckles.''
|-
!Dipper
|It's rickety man, you shouldn't even-
|-
!
|''Manly Dan pushes on the handle with his pinky and the machine automatically goes to "Manly Man" before exploding and giving everyone free pancakes.''
|-
!Manly Dan
|Yes! Pancakes for everyone!
|-
!
|''Everyone at the restaurent'' cheers. A pancake falls on Dipper's head. Mabel and Stan laugh at Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|I need to get some chest hair and fast. (''Starts running out but is tripped by a beaver'') I'm fine! Heh heh! Everything's fine! (''Runs out'')
|-
!Stan
|Yeesh! How am I related to that?
|-
!Mabel
|Come on, Grunkle Stan. I'm sure deep down you have a soft side too.
|-
!Stan
|Ha! Nothing in here but a cold, dark, empty soul.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|(''Puts the food on the table'') Food!
|-
!Stan
|Thanks there, sugar pot. I-I mean, I mean uh honey wasp, kitten baby, b-baby cow.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Ha ha! Silly! (''Starts walking away'') Silly man...
|-
!Mabel
|What was that about?
|-
!Stan
|Nothing. I don't wanna talk about it. Talk about what? Why is this table wet?
|-
!Mabel
|Wait just a second. I think I have an idea happening here. You...
|-
!Stan
|No!
|-
!Mabel
|And her...
|-
!Stan
|Stop it!
|-
!Mabel
|AAAHH!
|-
!Stan
|Oh boy.
|-
!Mabel
|You have a thing for Lazy Susan! You do have a soft side!
|-
!Stan
|''(Puts his finger over her mouth)'' Keep it down, will ya?! Alright. I admit it, okay? It would be nice if she liked me. But I've been out of the game for so long I wouldn't know where to start. I mean, look at her. She's so classy.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|(''Hits the spinning pie trolley'') Spin, ya dumb pies, spin!
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, you are a cranky, gross, weird old man. But we will get Lazy Susan to like you because nothing is stronger than the power of-
|-
!Stan
|Love?
|-
!Mabel
|Mabel. To victory! (''Drinks salad dressing'')

!
|''Cuts to Dipper walking down the street.''
|-
!Dipper
|Not manly enough, stupid diner, stupid lumberjack... (''Gets sprayed by water'')
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Another hydrant destroyed. It's a gosh dang mystery.
|-
!Deputy Durland
|Wanna take off our uniforms and run around in circles?
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|(''With his shirt off'') Quit readin' my mind.
|-
!
|''They both start running around with their shirts off and screaming in delight. Dipper backs up and bumps into a woman.'''
|-
![[Unnamed scout lady]]
|Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for the mailman.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh what? Are you saying I'm not a "male man?" Is that what you're trying to say? I'm not male? I'm not a man? Is that-is that what you're getting at?
|-
!Unnamed scout lady
|Are you crying?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Tries not to cry and runs off. Cut to him in the woods)'' 2...3...4... (''bench pressing a small branch. He tosses the branch aside and looks in his shirt'') No chest hair yet. (''Lays on the ground'') Is it physical, is it mental, what's the secret? (''Holds up a [[Real Man Jerky|bag of jerky]] that says "You're inadequate!"'') You said it brother. I need help.
|-
!
|''The ground begins to shake very hard and a large roar is heard. Various animals begin flying or running in the opposite direction of the noise''
|-
!Manly Dan
|For the love of all that's holy, run! (''Runs off'')
|-
!
|''A tree begins to fall on the stump that has Dipper's hat, and Dipper runs and grabs it before the tree squashes it. Another roar is heard and the shadow of a creature is seen getting closer to Dipper''
|-
!Dipper
|(''Screams high pitched'') Wait...sorry. (''Screams on a lower octave and coughs'')
|-
!
|''[[Chutzpar]] comes out of the forest and lets out another loud roar, however it is just a yawn. It takes a deer and scratches itself, and throws it away afterward. The deer soon runs off. Chutzpar looks over in Dipper's direction and knocks away the log he is hiding behind''
|-
!Dipper
|Please don't eat me! I haven't showered! In like a week! And, I'm all elbows! Elbows, and gristle!
|-
!Chutzpar
|YOU...!
|-
!Dipper
|Ah!
|-
!Chutzpar
|Gonna finish that?
|-
!Dipper
|(''Looks at the jerky'') No. (''Tosses it to him and the Minotaur begins eating'') I can't believe it, part animal, part human. Are you some kind of Minotaur?
|-
!Chutzpar
|I'm a [[Manotaurs|manotaur]]! Half man! Half...uh...half taur!
|-
!Dipper
|So did I, like, summon you or-?
|-
!Chutzpar
|The smell of jerky summoned me! JERKY! (''Punches a tree down and smashes a rock against his head'') YEAH!! Ha ha! Heh. (''Starts sniffing the air and then smells Dipper'') I smell... emotional issues!
|-
!Dipper
|I have problems, Manotaur. Man-related problems.
|-
!Chutzpar
|''(Sits down and pats his leg)''
|-
!Dipper
|(''Rests head on the Chutzpar's leg'') Well, my own uncle called me a wimp...
|-
!Chutzpar
|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
|-
!Dipper
|And I kind of flunked this manliness video game thing...
|-
!Chutzpar
|Mm.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, you know, you seem pretty manly. Maybe you could give me some pointers?
|-
!Chutzpar
|Very well. Climb atop my back hair, child!
|-
!Dipper
|Uh... okay.
|-
!Chutzpar
|''(Running through the woods with Dipper on his back)'' Ha ha ha ha ha ha! (''Crashes through a tree and keeps running'')

|''Inside the mountain is a [[Man Cave|cave]] full of Manotaurs''
|-
!Dipper
|This place is amazing!
|-
!Chutzpar
|The [[gnomes]] live in the trees, the [[merpeople]] live in the water, 'Cause they're losers! But we Manotaurs, crash in the MAN CAVE! (''Rings a gong'') BEASTS! I have brought you, a hairless child! (''pushes Dipper forward'')
|-
!Dipper
|....S'up.
|-
!Chutzpar

|My name's Dipper...''(Manotaurs boo)'' The...uh, Destructor?
|-
!Manotaurs
|Yeah. Yeah that's better. ''(they nod)''

!Mabel
|Okay, Grunkle Stan. Welcome to the first day of whatever is left of your life! First, a before picture. ''(Takes a picture of Stan and startles him with the flash)''
|-
!Stan
|Ahh!
|-
!Mabel
|I never miss a scrapbookertunity!'' (opens scrapbook) ''Deedly dum, memories. ''(slaps the picture on an empty page)'' Bleep. Let's start out with some roleplaying. Soos will play Lazy Susan.
|-
![[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]
|I'm soft, like a woman.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, show me how you approach a woman. Remember this is a safe, non-judgemental environment. I'll just be right off the side judging you on a scale from one to ten.
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks up to Soos and spits to the side)'' Can I borrow some money?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Blows whistle) ''This is gonna be harder than I thought.

!Manotaur
|After a lot of punching, we have decided to deny your request to learn our manly secrets.
|-
!Manotaur #2
|Denied! ''(punches himself in the face)''
|-
!Dipper
|Denied? Ok, fine. That's ok with me. Obviously you guys think it would be too hard to train me. Maybe, you're not ''man'' enough to try.
|-
!Manotaur #3
|Not MAN enough!? ''(Stomps forward)''
|-
!Chutzpar
|Destructor...
|-
!Manotaur #3
|Not MAN enough!? 
|-
!Chutzpar
|He didn't mean it.
|-
!Manotaur #3
|I have three Y chromosomes, six adam's apples, pecs on my abs and FISTS FOR NIPPLES!
|-
!Dipper
|Seems to me you're too ''scared'' to teach me how to be a man. Hey, do you guys hear that? It sounds like.. Bock-bock. Bock. Oh, that's weird-Bocock, bocAW! Is that?-BACAWK! That sounds like-BACAW! Yeah, a bunch of chickens!
|-
!
|''Manotaurs gasp, and huddle again''
|-
!Manotaur
|I feel all weird.

!Manotaur #2
|He's using some sort of ''brain'' magic!
|-

|Great! Thanks guys, whatever it is, I will ''not'' let you down.

|''(Puts his hand in the hole)'' AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
|-
!
|''His screams cause birds to fly away. Cuts to Mabel and Grunkle Stan inside of the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Mabel
|(Sitting in chair) Alright! Let's try to get that inner beauty on the outside. Smile harder.
|-
!Stan
|''(Struggling to make an unconvincing smile)'' EHHH...AGGHHH...
|-
!Mabel
|(''Stands up in her chair'') Harder!
|-
!Stan
|(Still struggling to smile) AGGGHHH...WEEAAGGHH...
|-
!Mabel
|Perfect. (Yelling) Soos!
|-
!Soos
|(''Appears beside Mabel, holding sandwich'') Sup, hambone. (''Chews sandwich'')
|-
!Mabel
|(''To Soos'') Wha'd'you think?
|-
!Soos
|AAAAAAHHHH!!! (''Throws his sandwich in the air, and runs out of the shack, leaving the door swinging on its hinges''.)
|-
!Mabel
|(Sighs) This is going to take some really great training music. (Holds up a CD labeled "Training Mix", puts it in a CD player and presses play)
|-
!
|''Camera zooms out, [[Training Montage|music]] starts, Mabel dances, Stan scratches his back. Cuts to Manotaurs and Dipper in a hot spring''
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, I just wanna say that these last few hours have been...I-I feel like there's really been some growth.
|-
!Glurk
|I have a growth!
|-
!Dipper
|Glurk, you are hilarious today!
|-
!Glurk
|(''clicks tongue'')
|-
!Dipper
|It's just you guys took me under your wing, and have just been so supportive.
|-
!Chutzpar
|(''Makes hand gesture'') Oh, stop.
|-
!Dipper
|No, you know what? You really have been. I think I feel like I'm finally becoming a man here.
|-
!Chutzpar
|(''Waves hand'') Not yet, Destructor. One final task remains. The deadliest trial of all.
|-
!Dipper
|(''Clenches fist'') I've survived forty-nine other trials. Whatever it is, bring it on!
|-
!Manotaurs
|(''Together'') Yeah!
|-
!
|''Cut to a Manotaur lighting a torch. Camera pans around to where Chutzpar and Dipper are standing. Chutzpar licks a tattoo and applies it to Dipper's arm. It reads "Rad Dude". The other says "Too Cool". Dipper stands up tall, and the first row of Manotaurs kneel before him. The row behind takes out bones and plays the others' heads like drums.''
|-
!Chutzpar
|Behold our leader, Leaderaur!
|-
!
|''Cut to a view of a cave with two Manotaurs standing in front. They part, and an old, hunched Manotaur walks out.''
|-
!Old Manotaur
|(''Humming'') Rum te tum tum...
|-
!Dipper
|Is he like the oldest, or wisest, or...?
|-
!Old Manotaur
|(''Raises hand slowly'') Greetings, young-(''A mouth comes down into the frame and eats the old manotaur'') - AAAGHHHHHH!
|-
!Chutzpar
|Naw, he's just the offering. That (''points upward'') is Leaderaur.
|-
!
|''Camera pans up Leaderaur's body, up to his head. He sucks in the old manotaur and swallows.''
|-
![[Leaderaur]]
|You - You wish to be a man?
|-
!Dipper
|(''Banging on chest'') HUUUAAARRRRGGHHH!
|-
!Manotaurs
|(''Together'') Yeah!
|-
!Leaderaur
|Then you must heroic act, go to highest mountain (''reaches into his chest and pulls out a spear'') and bring back head of...the [[Multi-Bear]]! (''tosses spear at Dipper's feet.'')
|-
!Manotaurs
|(''Gasp'')
|-
!Dipper
|The Multi-Bear? Is that some sort of bear..?
|-
!Leaderaur
|He's our sworn enemy! Conquer him and your mansformation will be complete.
|-
!Dipper
|Conquer? I don't know, man.
|-
!Chutzpar
|(''Looks through Dipper's backpack and pulls out the BABBA case'') Destructor, is this yours?
|-
!Dipper
|(''snatches it'') Oh no! Ha ha, I don't know whose that is, just borrowing it, friend's, not mine.
|-
!Manotaur
|Mmm, I don't know about this...
|-
!Dipper
|Uh...(''walks back to the spear'') Hmph. (''picks it up over his head'') I SHALL CONQUER THE MULTI-BEAR!
|-
!
|''The manotaurs cheer. Leaderaur spouts fire from his nose. A fire spark falls on Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Puts out the fire)'' I'm okay!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to a montage of Dipper climbing up the mountain. Dipper arrives to Multi-bear's cave.''
|-
!Dipper
|I'm comin' for you, multi-bear.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, Grunkle Stan. You started like this.. ''(Puts up Stan's before picture)'' But you became.. ''(Lowers picture to see Stan with messy clothes and sweat)''
|-
!Stan
|Can I scratch myself now?
|-
!Mabel
|No! No, no, no! Is that throw up on your shirt?
|-
!Stan
|I don't know how to answer that.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Rips the before picture.)''
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]]
|Face it, Mabel. Your uncle's unfixable. Like that spitting pie thing in the diner.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, come with me! ''(Runs to the door)'' And leave your pants at home! 
|-
!Stan
|With pleasure! ''(Walks to Mabel)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper entering the cave.''
|-
!Dipper
|What ''is'' a Multi-bear?
|-
!
|''Behind Dipper, the multi-bear wakes up. Dipper then notices the muti-bear behind him. Multi-bear roars.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, that's a multi-bear.
|-
!Multi-bear
|''(Many bear heads roaring; main head:)'' Bear heads, silence! ''(Hits the head still roaring. It gets silent after a bit) ''Child, why have you come here?
|-
!Dipper
|Multi-bear! I seek your head! Or, one of them, anyway? There's like-what? Six heads?
|-
!Multi-bear
|This is foolish! Leave now! Or die!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Points his spear at multi-bear.)''
|-
!Multi-bear
|So be it! ''(Heads roar; he charges at Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs up the wall)''
|-
!Multi-bear
|''(Smacks a pile of bones towards Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Hides behind a rock, avoiding the bones. Jumps on one of multi-bear's head and runs to the top, choking the main head with the spear and making the Multi-bear fall down)'' A real man shows no mercy!
|-
!Multi-bear
|''(Sighs) ''Very well, warrior. But will you grant a magical beast one last request? 
|-
!Dipper
|Uh.. Okay.
|-
!Multi-bear
|I wish to die listening to my favorite song. 
|-
!
|''Zoom out to a tape player.''
|-
!Multi-bear
|The tape is already in there. You can just hit any- ''(Dipper presses a button)'' Yeah, yeah, that's it. 
|-
!
|''The song "Disco Girl" plays.''
|-
!Dipper
|You listen to Icelandic pop group BABBA? I-I love BABBA.
|-
!Multi-bear
|I thought I was the the only one. All the manotaurs made fun of me because I know all the words to the song "Disco Girl."
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, you mean'' (singing:) ''Disco girl...
|-
!Multi-bear
|''(Singing:)'' Coming through...
|-
!Multi-bear and Dipper
|''(Singing:)'' That girl is you! Oo-oo o-oo!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Laughs)'' This is crazy! Finally someone who-who understands- uh.. Oh yeah. I guess I'm suppose to kill you? Or I'll never be a man? 
|-
!Multi-bear
|I accept my fate.
|-
!Dipper
|No! ''(Pause) ''Really?
|-
!Multi-bear
|It's for the best.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Raises his spear but it hits the floor of the mancave.)'' I'm not gonna do it.
|-
!Leaderaur
|You were told! The price of man is the multi-bear's head!
|-
!Dipper
|Listen, Leaderaur, alright? You too, Tesosteraur, Pubertaur, and.. I don't know, whatever you're name is. B-Beardy.
|-
!Beardy
|It's Beardy.
|-
!Dipper
|You keep telling me that being a man means doing all these tasks, and being aggro all the time, but I'm starting to think that stuff's malarkey.
|-
!
|''The manotaurs gasp.''
|-
!Dipper
|You heard me, malarkey. So maybe I don't have muscles, or hair in certain places, and.. sure, when a girly pop song comes on the radio, sometimes, I leave it on! 'Cause dang it, top 40 hits are in the top 40 for a reason! They're catchy!
|-
!Chutzpar
|Destructor.. What are you saying? 
|-
!Dipper
|I'm saying the Multi-bear is a really nice guy. And you're bunch of jerks if you want me to cut off his head! 
|-
!Leaderaur
|''(Stands up and destroys the spear)'' Kill the multi-bear or never be a man!
|-
!Dipper
|Then I guess I'll never be a man.
|-
!Chutzpar
|Boooo! Weak!
|-
!Manotaurs
|Boooooo! Lame! Boooo!
|-
!Chutzpar
|Hey guys! Who wants to go build something and knock it down!
|-
!
|''The manotaurs cheer and leave, chanting "Man!" several times. Dipper kicks a rock away and walks away. Cut to Greasy' Diner.''
|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(Hitting pie trolley)'' SPIN! SPIN!
|-
!Mabel
|(Enters with Stan) Lazy Susan. Listen: I know he's not much to look at, but you're always fixing stuff in the diner, and if you like fixing stuff, nothing can use more fixing than my Grunkle Stan! Also women live longer than men so your dating pool is smaller and you should really lower your standards.
|-
!Stan
|So, Lazy Susan, what do you say?
|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(Leaves)''
|-
!Stan
|Uhhhh... ''(Walks away)''
|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(Comes back with a piece of paper and a piece of pie) ''Heeeeyyyy! Here's my number. Why don't you give me a call some time?
|-
!Stan
|Really?!
|-
!Lazy Susan
|REALLY!! HAHA. Also: here's some pie. On the house. For YOU! ''(leaves)''
|-
!Mabel
|EEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! We did it! When are you gonna call? You wanna call now? I don't have a phone. Let's buy a phone! We can put it on a credit card. Let's get a credit card.
|-
!Stan
|Mabel! Let a man enjoy his pie, huh?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Comes up to the restaurant)''
|-
!Mabel
|DIPPER!! It's me, Mabel! I'm looking at you through this glass! Right here! This is my voice! I'm talking to you from inside!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Nods and gives Mabel a "Calm down" sign. Comes inside)''
|-
!Mabel
|Did you see me through the-?
|-
!Dipper
|Yes.
|-
!Mabel
|What's wrong?
|-
!Dipper
|I don't want to talk about it.
|-
!Stan
|Good.
|-
!Dipper
|It's just these half man half bull humanoids were hanging out with me...
|-
!Stan
|Here we go.
|-
!Dipper
|But then they wanted me to do this really tough, horrible thing but it just wasn't right. So I said no.
|-
!Stan
|You were your own man and you stood up for yourself.
|-
!Dipper
|Huh?
|-
!Stan
|
Well, you did what was right even when no one agreed with ya. Sounds pretty manly to me but, what do I know?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Smiles)''
|-
!Mabel
|Wait a minute, do my eyes deceive me? You have a chest hair!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Checks his chest and gasp)'' You're right! I do! Ha ha, this is amazing! I really do! Take that, man tester! Take that, Pituitor!
|-
!Stan
|Pituitor?
|-
!Dipper
|This guy has chest hair!
|-
!Mabel
|''(pulls it out and puts it in a journal)'' Scrap-book ortunity!
|-
!Stan
|Don't worry, kid, if you're anything like me, there's more where that came from. ''(rips open his shirt)''
|-
!Dipper
|OH, GROSS!!!
|-
!Everyone
|HAHAHAHAHA!
|-
!Dipper
|Seriously, that's disgusting.

|-
!Stan Pines
|''(Takes Silly String cans and confetti)'' Alright, alright! Party supplies are now off-limits.
|-
!Soos Ramirez
|Mr. Pines, whose birthday is it again?
|-
!Stan
|Nobody's. Thought this party might be a good way to get kids to spend money at the Shack. (''Unrolls a "Pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey" game)''
|-
!Soos
|Nice!
|-
!Stan
|The young people of this town want fun; I'll smother 'em with fun!
|-
!Dipper
|(''Pouring Mabel some Diet Pitt Peach Soda) ''Maybe comments like that are why kids ''don't ''go to the Mystery Shack.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, hey! Hows about you make yourself useful and copy these flyers? ''(Shows Dipper and Mabel a flyer)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh boy, a trip to the copier store!
|-
!Soos
|Calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more! They got it all at the copier store! That's not their slogan, I just really feel that way about the copier store.
|-
!Stan
|Save the trouble. You know the old [[Cloning copy machine|copier]] in my office? I finally fixed the old girl up! Good as new!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel are in Stan's office. They pull the sheet off the old, busted up copier machine. Several moths fly around it.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Butterflies!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Lifts the lid up)'' Does it even work? ''(Presses a button, then rests his arm on the machine. It turns on, and creates a copy of his arm)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Picks up the paper)'' Success! ''(Notices the paper shaking and drops it) ''Whoa!
|-
!
|''The picture of Dipper's arm comes to life and begins to crawl near them.''
|-
!Mabel and Dipper
|AH!
|-
!Dipper
|Stay back! ''(Throws Mabel's soda at the arm, disintegrating it)'' Oh my gosh! Mabel, I think this copier can copy human beings!
|-
!Mabel
|Do you realize what this means? (''Pauses'') BBBBLLLAAAA!! ''(Sprays Silly String at Dipper)''

|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!
|''Stan addresses Soos, Wendy, Mabel, and Dipper, who are all standing side-by-side.''
|-
!Stan
|Alright party people... and Dipper. Let's talk business. Soos, because you'll work for free, and you begged, I'm lettin' you be DJ.
|-
!Soos
|You won't regret it, Mr. Pines. I got this book to teach me how to DJ R-R-Right! ''(Holds up [[How To DJ R-R-R-R-ight|book]])''
|-
!Stan
|Not encouraging. Wendy, you and Mabel will work at the ticket stand.
|-
!Mabel
|What? But Grunkle Stan, this party is my chance to make new friends!
|-
!Dipper
|I... I could work with Wendy.
|-
!Stan
|''(Rolls eyes) ''You realize that if you do, you gotta commit to stay in at the ticket stand with Wendy. No getting out of it, just the two of you, ''alone'', all night.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Watches Wendy spray Soos' belly with Silly String, smiles) ''I promise. ''(Cut to Dipper standing in front of a mirror in his room putting on a bow tie; he turns to get the spray and sees Mabel there)'' AH! ''(Turns)'' What?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pretending to be Dipper:) ''Uh, uh, I could work the counter with you, Wendy! Let's kiss! ''(Pretends to kiss someone)''
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, yeah. Laugh all you want, but I devised a plan to make sure my night with Wendy goes perfect. ''(Makes clicking noise)''
|-
!Mabel
|Plan? Oh, you're not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you?
|-
!Dipper
|Psh. Over complicated? Let me just... (''unfolds a huge list) ''alright, fold that there, kay. Step 1: Getting to know each with playful banter. Banter is like talking but smarter.
|-
!Mabel
|That sounds like a dumb idea for poopheads.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, see? This isn't banter. This is what I want to avoid with Wendy. The final step is to ask her to dance. ''(Imagines a taller version of himself and Wendy dancing)''
|-
!Wendy
|Oh Dipper! I'm so happy you decided to work the ticket stand with me; you're so organized. Show me that checklist again.
|-
!Dipper
|(''Pulls out checklist from pocket)''
|-
!Wendy
|Oh!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Real life:)'' If I follow steps 1 through 11, nothing can get in my way!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, you're the one getting in your way. Why can't you just walk up and talk to her like a normal person?
|-
!Dipper
|Step 9, sister! ''(Points to Step 9, which is "talk to her like a normal person.")''

!Mabel
|(''Sighs and rolls her eyes)''

!
|''The party begins. Stan walks over to Mabel.''
|-
!Stan

!Grenda
|Hi, I'm Grenda. (''Gestures to Candy, in the chair next to her)'' This is [[Candy Chiu|Candy]].

!Candy Chiu
|''(Waves to Mabel; there are forks taped on her fingers)''
|-
!Mabel
|Why do have forks taped to your fingers?

!Candy

!Mabel
|Who's that?
|-
!Candy
|The most popular girl in town, Pacifica Northwest.
|-
!Grenda
|I always feel bad about myself around her.
|-
!Soos
|I can't just give you the crown. It's sort of a competition thing.
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Laughs and picks up microphone)'' Honestly, who's gonna compete against me? Fork girl? Lizard lady? (''Laughs)''
|-
!Grenda
|Hold me, Candy! (''Hugs Candy)''

|''(To Pacifica:)'' I'm Mabel.

!Pacifica
|That sounds like a fat old lady's name.

!Mabel
|I'll take that as a compliment!
|-
!Pacifica
|May the better partier win. ''(Menacingly walks away with her friends)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Pacifica:)'' Nice meeting you! ''(To Grenda and Candy:)'' She's going down.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Looks at party through window)'' Whoa! Sounds like the party's getting nuts.
|-
!Soos
|Let the battle for the party crown begin! Mabel comes out strong! Watch out, Pacifica!
|-
!Wendy
|I gotta get in there! ''(To Dipper:)'' Cover for me?

!Dipper
|Umm... well I, um–
|-
!Wendy
|Thanks, man! ''(Goes inside and dances)''
|-
!Dipper

!Stan
|''(Grabs Dipper by the back of his shirt) ''Hey! What are you doing, kid? These suckers aren't gonna rip themselves off!

|I did?

!Stan

|-
!Dipper's voice
|I promise.
|-
!Stan

|-
!Wendy
|Woo-hoo-hoo!
|-
!Dipper
|If only I could be two places at once. ''(Goes into Stan's office, lies down on the copy machine and presses the copy button)'' I wonder if this is a good idea.
|-
!
|''Dipper is copied. The paper with the copy of him falls to the ground. It ripples, and the Dipper clone comes to life.''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! ...I have a really big head.
|-
!Dipper and Clone
|So, uh... ''(Chuckles)'' sorry, you first. Stop copying me! ''(Laugh)''
|-
!Clone
|''(Tries to slap his leg but hits his elbow on the copy machine)'' Ow, ow! Funny bone!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Writes the number 2 on the clone's head)'' I will call you: Number 2.
|-
!Number 2
|Definitely not. You know a name I've always wanted?
|-
!Dipper and Number 2
|[[Tyrone]]?
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, Tyrone. Let's get down to business. I'm thinking you cover me at the ticket stand, while I ask Wendy to dance.
|-
!Tyrone
|I know the plan, buddy.
|-
!Dipper and Tyrone
|''(Pull out Dipper's plan)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Backs away from Tyrone)'' Hey, we're not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we?
|-
!Tyrone
|Dipper, please. This is you you're talking about. Plus, hey! ''(Snaps his fingers) ''You can always just disintegrate with me with water.

!Dipper and Tyrone
|''(Tap their heads) ''Yeeah... ''(Tap each other's heads)'' Yeeeeah!

!
|''Tyrone mans the ticket station while Dipper is inside. They give each other the thumbs up. Dipper then walks over to Wendy.''
|-
!Dipper
|Great news, Wendy! I got someone to cover the concessions for me!

|Robbie, you're a stupid, arrogant fraud; but kiss me anyway because you can play guitar. Oh wait, I forgot something. ''(Walks over and punches Dipper; to Robbie:) LET'S GET MARRIED TONIGHT!''
|-
!Tyrone
|''(Calls Dipper)'' Hey buddy it's me, you. I just had the same jealousy fantasy.
|-
!Dipper
|We got to get rid of Robbie if I ever want to dance with Wendy!
|-
!Wendy
|Hey, Dipper! We're gonna go sit on the couch! Meet us when you're done.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no! They're sitting on the couch! We gotta think of something quick! ''(sees Robbie's bike)'' I got an idea!
|-
!Tyrone
|I got the same one. But we're gonna need some help.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Cut to Stan's office, where he is writing the number 3 on a third clone's hat)'' And that's where you come in number three!
|-
!Number 3
|But what if Robbie catches me? I'll be all alone!
|-
!Tyrone
|Yeah, makes a good point.
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, one more. Good point. Four Dippers. This is a four Dipper plan. ''(Makes another copy of himself)''
|-
!
|''The machine jams.''
|-
!Tyrone
|Uh-oh, paper jam. (''Pulls the paper out of the machine and screams as it comes to life)''
|-
![[Paper Jam Dipper]]
|''(Rising out of the paper and attacking Tyrone)'' NYANYANYANYANYA-NAAAAA-NAAAAA. AAXUXAASSUAA-AAAA.
|-
!Number 3
|C'mon, you're not gonna make me partner up with ''him'', are you?
|-
!Tyrone
|''(To Number 3:) ''SSSHH! Don't be rude.'' (To Paper Jam Dipper:) ''Hey, buddy hey. It's okay.
|-
!Paper Jam Dipper
|AAAA-KKKKKKKXXX-KKKKXXX-A.
|-
!Dipper
|Okay. Just one more clone.
|-
!
|''Cut to Pacifica on a stage.''
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Singing:)'' [[Always Means Forever|Always means forever]] (closes eyes), ALWAAAAAYYYSS! ''(her high voice breaks a plastic cup; whispering and points)'' Forever.
|-
!Grenda
|I used to sing like that, before my voice changed.
|-
!Soos
|Pacifica pulls ahead!
|-
!Pacifica
|Try and top that! ''(Hands Mabel the microphone)'' Oh, and Grenda, by the way, you sound like a professional wrestler.
|-
!Grenda
|I WANNA PUT HER IN A HEADLOCK AND MAKE HER FEEL PAIN!
|-
!Mabel
|It's not over 'til it's over, sisters! Watch this. ''(Runs onstage)'' Soos! Give me the 80s-ist, crowd pleasing-ist, rock ballad-y-ist song you got!
|-
!Soos
|''(Puts on Don't Start Un-Believing)''
|-
!Mabel
|Excellent. ''(Singing:)'' Don't start UN-BELIEVING!

Never don't not feel your feelings! ''(Everyone cheers)''

''(Twirls her mic around)''

WATCH ME DO A FLIP! ''(lands on her face)''

THAT WAS FOR YOU GUYS!
|-
!
|''Everyone cheers except Pacifica, who looks at the crowd, and Dipper whispers something in Soos' ear.''
|-
!Soos
|Dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside. It is being stolen right now.
|-
!Robbie
|Wait, WHAT?!
|-
!
|''Clones 3 and 4 ride Robbie's bike away from the shack and laugh.''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Chasing them)'' Hey, come back here!
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Wendy:)'' Oh, tough break. I wonder who those guys are who aren't me because I'm right here.
|-
!Soos
|Now we're gonna bring it down for a minute. Ladies, dudes, now's the time.
|-
!Wendy
|Oh snap, I love this song. ''(Sways her head in time to the music)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs over to Dipper)'' Hey goofus, now's your chance to ask Wen–''(Dipper covers Mabel's mouth. They move away from Wendy)'' Now's your chance to ask Wendy to dance! C'mon! Go!
|-
!Dipper
|Ok, ok. ''(Struggles to go over)'' I-uh,'' (Runs away the opposite direction) ''Uh, I'll be right back!
|-
!
|''Cut to Tyrone and Dipper pacing around each other in the attic''
|-
!Tyrone
|Oh, I agree. You can't just go and DANCE with her.
|-
!Dipper
|The dance floor is a minefield, a MINEFIELD, Tyrone!
|-
!Tyrone
|What if there's a glitch in the sound system?
|-
!Dipper
|Stan might get in the way.
|-
!Tyrone
|Robbie might come back.
|-
!Dipper
|There's too many variables. We need help.
|-
!
|''Dipper makes 6 more clones of himself.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, Dippers! Gather round! Now's the time! You all clear on want to do?
|-
!
|''The clones nod monotonously and leave the attic. Number 10 walks up the Soos.''
|-
!Number 10
|Hey, Soos, look! A glowing dot!
|-
!Soos
|Oh man, I'm so glad I turned my head. That dot does not disappoint.
|-
!
|''While Soos is distracted, number 10 puts in a disc labeled "Wendy Mix." The rest of the clones do their jobs as well. Number 8, who is sitting above the party, puts a dollar on a fishing rod and dangles it in front of Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Right, like I'm gonna fall for that. ''(pretends not to notice, then tries to grab the money) ''GIVE ME THAT... ''(Chases it away)'' MONEY, MONEY!
|-
!
|''While Stan is distracted, Number 6 rings a bell.''
|-
!Tyrone
|There's your cue. It's the perfect moment to ask Wendy to dance. Good luck, me!
|-
!Dipper
|I don't need luck. I have a plan. ''(Leaves attic and sees Wendy in the hallway)'' AH!
|-
!Wendy
|Oh hey, man. What's up?
|-
!Dipper
|W-What are you doing here? I mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor, ''(looks at watch)'' uh, in like exactly 42 seconds?
|-
!Wendy
|I'm just waiting for the bathroom.
|-
!Dipper
|Um, uh, okay. ''(Pulls out his list, to himself:)'' Small talk, small talk, small talk!
|-
!Wendy
|So hey, let's say everyone at this party gets stuck on a desert island. Who do you think the leader would be?
|-
!Dipper
|I, uh...
|-
!Wendy
|I think I'd go with this lunatic. (''Points at a short, sweaty man dancing'')
|-
!Dipper
|Ha, ha, ha. ''(Puts list away)'' I'd probably go for Stretch over there, uh, because tall people can reach coconuts? ''(points at a tall man doing the moonwalk)''
|-
!Wendy
|Speaking of tall, wanna see something? ''(Pulls out a picture with her thumb over one of her [[Corduroy brothers|brothers]])'' Those are my brothers, and I'm, ''(Lifting her thumb)'' boooop.
|-
!Dipper
|Ha, you were a freak! ''(Covers mouth)''
|-
!Wendy
|Yep.
|-
!Dipper
|You know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before I started hiding it all the time.
|-
!Wendy
|Birthmark?
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, no! It's nothing! I-I was-I wa–why did I say that?
|-
!Wendy
|No way, dude! Now you have to show me! Show me, show me!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Lifts his bangs up to show his forehead, revealing a Big Dipper-like birthmark)''
|-
!Wendy
|The Big Dipper! That's how you got your nickname! I thought your parents just hated you or something. Hey, I guess we're both freaks.'' (They clink cups and laugh as Pacifica exits the bathroom)'' Wait here? ''(Goes into the bathroom)''
|-
!Dipper
|Of course.
|-
!Tyrone
|''(Coming in with the rest of the clones behind him)'' Hey! What are you doing up here? Number 10 has been distracting Soos for 15 minutes; he's gonna get tired of that dot eventually!
|-
!Soos
|''(Off-screen:)'' Never!
|-
!Dipper
|You won't believe it guys! I bumped into Wendy accidentally and things are actually going great!
|-
!Tyrone
|That's nice, but not the plan. Do we have to remind you?
|-
!Clones
|''(Read some steps from the list asynchronously)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh man, you guys sound crazy. Look, maybe we don't need the plan anymore, you know? Maybe I could just go talk to her like a normal person.
|-
!Clones
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Number 7
|You bite your tongue!
|-
!Number 5
|If you're not gonna stick to the plan, maybe you shouldn't be the Dipper to dance with Wendy.
|-
!Clones
|Yes/If you think about it... Five/Number Five's got a point.
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, c'mon. We said we weren't gonna turn on each other.
|-
!Tyrone
|I think we all knew we were lying.
|-
!Clones
|''(Grab Dipper and pull him away)''
|-
!Dipper
|No, no, hey, hey! AAAAAH!
|-
!Clones
|''(Throw Dipper in a closet)''
|-
!Dipper
|No, wait!
|-
!Clones
|''(Close the door)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Trying to trick Tyrone) ''Ahh, I can't breath in here!
|-
!Tyrone
|Yes you can! Plus there's snacks and a coloring book in there for you!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sigh, eats a cracker angrily)'' Omnomnom...
|-
!Tyrone
|Okay, now that Original Dipper or "Dipper Classic" is no longer fit for it, I nominate myself to dance with Wendy instead. I've been around the longest, so it should be me. Right? I mean logically. Logically, guys.
|-
!Number 10
|Fair point, fair point. Counterpoint, maybe I should get to dance with Wendy because I've been around her the least.
|-
!Number 5
|That makes, like, zero sense.
|-
!Number 10
|''(Pushes number 5)'' '''YOU''' MAKE ZERO SENSE!
|-
!Number 5
|''(Shoves number 10)'' Watch it!
|-
!Number 6
|''(Shoves number 5)'' Don't shove people!
|-
!Paper Jam Dipper
|NANANANANA-AAAAAAA!
|-
!Tyrone
|Hey, you want some cheese and crackers, buddy?
|-
!Paper Jam Dipper
|KKSSKSKSS.
|-
!Tyrone
|''(Tries to give Paper Jam Dipper a cracker but realizes he has no mouth) ''Yikes.'' (To the rest of the clones:)'' Hey, guys, what would you do if you were trapped in a closet?
|-
!Number 5 to 10
|Break out. ''(Looks at closet to see that it's open)''
|-
!Tyrone
|(''Facepalm)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs down stairs and to balcony)'' WEND-!
|-
!Number 5
|''(Covers his mouth and drags him back to the other clones)''
|-
!Tyrone
|C'mon, man. Give it up. You're overpowered.
|-
!Dipper
|Hold on guys, think about it. We're exact equals mentally and physically. If we start fighting, it'll just go on for infinity.
|-
!
|''As the clones agree, Dipper punches Tyrone. The clones stare at them and there is an awkward pause.''
|-
!Number 9
|CLONE FIGHT! 
|-
!
|''The clones start fighting each other.''
|-
!Number 5
|''(Slapping Dipper)'' Quit hitting myself, quit hitting myself! (''Is tackled by Number 8)''

!
|''Numbers 5 and 8 hold Tyrone back as 10 slaps him in the stomach''
|-
!Tyrone
|Guys guys, c'mon it's me! 
|-
!
|''As the clones fight, Dipper crawls through the crowd and nearly gets away. They notice Dipper and the fight stops.''
|-
!Number 10
|Hey! Classic Dipper's getting away!
|-
!Dipper
|No friends, it's me, Number 7.

!
|''The clones stare at the real Number 7.''

!Number 7

|Get him!

!
|''The clones march toward Dipper cornering him & Dipper backs away from them.''

!Dipper
|Stay back, stay back!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Fires a party popper, which turns on the sprinkler, causing the clones to melt)''
|-
!Clones
|Boo! C'mon! Lame! This stinks! Boo!
|-
!Paper Jam Dipper
|NANANANANANA-KSCKSKSSOSKS ''(Subtitled:)'' It's better this way for Paper Jam Dipper
|-
!Dipper
|Huh, how 'bout that. (''Notices Tyrone standing behind him)''
|-
!Tyrone
|You!
|-
!Dipper
|Uh-oh.

!
|''Cut to the party room. Mabel is doing the worm.''

!Soos
|One more song, dudes, and then it's time for the bestowing of the party crown. It's gonna be the– ''(plays an explosion sound with the keyboard)'' Nailed it.
|-
!Mabel
|Pacifica, I just wanna say that whoever wins, it's been a super fun party.
|-
!Pacifica
|Tsk. Awwww, it thinks it's gonna win. Hey, did you hear that? ''(Mabel cups her hand next to her ear) ''People clapping for the weird girls? Yeah, me neither.

|Let the party crown voting commence! ''(plays bell sound)''
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Sarcastically:)'' Good luck, ''Mabel''.
|-
!Soos
|Applaud to vote for Mabel.

!
|''The crowd applauds loudly.''
|-
!Soos
|Let's check the applause meter. ''(Raises hand)'' Oh, oh, very good.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Smiles'')
|-
!Soos
|And the next contestant: Pacifica.
|-
!
|''The crowd applauds quietly, but Pacifica glares at them angrily. More people reluctantly start to clap for her.''
|-
!Soos
|Uh-oh, a tie! This has like, never happened before.
|-
!Pacifica

!Crowd
|''(Carrying her off)'' Pacifica! Pacifica! Pacifica!
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Grenda and Candy:)'' Sorry I let you guys down. I understand if you wanna leave.
|-
!Candy
|But then, we will miss the sleepover.
|-
!Mabel
|The what?
|-
!Grenda
|We want to call our moms and see if we can sleep over here with you. You're like, a total rock star!
|-
!Candy
|''(Pulls a magazine out of her bag)'' I have magazine boys.
|-
!Mabel
|Really? You GUUYS!
|-
!Candy
|Maybe we don't have as many friends as Pacifica, but we have each other, and that is pretty good I think.
|-
!Mabel
|''(to Soos:)'' Soos! Play another song! This thing's going all night!

!Soos
|Way ahead of you, hambone. ''(Plays a song)''

|-
!Tyrone
|Some night, huh?
|-
!
|''A shooting star flies across the starry night. Dipper and Tyrone open the cans.''
|-
!Dipper
|You think we even have a chance with Wendy? I mean she's 15, we're 12.
|-
!Tyrone
|I don't know man, I hope so, but we're making zero progress the way we're doin' it. The only good conversation you had with her is when you didn't do anything in that list-stuff.
|-
!Dipper
|I know. Mabel was right, I do get in my own way.
|-
!Dipper and Tyrone
|Literally!
|-
!Tyrone
|Wow! ''(makes an explosion sound)''.
|-
!Dipper and Tyrone
|''(Touch cans and drink the soda'')

!Tyrone
|''(Stomach melts)'' Oh boy, don't look now.

!Dipper
|Tyrone!
|-
!Tyrone
|It's okay dude, I had a good run. Remember what we talked about.
|-
!Dipper
|Uh-uh, of course.
|-
!Tyrone
|Hey, and quit being such a wimp around Wendy okay? For my sake... ''(Melts completely)'' BLBLBLBLBLBL!
|-
!Dipper
|Tyrone! You were the only one who understood. ''(Pours soda on where Tyrone melted and drinks what's left. He goes to the front door and looks in the window.)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Counting money)'' Hahaha!
|-
!
|''Soos is playing music and the girls are dancing. Wendy is by the side nodding her head to the beat. Dipper prepares to go in, then stops and rips up the list and goes inside the shack.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! Where have you been? Meet my girlfriends!
|-
!
|''End credits.''

|That's debatable. Aw, come on, what's with all this traffic? And why is it all...covered wagons? Oh no! No! No! ''(Pushes gas pedal)'' Not today! Not today!

|-
![[Unnamed red cap man|Worker]]
|''(Walking by, holding one end of the pane of dirty glass)'' Dirty glass. We got dirty glass! Dirty glass.

!Stan
|Ah, boy. It's [[Pioneer Day]]. Every year these yahoos dress up like idiots to celebrate the day [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] was founded.

|I'm sorry to break it to you, but Pioneer Day is for serious people, and you look and act ridiculous. ''(Looking at Mabel's sweater)'' I mean, a puppy playing basketball? Are you always this silly?
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, I can be serious! ''(Glares)''
|-
!Pacifica
|You do have nachos hanging from your ears, hon.

|-
!Stan
|Hey there, uh, donkey boy! Give me a hand with my car, huh?
|-
!Steve
|Here in 1863, I have never heard-tell of a "car." Pray-tell, what is this magic wheel box?
|-
!Stan
|Ah, c'mon, Steve, you're a mechanic for Pete's sake! Cut me some slack.
|-
!Steve
|"Slack?" I am unfamiliar with this ''bold'', new expression.

!Stan
|I can't take this anymore! ''(Grabs Steve by the collar)'' I'm getting dumber every second I'm here!

!Dipper
|Uh, nnnoooo?

!Mabel
|I knew it! The nacho earrings, the sweater. I thought I was being charming, but I guess people see me as a big joke. ''(Throws off her nacho earrings, takes off her sweater, and ties her sweater around her waist)''

!Dipper
|C'mon, Mabel, you love that sweater!
|-
!Mabel
|I did before Pacifica ruined it for me. She ruins everything!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Stands up, turns around, and glares at the statue)'' Pacifica! Why does she think that being related to the town founder means she can treat everyone like garbage. Someone needs to take her down a peg. ''(Gasps)'' Wait a minute! I feel like I read something about Pacifica's great-great grandfather before. ''(Opens ''Journal 3'')'' Of course! Oh, this is perfect. ''(In a deep voice:)'' In my investigations... ''(Normal voice:)'' Should- should I do the voice?
|-
!Mabel
|Nuh uh.
|-
!Dipper
|I'll just read... normal. ''(Reading from journal:)'' In my investigations I recently made a discovery. Nathaniel Northwest may not be the true founder of Gravity Falls! I believe this secret is emburied somewhere on the enclosed document. If only I could crack the code. ''(Opens the document, revealing a complex series of letters, symbols and words)'' Oh, man! If this cover-up is true, it means Pacifica's whole family is a fraud. This could be a major conspiracy!
|-
!Mabel
|Really?
|-
!Dipper
|I got to investigate this!
|-
!Mabel
|Wait! I'm coming with you. Conspiracies are serious, right?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh yeah, definitely.
|-
!Mabel
|Well, if I help you crack this code, then nobody could call me silly again!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah! Mystery twins?
|-
!Mabel
|I thought you hated that.
|-
!Dipper
|I'm starting to accept it.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Fist bump and run off)''
|-
!Blubs
|''(Behind the statue, into a walkie-talkie:)'' This is Sheriff Blubs. We've got a code sepia!
|-
!Dispatcher
|''(Spits out coffee)'' What?! And what are you doing about it?
|-
!Blubs
|I'm following them right now.
|-
!Dispatcher
|Find them and stop them. There's no room for error.
|-
!Blubs
|I understand. Blubs out. ''(To Durland:)'' Deputy Durland, maintaining this cover-up is the mission we've been training for our entire careers. Are you ready?
|-
!Durland
|''(Ringing bell)'' Woo!
|-
!Blubs
|Hehe, if being delightful was crime, you'd be breaking the law.
|-
!Durland
|Let's go get 'em!
|-
!
|''Cuts to inside the [[Gravity Falls Library]].''
|-
!McGucket
|Back in the olden days, pioneers drew subsistence from telling stories 'round the fire. So let's eat some books, children! Go ahead, eat the books! ''(Chews a book)''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, Mabel, if we can prove Nathaniel Northwest wasn't the real founder of Gravity Falls, it will finally put Pacifica in her place.
|-
!Mabel
|And solving a mystery will prove that I'm not silly. I'm serious. Seeeeriousss... ''(Laps up candy from the table into her mouth with her tongue)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Places some slides into a projector)'' We just need to crack this code. Let me see... it's not Egyptian, it's not numerology, it's not, wait-of course! The triangle is the alchemist symbol for flame. Lighting the parchment on fire will reveal the secret message!
|-
!Mabel
|It's so obvious!
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, let's just light this sucker up and--- Mabel!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Now wearing a hat she made out of the document)'' Mwop! I just made a hat. Ugh, I just did something silly again. ''(Blows a raspberry)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, Mabel. You folded it into a map! And I was gonna ''burn'' it...
|-
!Blubs
|''(To a [[Unnamed librarian|librarian]]:)'' We're on the lookout for two kids who might be reading.
|-
!Durland
|We're hunting them down for secret reasons! ''(Rings bell)'' WOO! 
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Hide under the table.)''
|-
!Durland
|''(Knocks row of books off a shelf)'' DERP!
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' Maybe we should take this elsewhere...
|-
!Mabel
|This map should lead us to... ''(Cut to the twins standing in front of a [[Gravity Falls Museum of History|museum]].)'' ...The Gravity Falls Museum of History.
|-
!Dipper
|You realize what this means, Mabel. ''(Looks up and squints.)'' We're gonna have to break in.
|-
!
|''Dramatic music plays. Cut to Dipper and Mabel inside the museum at the entrance.''
|-
![[Sue]]
|...And here are your free Pioneer Day passes, and your balloons, blue and pink. ''(Hands them balloons)''
|-
!
|''Dramatic music plays.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Still looking up and squinting)'' We're in.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Walking through museum)'' What are we gonna do next, steal Thomas Jefferson's rib cage?
|-
!Dipper
|Ewww, no. According to the map, the next clue about the real town founder should be right... here!
|-
!
|''A triangular exhibition piece is mounted on the wall.''
|-
!Dipper
|We've gotta figure this one out quick, I have a feeling those cops weren't at the library to check out books...
|-
!Mabel
|I don't think the one with the bell can read...
|-
!Dipper
|So what is it anyway?
|-
!
|''The twins analyze the exhibit.''
|-
!Both
|Hmmmm...
|-
!
|''Mabel gets bored and walks over to a bench to sit down.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Walks over to a bench and sits down; turning upside-down on the bench)'' Hey painting, be less stupid! ''(Gasps)'' It worked!
|-
!Dipper
|Huh? ''(Runs over and lays upside-down on the bench)'' Wait! It's not abstract, it's upside-down!
|-
!Mabel
|I think I've seen that statue at the [[Gravity Falls Cemetery|cemetery]].
|-
!Dipper
|Let's go! Quick!
|-
!Both
|''(Stand up and get dizzy, holding their heads)'' Ow.
|-
!Dipper
|Head rush.
|-
!Sue
|''(To Deputy Durland:)'' I'm sorry, but we're all out of pink balloons.
|-
!Durland
|''(Disappointed:)'' Why did we even come?
|-
!Dispatcher
|''(Over walkie-talkie:)'' Officer Blubs.
|-
!Blubs
|''(Runs into the museum so that they're out of earshot; using walkie-talkie:)'' Blubs here.
|-
!Dispatcher
|Have the targets been apprehended? 
|-
!Blubs
|Negative, but we're close. I promise, those kids'll never get past us.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Run past them)''
|-
!Blubs
|Hey! Wait!
|-
!
|''Blubs and Durland chase the kids out of the museum, but get stuck in the door.''
|-
!Blubs
|Dang it!
|-
!
|''Cut to the Woodpecker and husband's house.''
|-
!Woodpecker guy
|For the last time, we are ''not'' going south for the winter! Our home is here!
|-
!Woodpecker
|''(Pecks the table)''
|-
!Woodpecker guy
|You ''always'' say that! ''(Storms out of the house)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Struggling to get out of the stocks, trying to unlock the lock with a hairpin in his mouth)'' C'mon! C'mon, ugh! ''(Drops pin)''
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Picks up the pin)'' Well, if it isn't Mabel's uncle, Mr. Pines. Looking for this? ''(Holds up the pin)''
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, yeah. What d' ya want, money?
|-
!Pacifica
|I want you to say that the Northwest family is the best family in Gravity Falls.
|-
!Stan
|Oh sure, you want that in writing?
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Gives Stan a pen and let him writes something on a note with his mouth)''
|-
!Stan
|There you go. ''(The note says "YOU STINK!")'' Ha! I did that with my mouth!
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Whistles, catching the attention of people with tomatoes, and points to Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|Aw, come on!
|-
!
|''Cuts to Dipper and Mabel in the cemetery. Dipper is looking at the statue that is pointing off in the distance.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah... The statue must be pointing to the next clue. ''(Looks in direction statue is pointing but then turns back when Mabel speaks up)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(The finger of the statue sticking in her nose)'' Oh, gross! She's picking my nose! Ha ha! ''(The tip of the statue's finger bends upward, opening a secret door in the grave)'' Ach.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, look!
|-
!Mabel
|Ha! Who's silly now, Pacifica? Bam! ''(Tries to jump down from statue but her nose is still there so the finger tugs on her nose)'' Ahh! Ow. Ow. Ow. ''(Getting down from the statue)'' Okay.
|-
!Mabel
|Now we're getting into real conspiracy mode. I feel serious. Mmm. ''(Eats candy)''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, look out for booby traps.
|-
!Mabel
|Ha! Booby traps. ''(Steps on a tile that triggers a bunch of darts to fly out of the wall towards her and Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|Tranquilizer darts! ''(Grabs Mabel's hand and maneuvers through the darts)''
|-
!Mabel
|Aah!
|-
!
|''They dodge the darts and fall down a path that leads them to a small set-up filled with confidential, historical information.''
|-
!Mabel
|It's a treasure trove of historic-y, secret-y things. ''(Picks up a top-secret document. The first page is about the secret of Abraham Lincoln's hat, and shows a picture of [[wikipedia:Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in his top hat in one picture, and him without his top hat, with a hand sticking out of the top of his head, in the other. Mabel looks at the next page, where there is a picture of [[wikipedia:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]] wearing earrings, and the sub-caption says that he was secretly a woman)'' Oh, man! Ben Franklin secretly ''was'' a woman!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Finding and picking up a [[Northwest Cover-up|document]] titled "Northwest Cover-up")'' Hey, jackpot! Now we'll find out who the real town founder was. ''(Reading from document:)'' "Let it be here recorded that Nathaniel Northwest, fabled founder of Gravity Falls, was, in fact, a fraud...as well as a waste-shoveling village ''idiot''"? ''(Laughs)'' Oh, bad news for Pacifica. Wait'll the papers hear about this!
|-
!Mabel
|Once people see that I uncovered a historical conspiracy, they can never call me silly!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading from document:)'' "The true founder of Gravity Falls was sir lord, [[Quentin Trembley|Quentin Trembley, III, Esquire]]."
|-
!Mabel
|Who's Quentin Trembley?
|-
!Blubs
|''That's'' none of your business!
|-
!Durland
|Whoo! We gotcha! Whoo! ''(Weakly:)'' Whoo! Hmm whoo-hoo. ''(Passes out. Several tranquilizer darts are sticking out of his back and head)''
|-
!Blubs
|He got hit with quite a few of those darts.
|-
!
|''Commercial break''
|-
!Blubs
|But Quentin Trembley's a matter of national security.
|-
!Durland
|Yeah! Ye--ah ''(Puts hands on knees)'' woo. I think I might be colorblind now.
|-
!Dipper
|What do you mean, "national security?"
|-
!Mabel
|And who is Quentin Trembley, anyway?
|-
!Blubs
|See for yourself. ''(Removes hat and takes out a reel of film. He puts it into a projector, and the projection screen shows a countdown in black and white)''
|-
!Mabel
|Aww, it's black and white?!
|-
!Dipper
|Shh! Mabel.
|-
!
|''Reel starts, revealing a government official in an office.''
|-
!Govt. official
|If you're watching this, then you are one of eight people in these United States with clearance to view this information. In fact, I myself will be shot as soon as the filming is complete. ''(Looks offscreen)'' --What? No? Ho! Well, that's a relief! ''(Looks back at the camera)'' Of all of America's secrets, the most embarrassing was that of Quentin Trembley: The eighth-and-a-half president of the United States.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|President?
|-
!Mabel
|Eighth-and-a-half?
|-
!Govt. official
|After winning the 1837 election in a landslide, ''(On the video, a picture of Quentin Trembley standing next to the other presidential candidates is shown. A landslide kills the other candidates)'' Quentin Trembley quickly gained a reputation as America's silliest president.
He waged war on pancakes, appointed six babies to the supreme court, and issued the de-pants-ipation proclamation. His state of the union speech was even worse.
|-
!Trembley ''(reenacted recording)''
|The only thing we have to fear is gigantic, man-eating spiders!
|-
!Govt. official
|He was kicked out of office and escaped to an uncharted valley he named [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]], after plummeting into it at high speed.
Trembley's shameful term was erased from history and officially replaced by [[wikipedia:William Henry Harrison|William Henry Harrison]] as President and local nobody Nathaniel Northwest as founder of Gravity Falls.
The whereabouts of president Trembley's body are unknown.
|-
!Blubs
|Until now.
|-
!
|''Cut to Quentin Trembley, who is encased in an amber-colored rectangle.''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Is that, like, amber or something?
|-
!Blubs
|The fool thought he could live forever by encasing himself in a block of solid peanut brittle. Smooth move, Mr. President! Finding Trembley's body was our special mission. And now, thanks to you, it's complete.
|-
!Durland
|Who knew all we had to do was follow a little girl's ''(Holds up one of Mabel's candy wrappers)'' trail of candy wrappers?
|-
!Mabel
|Ugh, ''(Face-palms)'' silly!
|-
!Blubs
|Now that you know the truth, well, we can't let you go around talkin' about it.
|-
!Dipper
|Does that mean--?
|-
!Mabel
|Are you going to kill us?!
|-
!Durland
|OH NO!
|-
!Blubs
|No, no. ''(To Durland:)'' Calm down now, buddy, calm down. ''(To the twins:)'' We're just gonna escort you and all this stuff back to Washington. You ain't comin' back, by the way.
|-
!
|''Cut to the inside of a train''
|-
!Durland
|''(Unfolds fold-out bed)'' Woo-hoo! We got fold-out beds!
|-
!Blubs
|''(Opens suitcase and pulls out book)'' Good thing I brought my book of spooky ghost stories!
|-
!Durland
|''(Takes out colored rope)'' I brought rope for friendship bracelets!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel who are trapped in a crate with Quentin Trembley's body.''
|-
!Mabel
|Anyone there?! Help help help!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! Let us out!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh. I can't believe I left a trail of candy wrappers. This is all my fault. Pacifica had me pegged all along. I'm just a silly failure, like that embarrassing president what's-his-name. ''(Eats piece of peanut brittle, breaking the block and freeing Trembley)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Aahh!
|-
!Trembley
|It is I, Quentin Trembley. ''(Rips off pants)''
|-
!Dipper
|You're alive! But how?
|-
!Mabel
|Peanut brittle really ''does'' have life-sustaining properties! You're not silly, you're brilliant!
|-
!Trembley
|And so are you, dear girl, for following my clues and freeing me from my delicious tomb!
|-
!Dipper
|He's right! Making maps into hats, hanging upside-down; Your silliness solved the code that serious cops couldn't crack in a hundred years!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, stop it.
|-
!Trembley
|By Jefferson! We seem to be trapped in some sort of crate-shaped box.
|-
!Mabel
|It's a crate, Mr. President.
|-
!Trembley
|''(Pulls out key)'' Good thing I have the President's Key, which can open any lock in America! ''(Repeatedly slams it at the side of the crate)''
|-
!Dipper
|I... don't think that's gonna work.
|-
!Trembley
|Wood! My age-old enemy. In order to get out of here, this is going to take the silliest plan ever conceived.
|-
!Dipper
|I think I know who can help you. ''(Smiles at Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hmm. How 'bout... that hole? ''(Points to tiny hole near the corner of the crate)''
|-
!Trembley
|We will leap ''through'' it!
|-
!Trembley and Mabel
|''(Jump at the hole)''
|-
!Trembley
|''(To Mabel, who's poking her finger through hole and moving it around:)'' Almost. Almost there Good! Keep pushing.
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not sure this is working.
|-
!Mabel
|Trust... the silliness!
|-
!Trembley
|Fiddlesticks! Keep going!
|-
!
|''A woodpecker flies in and pecks at the crate, making a tapping noise.''
|-
!Trembley
|Is that my third wife? Sandy?
|-
!
|''The box falls apart.''
|-
!Trembley
|Well, we didn't fit through the hole. Let's rebuild the box and try again!
|-
!Dipper
|We gotta get out of here!
|-
!Trembley
|Also good!
|-
!
|''Dipper opens a door in the train and Durland, who is getting ice, sees the three of them and drops the bucket of ice.''
|-
!Durland
|Blubs!
|-
!
|''Dipper, Mabel, and Trembley run away. They climb up a ladder to get to the emergency escape. Trembley pulls out his key and starts pressing it against the door even though there's no lock.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Taking the key from Trembley)'' Give me that! (''Turns the handle and they all run out onto the roof of the train, followed by Blubs and Durland)''
|-
!Blubs
|There ''(Huffs)'' is ''(Huffs)'' no ''(Huffs)'' escape! I gotta take a knee.
|-
!Durland
|Are you okay? Can I get you anything?
|-
!Blubs
|Edwin, darlin', you are a diamond in the rough.
|-
!Dipper
|Sheriff Blubs, do you really want to lock us all up in a government facility somewhere?
|-
!Blubs
|I've got no choice! Our orders come from the very top!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait! Quentin, did you ever sign an official resignation?
|-
!Trembley
|No, sir. I ate a salamander and jumped out the window.
|-
!Dipper
|Then... technically you're still legally the President of the United States, right? ''(To Blubs and Durland:)'' You've gotta answer to ''this'' guy now!
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|Huh?
|-
!Trembley
|As president of these several United States, I hereby order you to pretend none of this ever happened. And- and go on a delightful vacation. ''(As the train goes by he hits his head on a metal rail)'' Ow! Mmm yeeees!
|-
!Blubs
|Vacation? ''(To Durland:)'' What place have you always wanted to visit? One, two--
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|Silly Water Fun Slides in Grand Lakes, Michigan!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, and Trembley outside of the train. Durling and Blubs are in the train wearing Hawaiian shirts and wave to the three as the train departs.''
|-
!
Blubs and Durland
|Bye-bye! Bye!
|-
!Trembley
|''(Once the train is gone, he gets to a knee and looks at Mabel)'' You've done a great service to your country, Mabel. As thanks, I'd like to make you an official U.S. congressman. ''(Unfolds a black top-hat and hands it to Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Puts on hat)'' I'm legalizing everything!
|-
!Trembley
|''(To Dipper:)'' And Roderick, 
|-
!Dipper
|Uh- actually- uh-
|-
!Trembley
|You dear boy are on your way to unlocking the mysteries of this great land. So I'd like you to have my [[President's Key]]!
|-
!
|''Cut to Trembley and the twins later on, back in Gravity Falls. Trembley is telling a story.''
|-
!Trembley
|And then he chased me around and spanked me with a paddle for, like, three hours. Bottom line, [[wikipedia:George Washington|George Washington]] was a ''jerk''.
|-
!Mabel
|A-greed!
|-
!
|''Cut to Pacifica and [[Pacifica's friends|her friends]] watching girls run around a small maypole.''
|-
![[Shmipper and Smabble|Smabble]]
|''(Trips, but saves herself so that she doesn't fall onto the ground)'' Oh!
|-
!Pacifica
|''(To her friends:)'' Kick her off the team.
|-
!
|''Pacifica's friends walk away to do as she said. Mabel approaches Pacifica.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, Pacifica! I uncovered a government conspiracy about the eighth-and-a-half president of the United States! Who's silly now?
|-
!Pacifica
|What? Who is that idiot?
|-
!
|''Cut to Trembley, who has his fists up and is chasing after a bald eagle.''
|-
!Trembley
|Put up your dukes, you bald fiend!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Mabel and Pacifica.''
|-
!Mabel
|The eighth-and-a-half president of America. How is he still alive? Well, turns out you can hibernate in peanut brittle and it--
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Bursts out into laughter)'' Wow! You really are a sad, dumb little girl. Nice top hat, by the way.
|-
!
|''[[Preston Northwest|Preston]] and [[Priscilla Northwest]] laugh mockingly.''
|-
!Preston Northwest
|''(Laughs)'' Good one, daughter.
|-
!Pacifica
|Ooh! I see your car is stuck in the mud. ''(Gets into sedan)'' Enjoy walking home!
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' Aren't you gonna tell her about her ''ate-gray ampa-gray''?
|-
!Mabel
|You know what, Dipper? I've got nothing to prove. I've learned to see silly as awesome!
|-
!Dipper
|Well, I haven't learned anything! ''(Whistles)'' Hey, Pacifica!
|-
!
|''Dipper runs to the Northwests' sedan. The car stops and Dipper hands Pacifica the documents on the Northwest cover-up through the window.''
|-
!Dipper
|Nathaniel Northwest didn't found Gravity Falls, and your whole family is a sham. Deal with it!
|-
!
|''Car drives away, and Pacifica looks out the back window, shocked.''
|-
!Pacifica
|What?! Moooom!!!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Now back at Mabel's side)'' Man, revenge is underrated. That felt ''awesome!''
|-
!Trembley
|Children, I am needed elsewhere. Just know that I'll always be right here... ''(Pulls out [[Negative Twelve Dollar Bill|bill]])'' On the negative twelve dollar bill. ''(Hands Dipper bill)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Examines bill)'' Whoa. This is worthless.
|-
!Trembley
|It's ''less'' then worthless, my boy. Trembley away!
|-
!
|''Trembley jumps backwards onto a horse and rides away.''
|-
!Mabel
|Where do you think he's going?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm gonna say... off a cliff.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan, who is telling to the twins the story of his imprisonment.''
|-
!Stan
|And then [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] came by and talked to me for like, an ''hour''.
|-
!Mabel
|You've been through so much.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Uses President's key to unlock the lock on the stocks and freeing Stan)'' It works!
|-
!Stan
|''(To Mabel:)'' So what's with the top hat?
|-
!Mabel
|I am a congressman.
|-
!Stan
|Pardon me?
|-
!Mabel
|You are officially pardoned.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel laugh, to Stan's befuddlement.''
|-
!Stan
|Oy! You a never gonna make sense, are you, kid?
|-
!Mabel
|No, I'm not, Grunkle Stan. No, I'm not. Mabel, away! ''(Jumps backward)''
|-
!
|''Crashing sound.''
|-
!Mabel
|I'm okay!
|-
!
|''Cut to end tag. Trembley is in a courtroom talking to babies with mustaches wearing top hats.''
|-
!Trembley
|Esteemed gentlemen of the Supreme Court of the United States, I implore you to rethink your decision!
|-
!
|''The babies just sit there making cooing noises.''
|-
!Trembley
|Very well. But who would you have replace me?
|-
!Baby
|Mama.
|-
!Trembley
|That old crone?!
|-
!Baby
|Ba ba ba...
|-
!Trembley
|Chief Justice Num-Num, y-you're spitting up on yourself! Now ohh! Oh, come on! This is a courtroom! I... this... this is a dark day for America.

|Maybe some magical creature or paranormal thing-um took it.

|-
!Dipper
|Eh, it's no big deal.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, it is!
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, you're right, it is! Isn't this amazing? I just dove in! I said, "Hey! You wanna hang out at the fair?" And you know what she said?

|''Flashback to Dipper and Wendy in the gift shop''
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, I guess so.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present''
|-
!Dipper
|"Yeah, I guess so!" It totally worked! All your advice about just going for it, it's finally paying off!
|-
!Mabel
|When are you gonna learn, Dipper? I'm always right about everything! Hey, do you smell a gallon of body spray?
|-
![[Robbie Valentino]]
|''(Walks up)'' Hey, have either of you dorks seen Wendy around?
|-
!Dipper
|Who wants to know?
|-
!Robbie

|-
!Mabel
|Hey!
|-
!Robbie
|Yeah, I got some new super tight jeans. ''(thrusts)'' Thought she might want to check 'em out.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah! You know, I think I saw her in the Bottomless Pit. You should really go jump in there.
|-
!Robbie
|Maybe I will, smart guy. ''(Bumps Dipper on his way away)''
|-
!Mabel
|He is such a jerk.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, but he's a jerk with tight pants and a guitar. I need to keep him away from Wendy at all costs.
|-
!Mabel
|I'll be there with you, brother. Whatever happens, I'll be right here, supporting you every step of the–OH MY GOSH, A PIG!! (''Runs frantically and bumps several people on the way to the pigpen'')

!Wendy
|Whoa, check it out! I don't know if it's a duck or a panda, but I want one!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks up to ball toss game)'' My uncle taught me the secret to these games. You aim for the carnie's head, and take the prize when he's unconscious.
|-
!Wendy
|Ha ha ha! Nice!

|-
!Ball game carnie

!Dipper
|And a-one and a-two and a-three! ''(Throws ball; it misses, bounces back, and hits Wendy in the eye)''
|-
!Wendy
|AH! MY EYE!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Wendy! Are you okay?
|-
!Wendy
|Does it look swollen? ''(She has a black eye)''
|-
!Dipper
|Everything's gonna be fine! Don't worry! I'll-I'll go get some ice! ''(runs to ice box, gets ice)'' Where is she, where is she? ''(Runs into [[Blendin Blandin]] and drops ice; scrapes it into the bag)'' Hey, watch where you're going, man!
|-
!Blendin
|''(Grabs time machine and runs off)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Finishes scraping ice into bag and starts toward Wendy; stops when he hears Robbie)''
|-
!Robbie
|Just ease your eyeball into that freezy cone.
|-
!Wendy
|''(With her eye in a snow cone)'' Robbie, thanks. That's really sweet. The gesture, and the flavored syrup.
|-
!Robbie
|Yeah, I was just here at the right place at the right time. Y'know, I've been meaning to ask you.. we've been spending a lot of time together and I was wondering if, maybe, you want to go out with me?
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, I guess so.
|-
!Robbie
|Sweet!
|-
!
|''Dipper is horrified. A balloon shaped like a heart is popped by a dart behind him. All the ice falls out of the bag.''

!Mabel
|''(Comes up to Dipper with Waddles)'' Look, Dipper! I won my pet pig! His name is Waddles. I call 'im that because he waddles! ''(Shakes Waddles)'' Waaaaaaaa-dddllleeessss!

!Dipper
|Everything is different now.
|-
!Mabel
|What are you lookin' at?
|-
!Dipper

|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, do you ever wish you could go back and undo just one mistake?
|-
!Mabel
|Nope! I do everything right, all the time! ''(Moves Waddles' arms around)'' Wa! Wa! Ee! Ee! Wawawa!
|-
!Dipper
|I mean Wendy only went out with Robbie because he was there with the ice, and she needed the ice because of the baseball, and I would've had the ice if it wasn't for... ''(gasp)'' that guy! ''(to Blendin Blandin)'' Hey, you! Toolbelt! You ruined my life! ''(walks up to him)''

!Mabel
|That's amazing! Are you from the future or something?
|-
!Blendin
|Uh, NO!! Who told you that?! MEMORY WIPE! ''(Throws baby wipe in Mabel's face)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looks at it)'' This is a baby wipe.
|-
!Blendin
|All right, you've cornered me. I'm... a time traveler.
|-
!Dipper
|So wait a minute, if you're from the future, do you have like a time machine, or something?

|That's... kinda how it works.

!Dipper
|Come on, can I use your [[Tape measure time machine|time machine]] just once?
|-
!Blendin
|No! Out of the question! You know, this is sensitive extremely complicated time equipment. ''(pulls out tape measure to show them)''
|-
!Dipper
|It looks like a tape measure.
|-
!Blendin
|You shut your time-mouth!
|-
!Dipper
|''(to Mabel:)'' This making any sense to you?
|-
!Mabel
|I think he's just crazy.
|-
!Blendin
|Oh! You don't believe me? ''(pulls tape measure, disappears, then reappears a few seconds later in old fashioned clothes)'' Guess where I was!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Whoa!
|-
!Blendin
|That's right! 15 years ago there was a costume shop right here! One second. ''(disappears, then reappears in his normal suit, which is flaming)'' Ah! Aw, heck! Pat! Pat down! ''(pats the fire out)''
|-
!Mabel
|So, who are you again?
|-
!Blendin
|Blendin Blandin, Time Anomaly Removal Crew year twenty sñeventy-twelve. My mission is to stop a series of time anomalies that are suppose to happen at this very location! But-but I don't see any anomalies! I don't know if it's some kind of paradox, or I'm just really tired... ''(sits down)''
|-
!Dipper
|You know, you sound like you could use a break.
|-
!Mabel
|Definitely, definitely. Might we recommend one of the various attractions at the Mystery Fair?
|-
!Blendin
|''(gets up) ''You know what? What the heck! I'm worth it! ''(starts to leave)'' But I've got my eye on you! Ehhh... ehhh... ''(arrives at the barrel ride, which Soos is operating)'' One please.
|-
!Soos
|Uh, sorry dude but you're gonna have to take your belt off for the ride. One of your tools might fly off and accidentally fix something.
|-
!Blendin
|''(Gives it to him)'' Guard it with your life.
|-
!Soos
|I will watch it like a hawk, dude. ''(Starts ride and sets the belt on the barrel at his side)''

|Here it is, Mabel. Our ticket to any moment in history.
|-
!Mabel
|Let's go get two dodos and force them to make out!
|-
!Dipper
|No! We gotta be smart about this. All that paradox talk kinda freaked me out. All I'm gonna do is go back and fix my one mistake. If I don't miss that base ball throw, I won't hit Wendy in the eye, and Robbie won't comfort her, and they won't start going out.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm coming, too! I wanna relive the greatest moment in my life: winning Waddles. ''(kisses Waddles)''

!Waddles
|Oink-oink!

!Mabel
|Ooooooohhhhhhh! ''(picks him up)'' Your face is so fat!

!Dipper
|Like there's one variable missing...
|-
!Mabel
|What's a variable?
|-
!Dipper
|That's it! I've figured out to win the toss, not hit Wendy, and stop Wendy and Robbie from going out!
|-
!Mabel
|Great! I'm gonna go win my pig again. ''(walks off)''

!Dipper
|''(Sigh)'' Wendy, I just wanted to say that, well I just wanted say that people makes mistakes, and when they do, you should forgive them. And also that tight pants are overrated.
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, you lost me. 
|-
!Dipper
|I know... ''(to carnie:)'' One ball, please.
|-
!Ball game Carnie
|You only get one chance.
|-
!Dipper
|And a-one and a-two and a-huh! ''(throws ball, hits Wendy)''
|-
!Wendy
|AUUGH! MY EYE!!
|-
!Robbie
|Hey, Wendy are you okay? You know this is the perfect time for me to ah... ask you something..
|-
!Dipper
|It is done.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Attacks him in a hug and lifts him up)'' DIPPER!!!! THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!! Hmmm!
|-
!Waddles
|''(Oinks the sound similar to "thank you")''
|-
!Mabel
|He's saying thank you in Pig! Aren't you, Waddles?
|-
!Waddles
|''(Oinks "thank you" two times and turns body around and kicks his legs)''
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Being pecked by a chicken) ''Ow-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!...
|-
!Dipper
|I couldn't break your heart, Mabel. Besides, there's no way Wendy can date Robbie all summer, right?
|-
!Blendin
|''(takes time machine)'' YOU TWO!!!!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|AAAGH!
|-
!Waddles
|WEEE!
|-
!Blendin
|Do you have any idea, how many rules you just broke?! I'm asking; I wasn't there with you... it was probably a lot, right?
|-
!Dundgren
|''([[Lolph and Dundgren|he and Lolph]] appear next to Blendin)'' Blendin Blandin...
|-
!Blendin
|AAAAGH! The [[Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron|Time Paradox Avoidment Enforcement Squadron]]!!
|-
!Lolph
|That's right, and our phones have been ringing off the hook! There are settlers high-fiving in the 1800's and calculators littered through eight centuries!
|-
!Dundgren
|You're under arrest for violation of the Time Traveler's Code of Conduct. ''(handcuffs him and leads him away)''
|-
!Blendin
|It was those kids! And their leader, Waddles!
|-
!Lolph
|That's a pig, Blendin.
|-
!Blendin
|''(to Dipper and Mabel:)'' I'll get you for this! I'll go back in time and make sure your [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|parents]] never MEET!!
|-
!Dipper
|Well, we're still here.
|-
!Mabel
|Guess he forgot to go back.
|-
!Stan
|Ha, you suckers! Your pockets are empty and I'm still sittin' high and dry!
|-
!Crowd
|BOOOO!!!!
|-
!Stan
|Boo! Ha, boo! I love it! Hey, biceps! I'm talking to you, haircut! Take you best shot!
|-
!Lolph
|''(shoots Stan down and leaves)''
|-
!Crowd
|YYAAAAYY!
|-
!Mabel
|So I guess we never found out who was causing those time anomalies Blendin was looking for.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, Mabel; I think it was us.
|-
!Mabel
|Ugh, my brain hurts.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, geez, I gotta deal with this all summer?
|-
!Robbie
|''(feeding Wendy caramel apple)'' It's good; it's caramel.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm on it. ''(points Waddles at the apple)''
|-
!Waddles
|HUH! ''(runs at Robbie, making him drop the apple. Waddles eats it.)''
|-
!Robbie
|''(backs into a table and spills a buck of hot water on himself)'' My pants! They're shrinking!
|-
!
|''Everyone laughs.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Laughs) ''Oh man.
|-
!Dipper
|That'll do pig, That'll do.
|-
!
|''Cut to end credits.''
|-
!Time Baby
|''(suspending Blendin in a void)'' You have broken the eternal laws of space time!
|-
!Blendin
|I beg your mercy, Time Baby!
|-
!Time Baby
|You now must clean up all the anomalies!

|-
!Soos Ramirez
|This is it dudes, my favorite place in [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]. Everything I know, I learned right here. A frog taught me how to cross a street. When my house was haunted, I learned how to eat ghosts. And this thing taught me how to dance.
|-
![[Old Man McGucket]]
|''(Dancing on an out of order dancing machine)'' Woo-hoo-hoo! I've been jiggin' here for seven days straight!
|-
!Mabel Pines
|''(Picks up the plug to the dance machine)'' Uh, Soos?
|-
!Soos
|Let him have this.
|-
!Stan Pines

|-
!Game voice
|Congratulations! You win!

|I'm gonna punch the ref.
|-
!Game announcer
|Fight!
|-
!Dipper
|Let's gang up on him.
|-
!
|''Rumble and Dr. Karate do all of the combo moves so that they aren't hitting each other but it looks as though they are hitting the referee.''
|-
!Wendy
|Hohoho.
|-
!
|''[[Robbie Valentino|Robbie]] is nearby, putting up a flyer.''
|-
!'''Dipper and Wendy'''
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Robbie Valentino
|Wendy! What's up, babe? Yeah, just putting up some flyers for [[Robbie V. and the Tombstones|my band]]. I'm playing lead guitar. No biggie.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks skeptically at the picture of Robbie on the poster)'' Are you wearing mascara?
|-
!Robbie
|Uh, it's eye-paint for men.
|-
!Wendy
|Hey Robbie, Dipper was just showing me this great game.
|-
!Robbie
|Ha, yeah, sweet, sweet. (''To Dipper:)'' Hey, how about you sit this one out, okay champ?
|-
!Dipper
|But we just started this round.
|-
!Robbie
|''(Defensively:)'' Whoa, whoa, hey! Relax man, I'm just trying to spend a little time with my ''girlfriend'', alright?
|-
!Wendy
|''(To Dipper:)'' It'll just be one round.
|-
!Game announcer
|Round Three! Fight!
|-
!
|''Wendy and Robbie start playing the game and talking.''
|-
!Wendy
|So hey, I'm gonna go camping tomorrow with my [[Manly Dan|dad]] so, I won't be around.
|-
!Robbie
|Oh, cool, cool, watch out! (''Puts his arm over Wendy's shoulder and subtly glares at Dipper'')
|-

|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Cut to [[Mystery Shack]], where Stan, Dipper, Mabel and Soos are playing poker.''

!Mabel
|King me! ''(Reveals her hand which has two Kings)''
|-
!Stan, Soos, Dipper
|Aww! Come on!
|-
!Stan
|It's not fair, she doesn't even know what we're playing!
|-
!Mabel
|Go Fish?
|-
!
|''Electric guitar starts playing outside the shack.''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, I think I'm picking up a radio station inside my head.
|-
!Mabel 
|Try blinking to see if you can change the channel.
|-
!Soos
|''(Blinks)''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Offscreen; singing:)'' Weeendy!
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, sounds like Robbie.
|-
!Stan
|Robbie? Is he that jerky twerp I see making goo-goo eyes at Wendy all the time?
|-
!Soos 
|He called me "Big Dude" once. I mean, I know I'm a big dude, but it kinda hurt.
|-
!Mabel 
|Should I sic [[Waddles]] on him again?
|-
!Waddles
|''(Chews Mabel's sweater)''
|-
!Mabel
| Whoa, easy tiger. 
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gets up)'' I'll handle it. ''(Leaves)''
|-
!Stan, Mabel and Soos
|Ooooooh!
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha, conflict!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Singing:)'' Wendy! Wendy, Wendy! ''(Shouting:)'' Wendy! C'mon out, girl! C'mon down!
|-
!Dipper 
|You realize she's not here, right?
|-
!Robbie
|''(Scoffs)'' Yes! ...What?
|-
!Dipper
|She's out camping with her family today. ''(Quietly:)'' And if you listened to her for once you'd know that.
|-
!Robbie
|What was that?!
|-
!Dipper
|I- just said she's not here.
|-
!Robbie
|No, no, no! You want to get into it, huh? Lets get into it, kid! You think I don't know what's been going on, huh? It's obvious you've got a thing for my girlfriend, don't you? Don't you?!
|-
!Dipper
|What? No! C'mon, man!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Sarcastically:)'' Yeah, I'm sure she's just DYING to ask out a 12-year old kid who wears the exact same shorts every day. Hey, here's an idea: ''(Pulls out his cell phone and calls Wendy)'' why don't I call her right now and see if she wants to go out on a date with you?
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! Look-! Don't! You don't have to-!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Mimicking Dipper:) ''Oh! Don't! Please, man! ''(Holds up phone; normal voice:)'' What're you gonna do, huh? What, huh?
|-
!Wendy
|''(On phone:)'' Hello?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Smacks Robbie's cell phone out of his hand, making it hit the ground and break)''
|-
!Robbie
|My phone!
|-
!Dipper
|I-I'll buy you a new one!
|-
!Robbie
|Oh no, you're not getting off that easy! ''(Lifts Dipper up by the collar and prepares to hit him)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Poking head out of window)'' Hey! I know a fight when I see one! Stay right there! ''(Closes window)''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Throws Dipper to the ground)''
|-
!Robbie
|You. Me. [[Circle Park]]. 3 o'clock. ''(Walking away)'' We finish this.
|-
!Stan
|''(Arrives with a bucket of popcorn)'' Aw, he's gone! I was just gonna call the boys over to place a few bets! ''(Chews popcorn)'' The smart money's on Skinny Jeans.
|-
!
|''Cut to living room with Soos, Stan, Mabel, Waddles and Dipper, who is pacing back and forth.''
|-
!Dipper
|What was I thinking?! I can't fight! I've never been in a fight before! Look at these noodle arms! ''(Waves arms)''
|-
!Stan
|Just bonk him over the head! It's nature's snooze button!
|-
!Mabel
|Boys! Why can't you learn to hate each other in secret? Like girls do!
|-
!Stan
|''(Snickers)'' Sure, listen to your sister! Maybe you can share dresses too! ''(Laughs)'' BOOM!
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe he'll just forget about it. Maybe it'll all blow over.
|-
!Soos
|I don't know, Dipper. Teenagers are dangerous. Those hormones turn them into like, killing machines!
|-
!Dipper
|R-Really?
|-
!Soos
|Oh yeah, dude. My cousin [[Reggie]] got in a fight with a teen once. The guy broke like, all his arms, all his legs, and I think, killed him or something, I don't know. Me and Reggie were just talking about it.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Backing up into corner)'' I can't stay here! What if Robbie comes back!? I gotta hide!!
|-
!Stan
|Look, kid. You got yourself a choice here. You can either go face him like a man, or you can hide indoors like a wimp. What'll it be?
|-
!
|''Dipper silently ponders what Stan said. Cut to arcade. Soos is playing an arcade game and Dipper is hiding under it.''
|-
!Soos
|Wimp it is.
|-
!Dipper
|C'mon Soos, Robbie's twice my size. I mean, what will getting myself killed accomplish? I just need to hide here until 3 o'clock passes. ''(Looks at watch; it turns into 11:30)'' Uggggh, this day will never end!
|-
!Soos
|Relax, Dipper. Just try not to think about Robbie.
|-
!Dipper
|Ah! ''(Looks up at dozens of posters for Robbie's band, all with their slogan: "You're dead!")''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mystery Shack, where, on TV, [[Sassica]] berates a teenage girl.''
|-
!Sassica
|Giiirl, why you 'ackin so cray-cray?
|-
!Crowd
|''(Cheers)''
|-
!TV Announcer
|''[[Why You Ackin' So Cray-Cray?]]'' will be back in a moment.
|-
!Mabel
|Ugh, poor Dipper. Hiding from Robbie, unable to face his fears.
|-
!Waddles
|''(Oinks)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Walking into kitchen)'' Fears are for chumps. That's why I don't have any. ''(Tries to reach an item on a shelf)'' Ugh, ugh!
|-
!Mabel 
|You want me to go get a ladder?
|-
!Stan
|We don't have one.
|-
!Mabel
|What?
|-
!Stan
|You know, studies show that keeping a ladder in the house is more dangerous than a loaded gun. That's why I own ten guns, in case some maniac tries to sneak in with a ladder.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Suspiciously:)'' Grunkle Stan, why you ackin' so cray-cray?
|-
!Stan
|YOU'RE the one who's "ackin' cray-cray!" ''(Leaving)'' I gotta go now.
|-
!Mabel
|Why would Grunkle Stan be so weirded out by ladders? Of course! I think he has a secret fear of heights! We'll have to test him to be sure! Or we could leave well enough alone... Nah! 
|-
!
|''Cut to arcade, where Soos is playing [[NORT]]. His avatar falls over.''
|-
!Soos
|Man, I wonder what it would be like to go inside a video game for real! ''(Drills his way into the arcade game itself)'' I should have thought of this years ago! ''(Tries to squeeze in)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Playing "Fight Fighters")'' Stupid Robbie. Such a jerk!
|-
!Game announcer
|Round One! Fight!
|-
!
|''Dipper loses the first round.''
|-
!Game announcer
| K.O! Continue?
|-
!Rumble
| A WINNER NEVER RUNS AWAY FROM A FIGHT!!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' That's easy for you to say, you have more than one life. Ugh, I wish one of these guys would fight Robbie for me. ''(Starts to insert another coin, but drops it and it rolls onto the floor. He bends down to pick it up and notices something written on the machine, and brushes off the dust, revealing the text; Reading message:)'' "To unleash ultimate power?" I do like things that are ultimate. ''(Enters code)'' Back, back, hold, forward, back, forward, down, hold, quarter circle, forward, triple punch! ''(Machine shuts down)'' I guess it didn't work. ''(Screen flares back to life)'' Uhhh Soos?
|-
!Game announcer
|SELECT YOUR CHARACTER!!
|-
!Dipper
|Uhhh... Rumble McSkirmish?
|-
!Rumble
|''(Materializes outside of the game)'' KickkickkickkickKICK!
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! You're real?
|-
!Dipper and Rumble
|HIGH FIVE! ''(High five)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ow! Your pixels are really sharp! Ugh!
|-
!Rumble
|GREETINGS, CHILD-BOY! I AM RUMBLE MCSKIRMISH, FROM THE U.S.A! PUNCH! KICK! PUNCH! KICK!! ''(Kicks Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ow! Cooool!
|-
!Rumble
|''(Spots a change machine) ''CHANGE MACHINE! CHANGE ME INTO A POWERFUL WOLF!! HWAAAAH!!! ''(Smashes change machine)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To himself:)'' With Rumble around, Robbie will be so scared, I won't even need to fight him. I've got the world's greatest fighter to be my bodyguard!
|-
!Rumble
|''(Flashes red)'' I need power ups!
|-
!Dipper
|This is so amazing! I gotta show Soos!'' (Looks around)'' Soos?
|-
!
|''A [[Unnamed red cap man|man]] walks up to NORT machine and screams upon seeing Soos literally inside the game.''
|-
!Soos
|Help, I'm trapped in the game! It was cool in theory but in practice it was really boring.
|-
!Man
|''(Screams and runs away)''
|-
!Soos
|It's not just a game anymore!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, Waddles. It's time to begin. Operation Get Stan Over His Fear of Heights! I came up with that name. ''(Walks over to where Stan is sleeping on the couch; to Stan:)'' HAPPY GREAT UNCLE'S DAY!
|-
!Stan
|''(Stan wakes up and is handed a present by Mabel)'' Huh? Is it Great Uncle's Day?
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha, yeah of course it's not a day I made up.
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens the box and pulls out high heels)'' High heels? You shouldn't have. Seriously, wha- what? What is this?
|-
!Mabel
|What's wrong? Are you saying these heels are TOO high? Do they make you uncomfortable? Hmm?
|-
!Stan
|Maybe.
|-
!Mabel
|Admit it! Admit you have a fear of heights!
|-
!Stan
|''(Adjusting television's antennae)'' What? That's why you bought me these? You should be ashamed of yourself! And on Great Uncle's Day no less. But no, I don't have a "fear of heights."
|-
!TV announcer
|We now return to "[[World's Most Terrifying Skydiving]]!"
|-
!Stan
|Ah! Ah! Turn it off! ''(Trips over the dinosaur skull)'' So I have a fear of heights. Is that really so cray-cray?
|-
!
|''Cut to the kitchen.''
|-
!Rumble
|''(Attacks fly; laughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Checking the refrigerator)'' Well, we don't have any traditional power ups: turkey legs, pizza boxes, or gold rings. How about... half a taco?
|-
!Rumble
|Place it, on the floor.
|-
!
|''Dipper puts the taco on the floor, Rumble looks at it, it disappears and then reappears in his power-ups menu.''
|-
!Dipper
|I wish I could do that!
|-
!Rumble
|Now I must defeat the world's greatest fight-fighters. Take me to the Soviet Union!
|-
!Dipper
|That's gonna be tough... for a number of reasons. But I do know a fighter here in Gravity Falls.
|-
!Rumble
|Maximum Power?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gives Rumble one of Robbie's band posters)'' His name is Robbie V. and he's kinda like my arch enemy.
|-
!Rumble
|Did he kill [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|your father]]?
|-
!Dipper
|Well he's dating the girl I like and he posts a really annoying amount of status updates.
|-
!Rumble
|''(Crumples the poster)'' And then he killed your father!
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, sure. Anyway, I was hoping you could, y'know, scare him off for me so I don't have to fight the guy.
|-
!Rumble
|Hahaha! Your question makes my shoulders bounce! Fire ball! ''(Shoots a [[wikipedia:Street_Fighter#Hadouken|Hadouken]] at the window, does the actions as he says them:) ''Uppercut! Downer-cut! Bowl of PUNCH! ''(Drinks from punch bowl and then smashes it)''
|-
!Dipper
|So you'll protect me from Robbie?
|-
!Rumble
|Challenge accepted! Press start! ''(A start button appears)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Presses it)'' Uh oh, I think I hear my uncle. Stay perfectly still!
|-
!
|''Pans out, showing Dipper standing next to Rumble, who is rocking back and forth in a fighting stance.''
|-
!Dipper
|I said stay still.
|-
!Rumble
|''(Still rocking back and forth)'' This is as still as I can stay!
|-
!
|''Cut to attic.''
|-
!Mabel
|How am I gonna get Grunkle Stan over his fear of heights?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks in with Rumble)'' Hey Mabel. Have you met Rumble yet? He's my new bodyguard.
|-
!Rumble
|The child gave me a taco!
|-
!Mabel
|Wow! He's got a crazy voice! Here, say these words.'' (Writes words on a piece of paper and hands them to Rumble)''
|-
!Rumble
|''(Reading:)'' Effer...vescent! Apple..fritter! RIBOFLAVIN!!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, he's not a toy, he's a fighting machine. I'm gonna get him to defend me from Robbie.
|-
!Mabel
|Isn't that kinda like cheating?
|-
!Dipper
|I guess so. Well, I'll see you after the fight.
|-
!Rumble
|''(Reading:)'' POOP! POOP AND BUTTS!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Rumble out on [[Main Street]].''
|-
!Rumble
|Tell me my opponent's special moves.
|-
!Dipper
|Don't worry. As soon as he sees you, he's gonna wet his pants.
|-
!Rumble
|His wet pants will be no match FOR THIS! ''(Picks up a metal pipe and whips it around)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Where'd that came from?
|-
!Rumble
|I punched an oil drum!
|-
!Dipper
|Trust me, you won't need that. Just give him a good scare.
|-
!Rumble
|Yes... ''(Picks up a sword)'' WITH THIS!!! ''(Swings sword around)''
|-
!Dipper
|This street has really dangerous litter.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Mystery Shack. Stan is drinking [[Pitt Cola]] in the living room.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Creeps up behind his chair)'' HEY GRUNKLE STAN!!
|-
!Stan
|''(Spits his drink out in surprise)''
|-
!Mabel
|How would you like to go take a walk nowhere in particular while wearing a blindfold?
|-
!Stan
|Eh, beats just sittin' around here being old. ''(Gets up, pauses and then starts to sit back down)'' Wait a minute... you're not planning on taking me someplace super high up, are you?
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan! I would never! ''(Puts on scout's honor sweater)'' Scout's honor!
|-
!Stan
|Alright, let's go.
|-
!
|''Stan walks away, and Mabel turns around to reveal the back of the sweater has crossed fingers on it. She chuckles mischievously and pulls her tucked hair out of the sweater so that it's covering the crossed fingers. Cut to Circle Park. Robbie is waiting. Three bells ring. Robbie approaches Dipper.''
|-
!Robbie
|Well, well, well! Look who decided to show up! I thought you chickened out. You ready to settle this like men?
|-
!Dipper
|Look dude, I don't think you want to fight me. Let's just call this thing off before someone gets hurt.
|-
!Robbie
|You scared, huh? Is that it?
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, dude! You asked for it! ''(Snaps his fingers)''
|-
!Rumble
|''(Comes out from the dark and assumes fighting pose)''
|-
!Robbie
|Who's your friend? And why is he... blurry?
|-
!Dipper
|This happens to be the greatest warrior that ever lived!
|-
!Robbie
|Yeah, right! Hey Eye Patch, what did the kid promise you? More tape for your forearms? ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Rumble
|HOW CAN YOU LAUGH, WHEN YOU KILLED THIS BOY'S FATHER?!?!!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Confused)'' Wait, what?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm giving you one last chance, back down, or this guy's gonna go nuts.
|-
!Robbie
|How 'bout YOU back down, kid?
|-
!Dipper
|You asked for it. Rumble? Go!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Laughs; ducks Rumble's punch)'' What the-? ''(Tries to run away, but Rumble picks him up)'' Whoa! Hey! What's happening?
|-
!Dipper
|I didn't wanna have to do this, man, but you gave me no choice. Maybe now, if you-
|-
!Rumble
|HA ''HA! (Slams Robbie to the ground)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Rumble! You can stop! I think Robbie's had enough-
|-
!Rumble
|RUMBLE... ''(Throws Robbie high in the air)'' THROW!
|-
!Dipper
|STOP! I SAID STOP!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Lands on metal bars)'' Hey! What the-? THAT GUY'S CRAZY!
|-
!Rumble
|FIREBALL! ''(Throws a fireball, which hits the bars and Robbie runs off)''
|-
!Dipper
|What the heck was that?! You were only supposed to scare him; you almost killed him!
|-
!Rumble
|I WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE MAN WHO DISHONORED YOU IS DESTROYED!!! ''(Punches Robbie's band poster and runs after him)'' AAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGGGG! ''(Jumps up and punches an electric pole)'' PUNCH!!
|-
!Dipper
|This isn't good. ''(Arrives at [[Barrels & Crates, Incorporated]])'' Something told me this would be his first stop.
|-
!
|''Robbie runs out of the building and starts down the fire escape. Rumble Breaks through the wall with a barrel.''
|-
!Rumble
|AHA!! ''(Throws barrel at Robbie)''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Ducks to avoid the barrel)'' Chill out man! Just chill out!
|-
!Dipper
|Please, Rumble! You gotta stop!
|-
!
|''Rumble throws down barrels at Robbie, which Robbie jumps over, imitating ''
[[wikipedia:Donkey Kong|Donkey Kong]]'', then continues chasing him'')

|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, I kinda sorta brought him to life to be my bodyguard. But now I have to stop him before he kills Robbie!

!Stan
|What's the matter, YOU got a fear of heights, now? Haha! ''(Pauses)'' Uh-oh.
|-
!Robbie
|''(Unhooks his hood from tree branch; to Dipper:)'' What? Who-who-who was that guy?! Why is it that whenever you're around, there's always ghosts or monsters, or whatever?!
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know, man.
|-
!Robbie
|That guy almost broke my neck! You know how mad I am right now?!!
|-
!Dipper
|So I guess you and I have to fight now, huh? Go ahead, man. Do your worse. I just want to get this over with.
|-
!Robbie
|Oh, man! I am so gonna enjoy this! ''(Raises his fist)'' Aren't you gonna run?
|-
!Dipper
|Nope.
|-
!Robbie
|...Are you sure?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Nods)''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Pauses; scoffs)'' It's not even worth it! I play lead guitar so I gotta save my hands.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Walks up to Dipper and Robbie)'' Hey guys! I heard some crazy screaming back here.
|-
!Dipper and Robbie
|Wendy?
|-
!Dipper
|You're back!
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, man. Whoa! What the heck happened here? Freak tornado or something?
|-
!Dipper and Robbie
|Uh, yeah, sure.
|-
!Wendy
|And why are your faces all jacked up? You guys weren't fighting each other, were you? I hate it when guys fight.
|-
!Dipper
|No! Fighting?
|-
!Robbie
|Why would we be fighting? Never!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, we actually fell over trying to stop two other guys from fighting each other.
|-
!Wendy
|Cool! It really makes me happy to see my two boys hanging out. I got some unpacking to do. I'll text you guys later. ''(Kisses Robbie and pats Dipper, then leaves)''
|-
!Dipper
|Did you hear that? She called me one of her two boys!
|-
!Robbie
|She was looking at me, though.
|-
!Dipper
|Look, Robbie, if we're stay at each other's throats, we're both gonna lose Wendy. We need to make a cold war pact.
|-
!Robbie
|Okay. What's that?
|-
!Dipper
|We need to learn to hate each other, in silence.
|-
!Robbie
|You mean like, what girls do?
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, exactly! What girls do.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mystery Shack. Dipper, Robbie, and Wendy are at the cash register.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Brushing her hair)'' So, then I told [[Thompson]], "Hey, save some for the rest of us!"
|-
!Dipper and Robbie
|Ha! Good one, Wendy! That's great!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Drops her hairbrush)'' Aw, man. Just a sec. ''(Bends down to retrieve it)''
|-
!Dipper and Robbie
|''(Growl at each other)''
|-
!Wendy

!Dipper and Robbie
|''(Agreeing with Wendy)''

|-
!Dipper
|I'm Dipper. I have shorts and determination!
|-
!Mabel
|It's a-me! A-Mabel!
|-
!Stan
|I'm slower, but I jump higher.
|-
!Wendy
|Pick me or whatever.

!Dipper
|Y'know, puberty and stuff.

!Mabel
|It doesn't make any sense. Just a second ago you were- WAIT A MINUTE! This is some kinda magicky thing. Isn't it? Was it a wizard or something? There's a wizard in this closet, isn't there? ISN'T THERE?

|-
!Soos
|(''Takes off his hat of and puts on Stan's fez and looks at himself in the mirror'') One day!
|-
!Stan
|(''Picks up phone and grunts'')
|-
!Gideon
|Stanford Pines, listen to me very closely. I have your niece and nephew. Hand over the deed to the Mystery Shack right now, or great harm will befall them! (P''auses'') This is Gideon, by the way.
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha ha! Oh yeah, this is gonna be your worst plot yet. They're fine. I saw them playing in the yard minutes ago. 
|-
!Gideon
|I have them in my possession! You don't believe me? I will text you a photo!
|-
!Stan
|"Text me a photo"? Now you're not even speakin' Spanish!
|-
!Gideon
|But —
|-
!Stan
|(''Hangs up'')
|-
!Gideon
|Hello? Hello? Arrgh! (''Throws phone at the wall and it breaks, nearly hitting Dipper'')
Wait. (''Laughs insanely'') What am I doing? I don't need ransom! I have THIS! (''Holds up flashlight'') I'll shrink Stan and take the Shack for myself! (''Turns to the twins'') You'll be helpless to stop me. And if you step out of line, SMASH! (''Pulls the heads off of the Pines dolls and laughs evilly'')
|-
!Bud Gleeful
|Gideon! The ice cream truck is here!
|-
!Gideon
|Oh! Coming! (''Giggles; puts hamster down next to the twins'') Guard them, [[Cheekums]]. I'm coming! (''Runs off and pants)''
|-
!Dipper
|(''Picks up Q-tip and pokes the hamster with it'')
|-
!Cheekums
|(''Squeaks)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' We've gotta get out of here and save Stan!
|-
!Mabel
|I know! (''Puts Gummy Koala in her sweater's pocket'') I will see you later.
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, how are we going to do this. Gideon's got magic and, like, a zillion inches on us. On the bright side, at least we're finally the same height again.
|-
!Mabel
|Actually...
|-
!Dipper
|(''Finds a ruler and measures them'') You're still taller? Arrgh! How did this happen?
|-
!Mabel
|I guess it's another mystery.
|-
!Dipper
|Just another reason we've gotta get that flashlight back. ''(Looks down at carpet)''
|-
!Mabel
|(''Sitting on Cheekums)'' Cheekums, to freedom! (''Pats Cheekums'') To freedom! (''Pats Cheekums'') Oh, you're just a big old dummy-dum!
|-
!Dipper
|(''Looks at Gideon's hairbrush'') I have a plan.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|(''Slide down a rope made of Gideon's hairs; they hide in a shoe and peek out at Gideon and Bud, who are eating ice cream; the flashlight sits on the table'')
|-
!Gideon
|Clean me! (''Bud wipes Gideon's face with a cloth'') Father, could you give widdle old me a ride to the Mystery Shack?
|-
!Bud Gleeful
|Oh, I'd love to, sugarpot, but I have a heck of a lot of cars to sell, I do! (''Tickles Gideon'') I do!
|-
!Gideon
|(''Laughs'') No, no, (''furiously'') NO, DON'T TICKLE MEEEE! NO! (''Throws ice cream across the room where it hits a wall, just missing Mrs. Gleeful'') NEVER! Never tickle me! What have I told you? What have I told — look at me — what have I told you?!
|-
!Bud
|Ticklin' is no laughing matter.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Pats him)'' There we go.
|-
!Bud
|Do you still need a ride?
|-
!Gideon
|I'll just take the BUS! (''Knocks table over, kicks door open and leaves'')
|-
!Bud
|Precious memories. 
|-
!Mrs. Gleeful
|Just keep vacuuming. Just keep vacuuming...
|-
!Dipper 
|Come on! (''He and Mabel go out the dog door to the parking lot'') We need to get higher.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, especially you, 'cause you're short.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel! up there. (''Points at flying discount dollar, and they climb it to see Gideon and Lazy Susan at a bus stop'')
|-
![[Lazy Susan]]
|What cute little thing are you off to you cute little cutie-face?
|-
!Gideon
|I'm gonna annihilate my archenemy's entire family.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|(''With a worried face'') Oh okay... (''Weakly'') yaaay...
|-
!
|''A bus drives by and Gideon enters.''
|-
!Dipper 
|He's heading to shrink Stan!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh flying discount dollar, if only you could fly us back to the Mystery Shack.
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe it can. (''Pulls out Swiss army knife with scissors, cuts the rope freeing the discount dollar and they start flying away'') 
|-
!Bud 
|(''Sees it and spit take'') My sky high prices!
|-
!Dipper
|Yaaay!
|-
!Mabel
|Wooh hooo!
|-
!Dipper 
|Down there! ''(They push the wings to make the balloon fly lower, and follow the bus along the road)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Yeah!
|-
!Mabel
|To the Mystery Shack!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Yay!
|-
!
|''Scene goes to the Mystery Shack. The balloon has crashed on the totem pole.''
|-
!Dipper
|We're just in time, (''points to the arriving bus that Gideon is on'') but how are we going to stop him? (''woodpecker pecks his head'') Ah shoo ah ha ah!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sees a wire leading to the roof)'' Leave that to Mabel.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Walks toward the Shack while humming)'' I'm comin' for ya, Stanford!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Drops Gummy Koala in his hair)'' I'm sorry, gummy friend.
|-
!Dipper 
|It's for the greater good. 
|-
!Gideon
|Ugh! One of those infernal Gummy Koalas has gotten into my perfect hair. I can't defeat Stan looking like this. (''drops flashlight and walks towards a bath tub to use it as a mirror, takes out the candy from his hair and sprays on hairspray'') Woo! Woowee!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|(''Run towards flashlight and set it up)''
|-
!Mabel
|Quick, get in front and I'll re-grow you.
|-
!Dipper
|Okay. Wait, you're gonna grow us back to equal height right?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! That doesn't matter right now.
|-
!Dipper
|Well if it doesn't matter, why don't you just do it?
|-
!Mabel
|AWWW! Why you acting so weird! Why can't you just except that I'm a little bit taller than you?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, I'm acting weird? You're the one who keeps calling me names and stuff.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, what? You mean like little-
|-
!Dipper
|Don't say it!
|-
!Gideon
|Little Dipper. (''picks up Mabel and Dipper'')
|-
!Gideon
|I dare say you would have defeated me, if it wasn't for your sibling bickering! (''Kicks open the door of the Mystery Shack'') The Shack is mine, Stanford Pines! ''(Holds out flashlight and turns it on)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Noooo!
|-
!
|''Stan's fez falls to floor. Commercial break''
|-
!Gideon
|(''walks towards the fez and lift it up'') Well, well, Stanford it appears I finally got the best of-
|-
!Soos
|''(Is under the fez)'' Oh!
|-
!Gideon
|What?!
|-
!Soos
|(''puts his hat back on'') Alright, something's definitely different here...
|-
!Gideon
|''(Puts Dipper, Mabel, and Soos in a glass jar and shakes them)'' Tell me where Stan is!
|-
!Soos
|Never! you'll never find Stan: on the second door to the left down the hall. Wait, why did I say that?
|-
!Gideon
|(''Puts jar in his suit jacket'') Oh Stanford, I'm coming for ya!
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, and Soos
|(''Try to break out of the jar'')
|-
!Mabel
|(''Sees Gideon's picture on his school ID and sticks out tongue and makes rasberry'')
|-
!Soos
|I guess I kinda Soosed that one up, didn't I?
|-
!Dipper
|It's not your fault, Soos, I'm the guy who put together that shrinking device. ''(To Mabel:)'' I guess it's just you kept teasing me Mabel, like all day. What was that all about?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gives him the notebook which keeps track of wins and losses)'' I guess it's that, you're like better than me at like everything, and you always rub it in my face... Chess, checkers, ping pong. I guess I finally felt like I was winning at something for once.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh man, now I feel like a big jerk.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't you mean a ''little'' jerk?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
|-
!Dipper
|Alright I walked into that one. Are we cool?
|-
!Mabel
|We're cool. (G''ives fist bump'')
|-
!Soos
|Am I cool? (H''olds out hand'')
|-
!Mabel
|You're cool, Soos. (''Fist bump'')
|-
!Soos
|Yes!
|-
!Gideon
|('' In the mirror room, sees multiple Stans on the mirrors'') Stanford!
|-
!Stan
|Oh hi, Gideon, I've been looking for someone to try out my new mirror maze, then again, you're an idiot. That's the end of the sentence. (''leaves'')
|-
!Gideon
|(''Puts flashlight in other suit pocket'') You come back here!
|-
!Stan
|Try and find me, twerp! Ha, ha ha!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Soos stacked up in the jar.''
|-
!Mabel
|(''On top, opens jar'')
|-
!Dipper
|Let's get back that flashlight before Gideon gets Stan.
|-
!
|''Dipper, Mabel, and Soos peek out of Gideon's pocket''
|-
!Dipper
|There it is! (''Points to the flashlight; they climb to Gideon's back'')
|-
!Mabel
|Woah! His hair's so shiny! (''approaches Gideon's hair'')
|-
!Dipper
|(''Pulls back Mabel'') No! Don't look directly at it!
|-
!Soos
|(''Jumps on Gideon's neck'') His neck is really squishy! Hey look, I'm making fat angels.
|-
!Gideon
|Ew! Termites! (''Hits back of neck, Soos falls off'')
|-
!Soos
|(''Falling'') Tell my storyyyyy! (''Lands on carpet'') Hey, there you are! (''picks up chip'') Thought you could get away from me, eh corn chip? (''Takes a bite out of corn chip'')
|-
!
|''Cut to Gideon looking for Stan in the mirror maze''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Sees one of Stan's reflections)'' AH! (''Pulls out flashlight, shoots a beam, but it bounces around the mirrors and shrinks a moose head on the wall'')
|-
!Stan
|Ha, ha, ha, ha!
|-
!Gideon
|NOW! (''Throws flashlight and breaks mirror'')
|-
!Stan
|Hey! Watch the merchandise!
|-
!Gideon
|(''Breaks more mirrors)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks up to him)'' You little troll! Those mirrors cost me ten, I mean twenty-five, five-hundred. Five-hundred dollars each, and you're paying for all of 'em!
|-
!Gideon
|Oh contraire. It will be you who pays!
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan is doomed!
|-
!Dipper
|Not completely doomed! To his armpit!
|-
!Mabel
|Uh uh.
|-
!Dipper
|(''Pushes Mabel in Gideon's clothing'') Just! Uh! Come on!
|-
!Stan
|Woah! What is that thing?!
|-
!Gideon
|Finally after all these years, after every humiliation! Your business, your family, everything will finally be mine! You have no one to protect you now! (''corners Stan to wall'') Prepare for the wrath of Gideon Glee- Gideon glee- oh oh oh ah oh oh ah (''falls to the ground and laughs uncontrollably'')
|-
!Stan
|Eh. I don't even know how to respond to this.
|-
!Gideon
|(''Laughing uncontrollably; Dipper and Mabel are tickling him'') Uh ey ey ey! No! No! stop it! Ha, ha, ha!
|-
!Stan
|Look um, kid. I think this rivalry thing is getting to you. Ha, I understand. I mean, I'm a formidable foe, what can I say.
|-
!Gideon
|No! (''Foam starts to come out of his mouth'')
|-
!Stan
|Hey now, come on, you'll get me one of these days. Maybe, you know, run your evil plan by some friends next time. Workshop it, but first get your issues in order there.
|-
!Gideon
|(''Still laughing uncontrollably'') Ha! ehh, Ha!
|-
!Stan
|(''Looks around then kicks Gideon across the floor'') Up over the carpet, there we go, around the end table, and out the door. (''Kicks him out the door'')
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|(''While running on top of a rolling Gideon) ''Ah, ah, ah, whoa! ''(Jump off Gideon'')
|-
!Gideon
|(''Pats himself looking for flashlight'') My light!
|-
!Stan
|''(Sarcastically:)'' You're the light of my life too, pal. (''Closes door'') Whoa, freak show.
|-
!Dipper
|(''Sets up flashlight'') After you.
|-
!Mabel
|It's okay, you can go first if you want to. Woah! (''Grows to normal size'')
|-
!Mabel
|(''Re-grows Dipper with flash light and measures height'') Hey, you let me keep my extra millimeter!
|-
!Dipper
|You earned it.
|-
!Mabel
|Awww! Thanks! Little brothe-!
|-
!Dipper
|Stop it.
|-
!Mabel
|Well I guess we should destroy this thing. You know, so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands and junk.
|-
!Dipper
|Seems like the smart thing to do. (''Gives Mabel the crystal'')
|-
!Mabel
|(''Smashes crystal with her foot'') Die, die!
|-
!Soos
|There you dudes are! (''Standing in front of some glass that he has arranged to spell "HELP SOOS"'') I've been trying to get your attention.

|-
!Gideon
|(''Flips chair over madly'') Nooo! It's not just about revenge. I want that shack, the physical. Buildin'.
|-
!Bud
|But why?
|-
!Gideon
|Because it holds a secret you couldn't possibly imagine. (''Maniacal laughter'')
|-
!Bud
|Sweetie, you want some ice cream? 
|-
!Gideon
|Did you pick out all the nuts?
|-
!Bud

![[Stan Pines]]
|Here we are, the [[Summerween Superstore]]!
|-
![[Dipper Pines]]
|Wait, Summer-what?
|-
!Stan
|[[Summerween (event)|Summerween]]! ''(Pulls out a calendar)'' The people of this town love Halloween so much, they celebrate it twice a year. And wouldn't you know it, it's today!
|-
!Dipper
|Do you always carry that calendar in your pocket?
|-
!Stan
|''(Pauses)'' Yes.
|-
![[Mabel Pines]]
|Summerween? Something about this feels unnatural.
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|There's free candy!
|-
!
|''Cut to inside the store.''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|TO THE COSTUME AISLE!
|-
!Soos
|''(Presses [[Cackling skulls|a cackling skull]])''
|-
!Skull
|I'd lend you a hand... but I don't seem to have any! ''(Cackles)''
|-
!Soos
|Haha, this guy tells it like it is.
|-
![[Summerween Superstore worker|Worker]]
|Sir, could you ''please'' stop pushing that?
|-
!Soos
|Ma'am, make these heads less hilarious, and you got yourself a deal. ''(Presses skull)''

!Skull
|''(Cackles)''
|-
!Store worker
|Ugh...
|-
!Stan
|''(Picks up a big barrel of fake blood)'' Ha ha! When the children come to ''my'' door tonight, they're gonna run away screaming from Stan Pines, Master of Fright! ''(Turns, faces a baby)'' Boo.
|-
!
|''The baby cries as Stan laughs. Soos continues pressing the skulls and Dipper and Mabel knock over a pile of [[Jack-o'-melons|jack o' melons]].''
|-
!Stan
|''(Holding leaking container of fake blood)'' Uh-oh. Think this one's leaking!
|-
!Store worker
|''(On walkie talkie)'' Have the police come and eject the Pines family from the store.
|-
!Stan
|NOT TODAY! ''(Tosses [[smoke bomb]])''
|-
!Store worker
|MY EYES!
|-
!Pines and Soos
|''(Runs out with some Summerween stuff)??''

!Dipper
|We're gonna have the best costumes, get the most candy...
|-
!Mabel
|And have the biggest stomachaches ever!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah!
|-
!Mabel
|Haha, yeah!
|-
!Soos
|''(Dressed as a superhero)'' Dude, I've never seen you guys so pumped.
|-
!Mabel
|Well, back at home, me and Dipper were kind of the kings of trick-or-treating. ''(Shows a memory book of them in costumes)'' Twins in costumes, the people eat it up.
|-
!Soos
|Well, you dudes better be careful out there. It's a night of ghouls and goblins. Not to mention... ''(turns off lights and shines flashlight in face)'' the [[Summerween Trickster]]! ''(Dramatic music plays)''
|-
!Mabel
|The Summer-what-what?
|-
!Soos
|The Trickster goes door to door, so the legend goes, eating children who lack the Summerween spirit.
|-
!Dipper
|Well, you don't have to worry about us. ''(Eats piece of candy)'' We've got spirit to go around. ''(Coughs, lights turn back on)'' Ugh! What is this stuff? I've never even heard of these brands. ''(Shows each candy as he names them)'' Sand Pop? Gummy chairs? Mr. Adequate-Bar?
|-
!Mabel
|This is all cheap-o [[loser candy]]!
|-
!Soos
|Quiet your discontent, children, lest the Trickster overhear.
|-
!Dipper
|Your cape is caught in your fly, Soos.

!Wendy
|I left my jacket here. Again.

!Robbie
|What's with the candy? You're goin' trick-or-treating or something?
|-
!Dipper
|Well actually I, uh —
|-
!Wendy
|Shut up, Robbie, of course he's not going trick-or-treating.
|-
!Dipper
|No! Uh, yeah. ''(Hides the scrapbook)'' Trick-or-treating is for babies. ''(Laughs nervously)'' I guess.
|-
!Wendy
|You should come to this party with us. [[Tambry|Tambry's]] parents are out of town, and it's gonna be OFF THE CHAIN.
|-
!Robbie
|Not surprised ''you'' didn't hear about it. ''(Hands Dipper a flyer)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey guys, wait! Maybe I'll see you at the party.
|-
!Robbie
|If you're not too busy playing dress up.
|-
!Wendy

|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, these are my best friends, [[Candy Chiu|Candy]] and [[Grenda]].
|-
!Candy Chiu
|I am so sweet I could eat myself.
|-
!Grenda
|Hello, Mr. Pines!
|-
!Stan
|''(Is dressed as a vampire)'' You got a cold, honey? Something wrong with your voice there?
|-
!Grenda
|What do you mean? Why would you say that?
|-
!Stan
|''(Waves his cape and walks away)''
|-
!Candy
|Is [[Waddles]] coming with us?
|-
!Mabel
|I wish he could, but he has some ''very important meetings to attend!''
|-
!Waddles
|''(Walks in with a suit attacked to his chest. He runs up to Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|File these documents under 'I', for "I have a curly tail!"
|-
!Grenda
|''(Grenda and Candy laughing)'' What about your brother?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh man guys, just ''wait'' until you see Dipper's costume! It's amazing! Here he comes now!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks down the stairs dressed normally)''
|-
!Candy
|That is a very good Dipper costume.
|-
!Mabel
|What the hey-hey bro-bro, where's your costume?
|-
!Dipper
|Look, I can't go trick-or-treating. I'm... uh, ''really'' sick. ''(Fake coughs)'' Must have been that bad candy. ''(Falls on floor)'' Go on without me.
|-
!Mabel
|Fight through it, man! Where's your Summerween spirit?
|-
!
|''Someone knocks on the door. Dipper opens it.''
|-
!Trickster
|Trick-or-treat.
|-
!Dipper
|Dude, really? You're a little old for this, man. Sorry.
|-
!Trickster
|But wait, I ''— (Door slams)''
|-
!Mabel
|Why'd you close the door?
|-
!Dipper
|I told you, Mabel, I'm just not feeling it tonight. ''(Fake coughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|I think a little trick-or-treating will make you feel better.
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not trick-or-treating!
|-
!
|''Knocking on door again.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Opens door)'' Look man, just go to another house! ''(Slams door)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! Where's your Summerween hospitality?
|-
!
|''Knocking on door.''
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not getting that.
|-
!Mabel
|Well I am! ''(Opens door)'' I apologize for my brother, he came down with a case of the grumpy-grumps.
|-
!Trickster
|SILENCE! You have insulted me! For this you must pay... with your LIVES. 
|-
!Mabel
|Aww, what a cute little mask! You're a funny guy, aren't you?

!Dipper, Mabel, Candy and Grenda
|''(Scream)''
|-
!Grenda
|Gorney!
|-
!Trickster
|There's only one way for you to avoid his fate. ''(Pokes Candy on the head, Candy clutches Dipper in fright)'' I need a treat. If you can collect 500 pieces of candy, and bring it to me before the last jack-o-melon goes out... ''(Blows out jack-o-melon)'' I will let you live.
|-
!Dipper
|Five hundred treats in one night? That's impossible!
|-
!Trickster
|The choice is yours, children. You must trick-or-treat... Or DIE. Bwahahaha. ''(Crawls across the Shack's roof and out of sight)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh my gosh Mabel, do you realize what this means?
|-
!Mabel
|I do. It means you have to come trick-or-treating! Yay! ''(Shakes Dipper) ''
|-
!Candy
|Who was that guy?
|-
!Mabel
|It's the legend Soos told us about. It's true!
|-
!Grenda
|''(Shaking Dipper)'' What do we do what do we DO!
|-
!Soos
|What's goin' on out here, dudes? I heard a ruckus. Hehe. That's a funny word. Ruckus.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, a monster is making us trick-or-treat or else he's gonna eat us!
|-
!Candy
|I got a picture! ''(Shows Soos a picture she took on her phone; the picture has a pink and fluffy outline, stickers, and a Korean word.''
|-
!Soos
|The Summerween Trickster! Oh man, dude, you guys are in crazy bonkers trouble.
|-
!Dipper
|How are we gonna get that much candy in one night? There's no way!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Clapping)'' Listen up, people. Now some might say that being cursed by a blood-thirsty holiday monster is a bad thing.
|-
!Grenda
|I wet myself.
|-
!Mabel
|But that monster messed with the wrong crew. With Candy's spirit, Grenda's strength, Dipper's brains, and... Soos here, we'll get 500 pieces of candy and have fun doing it too, even if it takes all night!
|-
!Soos, Candy and Grenda
|''(Cheer)''
|-
!Mabel
|To the streets!
|-
!Dipper
|All night? But-but I'm sick, remember?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, what's worse: getting eaten by a horrifying monster, or coming trick-or-treating with us?
|-
!Dipper
|Well..
|-
!Mabel
|Come on! ''(Grabs Dipper by the arms)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Putting in fake fangs)'' Ah, Summerween. Those kids aren't gonna know what hit 'em! ''(Looks through the window and laughs evilly)''
|-
!Kids
|''(Kids ring doorbell)'' Trick-or-treat.
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens door)'' What can I do for y — uh, ugh. Oh no! No! Augahhh! ''(Face melts off, revealing a skull; kids scream and run away; Stan reveals the skull was actually a mask)'' Ah haha! Huh? ''(Notices that two kids haven't left)''
|-
![[Soldier Kid]]
|Can we have candy now?
|-
!Stan
|What's the matter with you kids? That was the scariest thing you've ever seen, right?
|-
!
|''Kids look at each other and motion a "so-so" with their hands.''
|-
!Stan
|Well have you seen ''this''! Ah! ''(Pulls hotdog chain from costume)'' Guts! Real, very real guts!
|-
![[Mummy Kid]]
|Uh, we've been watching horror movies since we were like, two years old.
|-
!Soldier Kid
|Yeah, we're not scared.
|-
!Stan
|Oh, you will be. ''(Covers face with cape menacingly)'' You ''will'' be.
|-
!
|''View of watertower with bats flying by. Trick-or-treaters seen from above.''
|-
![[Manly Dan]]
|''(He and his [[Corduroy brothers|sons]] are dressed as vikings)'' For glory, my children, CHARGE! ''(They smash through door with a battering ram. People inside scream)''
|-
![[Sheriff Blubs]]
|''(Dressed as Durland)'' You make a great me.
|-
![[Deputy Durland]]
|''(Dressed as Blubs)'' No, you make a great me.
|-
!Blubs
|No you do. ''(Durland giggles)''
|-
!Dipper
|I don't understand why we can't just buy our candy and be done with it.
|-
!Mabel
|That sorta takes the fun out of trick-or-treat-or-die.
|-
!Dipper 
|I'm trying to take the DIE out of trick-or-treat-or-die.
|-
!
|''Trick-or-treaters rings door bell. [[Lazy Susan]] answers it.''
|-
!Kids
|Trick-or-treat.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Well aren't you just the cutest! And is everyone in costume? ''(Gives the kids candy)'' Good. Wonderful.
|-
!Kids
|Happy Summerween!
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Candy, Grenda and Soos
|Trick-or-treat!
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Is everyone in costume? ''(Looks at Grenda)'' Chimney sweep, ''(looks at Soos)'' elephant man, ''(looks at Candy)'' squeegee, ''(looks at Mabel) ''ant farm! ''(Looks at Dipper)'' Oh and what are you supposed to be?
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, actually, I'm not dressed up as anything. We're, we're kinda in a hurry, here.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Oh. I see. ''(Gives everyone except Dipper one piece of candy)'' Enjoy!
|-
!Grenda
|One piece of black licorice?
|-
!Candy
|Circus peanut! This is loser candy.
|-
!Dipper
|Four pieces of candy?! This is gonna take forever!
|-
!Mabel
|We've gotta up our game, Dipper. You gotta put on your costume.
|-
!Dipper
|I told you, I'm not up to it, Mabel! ''(Fake coughs)''
|-
!Trickster
|Oh, really? ''(Climbs down onto Soos, picks up a piece of candy out of Soos' bag)'' I've seen better. ''(Grabs a jack-o-melon)'' Tick tock. ''(Blows candle out and jumps behind a house)''
|-
!Mabel
|So what was that about being too sick to wear a costume?
|-
!
|''Dipper sighs and kicks a rock. Cut to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Soldier and Mummy Kids
|We want candy! We want candy!
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens door wearing normal clothes)'' Alright, you got me, kids. You guys win. I guess I'm not that scary, you know, you've-you've- Oh! No! Ughh!'' (Screams as Waddles comes out of his shirt)'' Why?! Why is there a pig jumping out of my chest?!
|-
!
|''Kids look at each other.''
|-
!Mummy Kid
|Candy.
|-
!Soldier Kid
|Can-dy!
|-
!
|''Stan stands there, Waddles falls out of his shirt onto the porch and walks away''
|-
!Stan
|What scares you two freaks?
|-
!Soldier Kid
|''(Grins at each Mummy Kid)'' Here, watch this. ''(Holds up a smart phone with a video)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Watching video)'' What, what is this? Some kinda- some kinda kitten or- ''(monster face appears on the video screaming)'' Ahhhh!! Ah! Ah! ''(Runs inside, kids laughing. Stan looks at the mirror.)'' What happened to you, Stan Pines? What happened?
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|Introducing, for the first time in public... ''(Dipper walks out in his costume, a jar of peanut butter)'' TADAH! Peanut Butter and Jelly!
|-
!Soos, Candy and Grenda
|Awwwww!
|-
!Candy
|''(Takes out her phone)'' I will make you internet famous. ''(Takes picture)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! Erase that! Let's just get this over with, okay?
|-
!All
|Over with! Over with!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Rings doorbell)'' Do you really think this will make a difference?
|-
![[Bats Biker|Biker]]
|''(Opens the door, grunting)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Start dancing)'' Hat a ta tah, Tah tah ta... TWIIIIINS!
|-
!
|''Biker tears up and dumps the entire candy bowl in their bag. Mabel and Dipper smile. Montage of trick-or-treating plays.''
|-
!Dipper
|Let's get that candy, guys!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Counting candy)'' 34, 35...
|-
!Candy
|''(Climbs into the wheelbarrow)'' 36. You see? Because —
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, I get it. ''(More trick-or-treating)'' 22, 23, 24. A hundred and twenty-four!
|-
!
|''People start blowing out jack-o-melons.''
|-
!Dipper
|C'mon, c'mon!
|-
!
|''More doorbell ringing.''
|-
![[Toby Determined]]
|Hello.
|-
!All except Toby
|''(Scream)''
|-
!Mabel
|What a horrible mask!
|-
!Toby
|That's just my face. ''This'' is a mask. ''(Puts on monster mask)'' Roar!
|-
!All except Toby
|Oh, yeah. That's actually better.
|-
!Toby
|''(Sighs)''
|-
!
|''More doorbell ringing.''
|-
!Mabel
|498, 499. We did it! ''(Group cheers)'' All we need is one more piece of candy.
|-
!Dipper
|And it's only 8:30. Perfect timing!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hugs Dipper)'' Mwah! And your cough went away too!
|-
!Soos
|Dude, I'm gonna go around and grab the truck. Soos, away! ''(Runs off)''
|-
!Mabel
|Last one to the last house is a pair of wax lips! ''(Mabel and Candy giggle and run off)''
|-
!Grenda
|Not me! Nooo! ''(Runs after them)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To himself:)'' The perfect time to go to Wendy's party, and no one needs to know I was trick-or-treating.
|-
!
|''Robbie's van pulls up. Dipper panics and quickly takes his costume off and hides it and the wheelbarrow full of candy in the bushes.''
|-
!Wendy
|Hey Dipper!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh hey, Wendy. What's up? ''(Nudges part of his costume into the bush)''
|-
!Wendy
|Are you comin' to the party?
|-
!Robbie
|What are you doing out here?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, um. Haha, I'm on my way. I like watching the trick-or-treaters. Reminds me of when I was a kid. ''(Wipes nose)''
|-
!Wendy
|Ok, then. You're coming, right?
|-
!Dipper
|Definitely, definitely.
|-
!Wendy
|Cool. See you there. ''(Van speeds off)''
|-
!Dipper
|Later, guys.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Behind him)'' You're going to a party?
|-
!Dipper
|Well, hey, I —
|-
!Mabel
|''(Throws the last piece of candy at him)'' That's why you were acting so weird and trying to hurry us! You're not sick at all! So if it wasn't for this crazy monster, you were gonna ditch me! On our favorite holiday! 
|-
!Candy and Grenda
|Ooohh.
|-
!Mabel
|What happened to the Dipper who used to love Halloween?! ''(Looks around)'' And where's all the candy?!
|-
!Dipper
|Relax, relax. I left it right here. Behind this bush. ''(Pushes the bush aside and looks over)'' Oh no.
|-
!
|''The wheelbarrow full of candy has fallen into a creek gorge and most of the candy is floating downstream.''
|-
!Mabel
|What did you do!?
|-
!Dipper
|Well, I-pch I-!
|-
!Grenda
|Uh, guys? ''(As a jack-o-melon goes out)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(As jack-o-melons in front of all the houses go out)'' Oh no! All the jack-o-melons are out!
|-
!Dipper
|Look! ''(Points down the road where the last jack-o-melon is still lit)''
|-
![[Old Man McGucket]]
|''(About to blow it out)'' Ehehe! Good night! ''(Inhales)''
|-
!All except McGucket
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Mabel
|Stop!
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|What?
|-
!All except McGucket
|Nonononnonoo. Don't don't don't!
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|Eh? What's happening?
|-
!Dipper
|Just don't blow out that candle!
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|''(Pulls out a horn to his ear)'' What?
|-
!Dipper
|Don't blow out that candle!
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|''(Beat)'' I'm Old Man McGucket! ''(Inhales)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait!
|-
!Grenda
|''(Rams into McGucket and grabs Jack-o-melon)'' Sorry.
|-
!McGucket
|Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. ''(Climbs over a pile of cars)''
|-
!Dipper
|Phew, that was close. ''(Group sighs; candle goes out)''
|-
!Mabel
|Uh oh.
|-
!Trickster
|''(Walks up)'' Knock knock.
|-
!
|''Grenda drops the jack-o-melon, commercial break.''
|-
!Trickster
|So children. Where's my candy?
|-
!Dipper
|I swear, we had all 500 pieces. Look, it's down there somewhere. We can still get it. ''(Group nods)''
|-
!Trickster
|I'm afraid it's too late! That was your last chance. 
|-
!Dipper
|''(Throws candy at Trickster, but he absorbs it)'' Go, go, go, go!
|-
!
|''Group runs around Trickster, who follows them. Candy screams as it grabs her. Mabel trips and is grabbed by the Trickster.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ahhh!! Dipper!!!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel! ''(Is grabbed by Trickster)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Crashes into the Trickster with his truck, causing it to explode; the kids go flying)''
|-
!Grenda
|We're alive! Yeah!
|-
!Soos
|''(Stops truck)'' Woah.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Soos!
|-
!Soos
|That wasn't like, a regular pedestrian, was it?
|-
!Mabel
|It was the monster!
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks, Soos. Phew. I'm just glad it's over, right? ''(Mabel glares at him and walks away)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Once everyone is in the car)'' Did everyone remember to put on their seatbelts?
|-
!Everyone except Mabel
|Yes.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Nods)''
|-
!Soos
|Let's go! ''(Truck drives off)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Rubs her bruised elbow)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, are you okay? ''(Mabel turns away)'' There's probably some bandages back at the Shack.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looking outside)'' Uh, guys? ''(Trickster reforms and growls, jumping onto the back of the truck; group screams and the truck swerves; the Trickster falls off and hits a telephone pole)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pulling on Soos' cape)'' Breaks! Breaks! Breaks! ''(Truck crashes into the Summerween Superstore)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Coughs and gasps after she sees the monster)''
|-
!Dipper
|We have to hide!'' (Group runs off)''
|-
!Trickster
|''(Growls and tears off the truck's door)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(He, Mabel, Candy and Grenda are hiding in the shelves)'' It's blocking the only exit. Everyone, stay quiet!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, so ''now'' you're worried about the monster. I thought all you cared about was Wendy.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, you know that's not true. I just felt like I was getting a little to old to go trick-or-treating.
|-
!Mabel
|That's exactly why we need to go trick-or-treating, Dipper! We're getting older, there's not that many Halloweens left! I guess I didn't realize it was already our last one.
|-
!Trickster
|''(Roars)''
|-
!Candy
|We have to escape.
|-
!Grenda
|What if it sees us?
|-
!Soos
|''(Hiding in the costume rack)'' If only there was something we could use to cover our bodies and faces with. You know, like a disguise of some kind. 
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel look at each other. Cut to the shelves where the group is hiding from the trickster in costumes. They are heading towards the exit.''
|-
!Dipper
|This way! Almost there! ''(Turns around) ''Soos!
|-
!Soos
|''(Standing in front of the cackling heads)''
|-
!Dipper
|Stop!
|-
!Mabel
|Soos, don't you dare!
|-
!Soos
|Sorry dude, today's been way too stressful. I need some levity. ''(Presses the skull, nothing happens)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh thank goodness. It was out of batteries. ''(Turns around)'' Soos, no!
|-
!Soos
|''(Struggling to open a package of [[Bat-eries]]. He puts them in and presses the head)''
|-
!Skull
|No matter the score, I'm always a-head! Nyaha nyaha.
|-
!Soos
|Hahaha! ''(Slaps his leg)'' This cackling head's the voice of a generation! ''(Trickster comes up behind him and opens its mouth; Soos presses the head again; the monster eats Soos)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey monster! ''(Group pulls out toy weapons and starts attacking the Trickster)''
|-
!Grenda
|''(Chops off one of the Trickster's arm)'' Salt water taffy? Gross!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Hacks at a leg)'' What are you—? ''(Tastes a piece)'' Wait, it is.
|-
!Trickster
|You really haven't figured it out yet? ''(Picks the kids up)'' Don't you recognize me? Look at my face! Look closely. ''(Pulls the mask off)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Scream)''
|-
!Mabel
|Loser candy!
|-
!Trickster
|That's right! Did you ever stop and think about the candy at the bottom of the bag that no one likes? Every year the children of Gravity Falls throw away all of the 'REJECTED' candy into the dump. So I seek revenge; revenge on the picky children who cast me aside. I'm made of every tossed piece of black licorice, every discarded bar of old chocolate with like that white, powder stuff on it. You know that stuff!
|-
!Mabel
|I hate that stuff!
|-
!Trickster
|No one would eat me. But now, I'm going to eat you. ''(Hears something)'' What is that? ''(Screams)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Rips through Trickster's chest, screaming)'' 'Sup, bro?
|-
!
|''Trickster falls to the ground vomiting jelly beans.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Eating the Trickster)'' Dudes, you want some of this?
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Candy, and Grenda
|''(Shake their heads)''
|-
!Trickster
|Wait, you actually think I taste good?
|-
!Soos
|Uh, sure! You know.
|-
!Trickster
|All I've ever wanted is for someone to say that I was... good. ''(Cries candy corn)'' I'm so happy!
|-
!Soos
|Crying makes it a little weird, but, ''(takes another bite)'' guess I'm still eating.
|-
!Gorny
|''(Breaks through Trickster's chest)''
|-
!Soos
|'Sup, Gorny?
|-
!Gorny
|I've been twaumatized!
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Mummy kid
|Now what?
|-
!Soldier kid
|Let's just get our candy already! ''(Goes inside)'' Old dude? Old dude? ''(Goes up to bathroom)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Turns the water on, sighs)'' Wash off the shame, Stan. Wash off the shame.
|-
!Soldier kid
|''(Comes into the bathroom)'' Ha! He thought he could scare us.
|-
!
|''The kids watch Stan pulling off the towel.''
|-
!Stan
|Eh? What's that?
|-
!Kids
|AAAAAAAA! ''(Run away)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Still wearing his underwear)'' Ahahaha! Still got it!
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Soos, Candy, and Grenda
|(C''ome inside)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, Stan!
|-
!Mabel
|Hi, Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Soos, Candy, and Grenda
|Hello, Mr. Pines!
|-
!Stan
|How's it hangin'.
|-
!Wendy
|Hey Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy!
|-
!Wendy
|I didn't see you at the party. Where were you?
|-
!Dipper
|Uh.. I-uh.. I was trick-o-treating. With my sister. ''(Puts his arm around Mabel's shoulder)''
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah.
|-
!Wendy
|The party was lame anyway. Robbie ate a lollipop stick-first and had to go home sick.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Tries not to laugh)''
|-
!Mabel
|Aw, man. We went to every single house, and we didn't even get to eat any candy!
|-
!Stan
|Candy? How's that for candy? ''(Holds up the kid's bags)''
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel grin at each other. Cut to the TV.''
|-
!Announcer
|And now back to the fear guide from Terror Town Street.

!Woman
|''(On TV, screams at alien)''
|-
!Alien
|''(On TV:)'' NYNG NYNG NYNG.
|-
!
|''Everyone is watching TV, eating the candies. Dipper comes to Mabel and attaches a bandage on Mabel's sore arm. Waddles munches the candy in his bowl.''
|-
!Stan
|You know, kids? I've been thinkin'. At the end of the day, Summerween isn't about candy or costumes. Or even scaring people. It's a day when the whole family can get together at one place and celebrate what really matters: PURE EVIL! HAHAHAHAHA!
|-
!
|''(Everyone laughs maniacally and then stops abruptly. There is a pause.)''
|-
!Soos
|I ate a man alive tonight.
|-
!
|''Everyone stares at Soos.''
|-
!
|''Ending credit. Mabel, Grenda and Candy are taking pictures of Waddles with his business man outfit. Then the song "[[9 to 5]]" plays, as the screen shows some meme styled pictures of Waddles. Ends with the cracking skull's voice.''

|Mr. Pines! We got [[tourists]] at 9 o'clock! A whole busload of 'em!
|-
!
|''A bus pulls up and tourists start to get out.''
|-
!Stan
|Hot tamales, it's a jackpot! Soos! Make some new attractions!

|Higher! Bleed 'em dry!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Puts another 0 making it $200)''
|-
!Dipper
|Eesh, Grunkle Stan. It's like when you see tourists, all you see are wallets with legs.
|-
!Stan
|That's not true. ''(Looks out the window and sees a family as wallets with legs)''
|-
!Wallet Boy
|Thanks for taking me to the [[Mystery Shack]], daddy!
|-
!Wallet Dad
|Ha ha! Now don't spend yourself all in one place.

|-
!Stan
|Ladies and gentle-tourists! Looking around my Mystery Shack, you will see many wondrous roadside attractions. Be amazed at the only known photo of a horse riding another horse! ''(Points to a picture of a horse riding another horse, and many tourists take pictures and mutter, interested)'' That's-That's pretty good!'' (Tourists take pictures)'' Be astounded at the horrible, pre-teen wolf boy! ''(Pulls a curtain revealing Dipper with hair glued to his legs and fake wolf ears and teeth) ''Oh! Oh, look at him! All that hair! His body's changing, ah!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes off his fake wolf teeth) ''Grunkle Stan, this is demeaning.
|-
!Stan
|What? I don't know "de meaning" of that word! ''(He and the tourists laugh at his joke.)'' If you throw money at him, he dances.
|-
!
|''The tourists cheer and begin to throw money at Dipper, and he makes an attempt to dance. Stan catches money with a jar.''
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha ha! Ooh! Thank you!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel selling bumper stickers in the gift shop.''
|-
!Mabel
|Behold! Mystery Shack bumper stickers! You can stick 'em on your bumper, or over your husband's mouth. Am I right, ladies? She knows what I'm talking about!
|-
![[Unnamed pointed nosed woman|Woman]]
|Oh! You are bad! How much?
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, it's on the house. That's the Mabel difference! Thanks for visiting!
|-
!Stan
|What!? ''(Appears behind a cardboard cutout of himself)'' What the heck do you think you're doing?
|-
!Mabel
|Business! Ching ching ching! ''(Presses buttons on the cash register)''
|-
!Stan
|Listen, kid. You don't make money by giving stuff away. You're off of register duty!
|-
!Mabel
|But, but-
|-
!Stan
|No buts except for yours out the door. Now shut your yap and get to work!
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, whatever happened to "please" and "thank you"? Hmm? Oh wait. Here they are! ''(Takes out a bag of stickers and puts two stickers that say "Please" and "Thank you" on Stan's face")'' Wop wop! ''(Chuckles)''
|-
!Stan
|Ugh. "Please" never made me any money, kid. (''Puts the "Please" sticker on the back of the cash register'') In fact, just saying the word is giving me a burning sensation.
|-
!
|''Stan slaps the "Thank you" sticker on Soos' back as he sweeps by. Soon after that, Dipper comes in.''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, why do I have to wear this wolf costume? I think I'm getting hookworm.
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs)'' Yep. Gluing dog hair to your body will do that.
|-
!Dipper
|You've got all these dumb, fake exhibits in the Shack. Meanwhile, I've seen actual, amazing things in the forest every day! What if you hunted down a real attraction instead of lying to people for a living?
|-
!Mabel
|And you should be nicer to your employees, too!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah! ''(High fives Mabel)''
|-
!Stan
|Look, you guys got a problem with how I run the Shack, take it up with the complaints department. (''holds up a trash can.) ''Zing!
|-
!Mabel
|I am going to write them such a letter! ''(Starts writing a letter, covering what she's writing with her arm.)''

!
|''Cuts to Mabel, Dipper, Wendy, and Soos painting the Mystery Shack sign a glittery pink.''
|-
!Stan
|And don't stop 'till you've covered that sign with glitter! Glittery signs attract tourists! Also large birds.

!
|''A bald eagle attacks Soos and he tries to run away from it.''
|-
!Stan
|Ha ha! That's funny.

|Okay, is it just me, or is having Grunkle Stan as a boss seriously the worst?

|I gave him a suggestion to improve the Shack once. I had this idea where I could be, like, the Mystery Shack mascot: Questiony the Question Mark. I ask people questions, you know. Do the question dance.
|-
!Mabel
|That sounds amazing!
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, cool!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, totally!
|-
!Soos
|Yeah, well...Stan said I couldn't handle it.
|-
!Mabel
|He said what?!
|-
!
|''Cuts to Stan saying goodbye to the tourists outside of the Shack.''
|-
!Stan
|And remember, folks! We put the "fun" in "no refunds!" ''(Walking back into the Shack)'' Ha ha. Suckers.
|-
!Mabel
|You!
|-
!Stan
|Ah!
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, you've gone too far this time! ''(Following him into his office)'' Did you seriously tell Soos not to follow his hopes and dreams because he "couldn't handle it?"
|-
!Stan
|Look, kid, let me break it down for you. Being a boss is about commanding respect. If you give people everything they ask for, they'll walk all over ya.
|-
!Mabel
|No way! I bet you'd make ''way'' more money being nice then being a big grumpy grump to everyone all the time.
|-
!Stan
|Ha! You think you know more about business than I do? You think you could wear this hat?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah! 'Cause I give people respect! And glittery stickers! ''(Stamps a pink star sticker on her left cheek)''
|-
!Stan
|Ha! I'd make more money on vacation then you would, running this place!
|-
!Mabel
|Then why don't you ''go'' on vacation?
|-
!Stan
|Interesting...All right, I'm a wagering man. 3 days. 72 hours. ''(Sets an alarm for 72 hours)'' You run the Shack, and I'll go on vacation. If you make more money than me, I guess it means you're right about the way I run my business. BUT if you lose, you, uh... ''(writes "LOSER" in marker on a white T-shirt)'' You have to wear this "LOSER" shirt all summer!
|-
!Mabel
|Fine. But if I win I get to be the boss for the rest of the summer! Plus, you gotta sing an apology song with lyrics by me! Mabel.
|-
!Stan
|Whoa ho! You got yourself a deal, missy!
|-
!Mabel
|No, you got ''yourself'' a deal!
|-
!Stan
|Deal!
|-
!Mabel
|Deal!
|-
!Stan
|''(Slams his fist on the desk)'' Deal!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Slams her fist on the desk) ''Deal!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Stamps a pink heart sticker on Stan's nose)'' Deal...
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan loading things onto the trunk of the [[Stanmobile]].''
|-
!Stan
|See you in 72 hours! We'll see who makes more money. ''(Throws his fez on Mabel's head and drives away, laughing)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Comes out)'' Did you just make a bet with a professional con man?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, come on. Being a better boss than Stan will be a cinch. Profit, here we come! ''(Holds up a jar, then drops it and it breaks)''
|-
!Dipper
|You broke the jar.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Interrupting:)'' We'll get a new one.
|-
!Dipper
|I guess I shouldn't be too worried. I mean, how much money could Stan even make on vacation?
|-
!
|''Cuts to a man writing on a clipboard.''
|-
!Man
|Can I help you, sir?
|-
!Stan
|I'm here to take all the cash from your wheel. (''Camera zooms out showing that Stan is at Cash Wheel)''
|-
!
|''Cuts to Soos, Dipper, and Wendy coming into Stan's office.''
|-
!Soos
|You wanted to see us, Mr. Pines?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Turns around in chair and scoots toward them)'' Stan is no longer with us.
|-
!Soos
|He's dead? No! It should have been me!
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, Soos! Stan's not dead! He's on vacation for 3 days. We made a bet.
|-
!Soos
|Thank you for that clarification.
|-
!Mabel
|Mabel's in charge now!
|-
!Dipper
|Are those... shoulder pads?
|-
!Mabel
|Uh huuuuuuh! (''shakes shoulder pads up and down'') It's just one of the up-to-date managerial tricks I learned from this book I found propping up the kitchen table.
|-
!
|(''Holds up [[Succeeding In Management 1983]]; Drinks out of a mug that says "#2 boss"'')
|-
!Dipper
|Why does your mug say "#2"?
|-
!Mabel
|Because the real #1... is you! ''(holds a mirror up to them)''
|-
!Dipper, Soos and Wendy
|''(laugh, pleased)''
|-
!Soos
|Morale!
|-
!Mabel
|Walk with me. With me as boss you're gonna notice a few changes around here. My job is to help you be your best "SELVES." Satisfied, Everyday, Loving Life, Very Much, Everyday, Satisfied. Great listening ears so far! ''(Stamps a thumbs up sticker on each of them)'' Waddles, hold my calls!
|-
!
|''Waddles grabs the phone with his mouth. Mabel, Dipper, Wendy and Soos arrive at the gift shop, and Mabel pulls up a chair.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, people, now rap with me. Wendy, how can I make your work space more Wendy-friendly?
|-
!Wendy
|Hmm, well, Stan never lets me hang out with friends at work.
|-
!Mabel
|Stan ain't here, sister! Door's open!
|-
!Wendy
|Sweet!
|-
!Mabel
|And Soos, I believe this is yours. ''(Pulls out a Questiony the Question Mark costume from a cabinet)''
|-
!Soos
|Questiony the Question Mark!? I wish this was an exclamation point to show how excited I am!
|-
!Mabel
|As for you Dipper... ''(Holds up Dipper's wolf costume and tosses it in a shredder)'' Die, wolf costume, die! I want you to head into the woods, and don't come back until you found an amazing attraction!
|-
!Dipper
|Finally! It's time to show Stan how a REAL mystery hunter does it! ''(Runs off, grabs a flail and opens the window)'' Dipper out! ''(The flail's weight causes him to fall of the window)''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, guys! It's time to prove that nice bosses finish first. In the next forty-eight hours, we're gonna fill this jar with six hundred billion dollars! ''(Draws a line on the jar)''
|-
!Soos and Mabel
|Yeah! ''(they high five)''
|-
!Wendy
|Wait. Do you know how money works?
|-
!Mabel
|Of course. Waddles, run down to the shop and grab me a latte. ''(gives Waddles a bill and he eats it)'' Whoa! ''(gives him another bill and he eats it again)'' He's a hungry little guy.
|-
!
|''Cuts to Stan in a line for an audition for Cash Wheel.''
|-
!Stan
|Ugh! This line is taking forever! Time to use my old man powers...AH! I'm having a heart attack! And the only cure is to be a contestant on... on Cash Wheel! Aaugh! Someone give me a part! I'm old!
|-
!
|''Several people go over to Stan and try to call people to help.''
|-
!Clipboard Man
|Should we escort him off the lot?
|-
!Cash Wheel Man
|That man is a self-centered attention hog, with no regard for human decency.'' (Pause)'' Get him on T.V!
|-
!Singer
|''(Over a montage of Mabel giving herself a thumbs up in the mirror, letting sunlight in the room, drinking a milkshake, looking at a profit graph that is going down and making a smiley face out of it)''

Whoa, yeah!

Come on, girls!

Shoulder pads!

Make that money!

Mabel's the boss now!

Walk in, girls!

Show them boys!

Make that money!

Ooooooo, ooooooo, oooo, oooo, ooooo, ooooooooo!
|-
!Mabel
|''(to Wendy:)'' Top marks!'' (to Soos:)'' Top marks! ''(to a squirrel, which runs away:)'' Top marks! ''(spinning around in her chair)'' Boss boss boss boss boss! ''(Later, Mabel puts up a poster of an Eagle and underneath it are the words "Leadership." However, Mabel has taped a picture of her face on top of the eagle's)'' It's beautiful...
|-
!
|''Tourists are seen exiting and dropping money into Mabel's jar.''
|-
!Mabel
|Thank you! Ha ha! See you soon! Tell 'em Mabel sent you! ''(Looks happily at the money in the jar)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Comes up with a large moving bag)'' Mabel! I captured something! This is gonna blow those tourists away! Ha ha! ''(The creature inside the bag grabs Dipper's arm, and Dipper punches it repeatably, and the creature lets go.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Marvelous work, valued employee! ''(gasps)'' Who's that? Is it Questiony the Question Mark?
|-
!Soos
|Uh, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this, Mabel. I keep forgetting my lines. And this costume is more um...'' (steps out from behind the porta-potty, showing he only has his foam Question mark and underwear on'') revealing than I expected?
|-
!Mabel
|Soos, don't give up. Anything is possible when you...''(flips through "Succeeding in Management 1983")'' imaginize it!
|-
!Soos
|But I don't know what that means.
|-
!Mabel
|Ssh. ''(puts finger to Soos' lips)'' Ssshssssshshsshsssh. ''(rubs finger around Soos' face'') Believe in yourself...''(walks away)''
|-
!Soos
|Bu-but I...! So-so cold...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Enters The Mystery Shack)'' How's my favorite Wendy?
|-
!
|''A can of soda falls on the ground, and Mabel looks up to see [[Lee]], [[Nate]], [[Tambry]], [[Thompson]], and Wendy wrecking the gift shop while kicking around a shrunken head''
|-
!Wendy
|Keep it going!
|-
![[Billy]]
|''(Holding up a box)'' Oh, what's this? ''(gets hit in the face with the shrunken head and cries)''
|-
![[Billy's mother|Billy's Mom]]
|Billy! Your face, it's ruined!
|-
!Mabel
|I'm so sorry. Please, have a refund. ''(Gives money)''
|-
!Billy's Mom
|''(Takes more money out of the jar and leaves with Billy)''
|-
!Mabel
|Wendy, you got a lot of cleaning up to do. Pleeeaaase. ''(Pokes the "please" sticker on the cash register)''
|-
!Wendy
|Whoa, all this rule stuff's starting to make you sound like Stan.
|-
!Mabel
|What?! No! I'm nothing like Stan! In fact, ''(nervously:) ''take the rest of the day off?
|-
!Wendy
|With full pay?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Nervously)'' Of course. ''(Shifts her suit around and laughs nervously, while Wendy gives a "thumbs up" and leaves)''
|-
!Mabel
|Mabel Pines, you are the best boss ever. ''(Mabel pats herself)''

|-
!Rich
|Ha ha ha, okay, It's going to be a long night, folks.
|-
!Cash Wheel Audience
|''(Laughs)''
|-
!Rich
|It's time to solve-
|-
!Stan
|''(laughs)''
|-
!Cash Wheel host
|It's uh, time to solve that puzzle! [[Carla (game show host)|Carla]]!
|-
!Carla
|Yes, Rich?
|-
!Stan
|Are there any "s"es?
|-
!Rich
|Actually, it's not your turn yet.
|-
!
|''Two "S"es appear on the first slot and the last slot of the Cash Wheel board.''
|-
!Stan
|I'm ready to solve!
|-
!Rich
|No, the game hasn't started-
|-
!Stan
|Is it "shut your yaps"?
|-
!
|''The answer appears on the board. The audience claps.''
|-
!Rich
|Well played.
|-
!Stan
|''(Spins the wheel)'' Cash shower, cash shower, cash shower! ''(The wheel lands on Cash shower)''
|-
!Rich
|Cash shower!

!Stan
|Yes! Doodle do...''(Starts to undress)''
|-
!Host
|Mr. Pines? No! You don't need to take your clothes off! Nope! ''(Goes in front of camera) ''Go to commercial! Go to commercial!
|-
!
|''Cuts to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ladies and Gentlemen! My name's Honest Dipper, and unlike my cheating uncle, I have something to show you that ''isn't'' a hoax! It nearly killed me getting him into that cage, behold, part gremlin, part goblin, the [[Gremloblin]]! ''(Takes the cover off the cage)''
|-
!Gremloblin
|''(Growling and pulling on the cage bars; Roars more and spits out a human skeleton arm)''
|-
!Man
|Well that's fun.
|-
!Woman
|It's fake, honey. You can see the strings.
|-
!Dipper
|What!? Those aren't strings, that's body hair!
|-
!Woman
|Oh, look at this dear. The Six-packalope. 
|-
!Man
|''(laughs)'' Wordplay!'' (takes a picture)''
|-
!Dipper
|No, everything else here is fake. ''(pulls the couple back over to the cage)'' This is a real paranormal beast. Hey, fun fact about this little guy, if you look into his eyes, you can see your worst nightmare.
|-
!Man and Woman
|''(Look into the Gremloblin's eyes; eyes start to glow)''
|-
!Dipper
|Amazing, right? I work for tips.
|-
!
|''Ambulance comes to take the scarred couple away.''
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks again for visiting! ''(sighs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(helping customers) ''Thanks for shopping with us! ''(As kids knock over a stand)'' I'll get that! Here you go. ''(flattens a dollar that someone was trying to put in the vending machine)'' Sorry. Have a refund. ''(Takes money from customers and hands all the items to the customer in front)'' That's the Mabel difference....''(sighs)''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, I just made two people go insane. How about you?
|-
!Mabel
|I'm so tired. I gave Wendy the day off so I had to do her job.
|-
!Dipper
|Well, maybe you need to start being a little bit tougher around here.
|-
!Mabel
|No way, that's what Stan would do! I just need to think positive, be friendly, and everything will work out fine.
|-
!
|''Gremloblin roars and breaks through the wall. Tourists scream and run out of the shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|What? How did he get out of his locked cage!?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looks guilty)'' Well...
|-
!
|''Flashback to Gremloblin in the cage, looking up at a key Mabel taped on the ceiling for his "5 min break"''
|-
!Dipper
|YOU GAVE HIM A BREAK?!
|-
!Mabel
|He's an employee...sort of.
|-
!Dipper
|We've got to round him up. Where's Soos?
|-
!Mabel
|He was stressed out so I told him to take a soothing nature walk.
|-
!Soos
|''(outside somewhere in the woods)'' Hello? Civilization? ''(Thunder booms and a wolf howls)'' Doggy?
|-
!
|''Cut back to the shack. Dipper and Mabel see a television playing "Cash Wheel."''
|-
!Rich
|Ladies and Gentlemen, Stan Pines is poised to become our grand champion! Anything to say to your fans out there? 
|-
!Stan
|See you tomorrow night, Mabel! ''(Holds up the "Loser" shirt)''
|-
!
|''Gremloblin roars and throws a Mayan calendar inches away from where Dipper and Mabel are. Mabel and Dipper run past and hide in the living room. The Gremloblin starts putting stickers on his face.''
|-
!Mabel
|What do we do? He's awarding himself stickers that he didn't even earn!
|-
!Dipper
|''(opens [[Journal 3|3]])'' Uh, got it! When fighting a gremloblin, use water...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Splashes a cup of water in the creature's face and he roars)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(turns page)'' ...only as a last resort as water will make him much much scarier! AH! Who writes sentences like that!?
|-
!
|''Gremloblin roars and grows spines. Cuckoo Clock chimes and he breathes fire on it.''
|-
!Dipper
|Don't worry, he's gotta leave eventually!
|-
!
|''(much later)''
|-
!Singin' Salmon
|[[Singin' Salmon|I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin']]. ''(Gremloblin presses the button again) ''I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin.' ''(Gremloblin presses the button and the fish repeats it again)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ughh, why doesn't he just leave?
|-
!Gremloblin
|''(Sniffs the money jar and starts eating the money)''
|-
!Mabel
|Our profits! ''(runs over to the monster)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, wait!
|-
!Mabel
|Stop, stop!
|-
!
|''(Gremloblin looks at her and grabs her. Mabel screams)''
|-
!Dipper
|Don't look into his evil eye; you'll see your worst nightmare!
|-
!Mabel
|I wish ''we'' had an evil eye to show him! ''(looks into the Gremloblin's eye)'' Oh no! Ahh...
|-
!Dipper
|Wait. Hey, monster! Take a look at this! ''(Shows the Gremloblin a mirror)''
|-
!Gremloblin
|''(imagines himself looking in a mirror wearing glasses; in the nightmare:)'' You've become your father. ''(In real life, screams, breaks through the wall and runs away)''
|-
!Dipper
|Well at least he didn't do ''that'' much damage.
|-
!Gremloblin
|''(Grows wings and flies away, breaking the totem pole and setting off a car alarm)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh boy.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, it's the third day! We've only got 7 hours to earn back our profits, or I've got to wear that loser shirt all summer!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Walks over with Soos)'' Hey guys! Am I nuts, or does this place look different?
|-
!Mabel
|Wendy, Soos! Am I glad to see you. We've got a lot of work to do but if we hurry, we can still beat Stan!
|-
!Wendy
|Uh, yeah. I've got a little headache, so maybe I should like, not work today.
|-
!Soos
|And I actually just met this pack of wolves, and I think they're gonna like, raise me as one of their own, so I should really be at the den right now.
|-
!Mabel
|But-but...
|-
!Wendy
|But hey, see ya on Monday.
|-
!Soos
|''(Pointing to popsicles on the ground)'' Uh, BT dubs, is anyone gonna eat these?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Twitches angrily, breaking the pen in her hand)'' ENOUGH! I have HAD IT! I fought a monster to save this business, and this is how you repay me?! I'm gonna get an ulcer from your lollygagging!
|-
!Wendy
|Lollygagging?
|-
!Soos
|Ulcer? You're acting... different.
|-
!Mabel
|You shut your yaps! I've been doing everyone's job while you bums have been bleeding me dry!
|-
!Wendy
|But I-
|-
!Mabel
|No buts except yours on the floor cleaning! Now quit loafing and get to work!
|-
!Wendy
|Yes, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|That's yes, BOSS! ''(Slams her hand on the counter and Stan's fez falls and lands on her head. She looks in the mirror and gasps) ''Dipper, what have I become?
|-
!Dipper
|What you had to, Mabel. What you had to.
|-
!Mabel
|We've got seven hours to turn this around! Let's go, people! ''(holds up money jar)''
|-
!
|''(Cut to Cash Wheel. The wheel lands on "Cash flood.")''
|-
!Rich
|You landed on Cash Flood!
|-
!Stan
|''(Gets covered in money)'' I'm givin' none of this to charity!
|-
!Rich
|And now you can go home a thousandaire! Or you could risk everything to double your money with the bonus word!
|-
!Stan
|Rich, I'm a simple man. So I'm gonna take my winnings, pack my bags, and... BET THEM ALL ON THE BONUS WORD! Come on! ''(people cheer)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the shack. A crane is repairing the totem pole.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(yelling into a megaphone:) ''Time is money, hard hat! You got complaints, file them with the complaint department! ''(holds up a trash can)'' Ughh, my back. ''(tour bus pulls up)'' Dipper, we've got tourists at 9 o'clock!
|-
!Dipper
|But what do I show them? Real magic just freaks people out.
|-
!Mabel
|Figure something out, knucklehead!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper back inside the shack, wearing a tuxedo with an eye patch, giving the tourists a tour.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ladies and gentle-tourists! This shack is filled with wonders, NEVER before seen by human eyes! Behold, the horrible giant question baby! ''(Directs their attention to Soos dressed in his Questiony the Question mark outfit)''
|-
!Soos
|Am I a man? Am I a baby? These are legitimate questions.
|-
!
|''The tourists gasp.''
|-
!Dipper
|Have your picture taken with it for a buck. Uh, ten bucks. ''(Adds a zero after the 1)'' A hundred bucks! ''(Adds another after the other 0)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the tourists leaving happy.''
|-
!Dipper
|We put the fun in no refunds! ''(Goes back into the shack)'' How'd we do?
|-
!Mabel
|We filled the whole jar! ''(Everyone cheers)''
|-
!Dipper
|Minus the money to replace all the furniture. And supplies to fix the shack, that leaves us... ''(Puts all this into a calculator, which prints out some paper)''
|-
!Mabel
|One dollar.
|-
!Stan
|''(Enters with a clock buzzing)'' Tick-tock! Time's up, kids!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, no!
|-
!Stan
|''(To Dipper:)'' Nice to see you learned how to dress while I was gone.
|-
!Mabel
|How much did you beat us by?
|-
!Stan
|I won $300,000! And then...
|-
!
|''Flashback to the Cash Wheel.''
|-
!Rich
|For a chance to double your cash or lose it all, what is the six-letter word you use to ask for something politely? For example, "May I blank have that?"
|-
!Stan
|Do I look like an idiot, folks? The word is "gimmee." Two E's.
|-
!Rich
|Oooh! You know, because you've gone this far, we're gonna give you one more chance. Let's try again. It's a "P" word. Some might even say it's the "magic word."
|-
!Stan
|Pabracadabra! Final answer!
|-
!Rich
|I'm sorry, Stan, but the word is...
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Mabel
|Please?
|-
!Stan
|Apparently that word ''can'' make you money.
|-
!Dipper
|So, wait. If you lost everything, then that means...Mabel! You won!
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Wendy
|We did it!
|-
!Soos
|Wait. What did we win again?
|-
!Stan
|Well, according to our bet, I guess Mabel's the new boss?
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Wendy and Soos
|No! No! Don't do that!
|-
!Stan
|Huh? What?
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, I had no idea how hard it was being boss. This place was cuckoo bananas until I started barking orders at people like you. ''(Hands him his fez)''
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, well, I got to admit, It's kind of nice to be back, ya know? Okay, okay, that's enough, get offa me! And Soos, Wendy; get to work! Ahem. Please. Uhh! Still hurts.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, didn't your agreement say something about Stan having to do some kind of apology dance if he lost?
|-
!Stan
|N-no. No, it didn't.
|-
!Mabel
|Actually, yeah, I think I have it in my notes here.
|-
!Stan
|No! That never happened!
|-
!Wendy
|Ha ha! I'll get the camera!
|-
!Stan
|All right, let me just... ''(Runs away)''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan!!
|-
!
|''Cuts to credits. A camera is filming Stan, who is dressed in a sparkly orange suit.''
|-
!Stan
|Uh, look, I'm not gonna...
|-
!Mabel
|Do it!
|-
!Stan
|"I'm Stan, and I was wrong,

I'm singing the [[Stan Wrong Song]],

I shouldn't have taken that chance,

Now here's my remorseful dance."
|-
!Mabel
|Do the kicks! ''(As Stan kicks)'' Jazzier!
|-
!Stan
|''(His fez falls off; to [[Gompers]], who tries to eat it:)'' Hey, gimme that! Ow! My back!
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Waddles:)'' What do you think?
|-
!Waddles
|Oink!
|-
!Mabel
|Take thirty!

|-
!Stan Pines
|In this land of ours, there are many great pits. But none more bottomless than the bottomless pit. Which as you can see here is bottomless.
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|Question. Is it bottomless?
|-
!Stan

|-
![[Dipper Pines]]
|Grunkle Stan, why are we here again?

|What you got there, Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, it's just my personal box of mysterious secrets. Nothing worth wondering about. ''(Giggles and pushes the box down the pit)'' Goodbye forever!
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, do I really have to be the one to point out that a bottomless pit is, by definition, impossible?
|-
!Stan
|''(Shaking cards out of his fez down the pit)'' Says you.
|-
!Mabel 
|Well, I guess we'll never know.

|Aah! It's some sort of invisible pushing force!
|-
!Dipper
|Quick! Everyone back to the shack! ''(Runs toward the house)''

!Stan
|I'm not done getting rid of these yet! ''(Tries throwing more cards into the bottomless pit but the wind blows them into his face)''

|We're gonna land on something eventually. It could be any second now.

|''Everyone braces for a landing but nothing happens.''

|-
!Mabel
|''(Claps)''
|-
!Soos
|Hey, maybe we should pass the time by telling stories.
|-
!Dipper
|I've got a story. It's called the time Grunkle Stan got us all thrown into a bottomless pit where we spent the rest of our NATURAL LIVES!
|-
!Soos
|Go on...
|-
!Mabel
|Come on, Dipper, you can do better than that.
|-
!Dipper
|Fine. ''(Takes the glow stick)'' I'll tell you a story. A story I'd like to call "Voice Over." ''(Title card appears; Mabel, [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]], Soos are on the lawn with [[Waddles]].)''

|I'm not gonna answer that question.

!Dipper
|''(Runs up)'' Guys! I think I just got bit by a snake! I need you to get me to a hospital quick!

|-
!Dipper
|What? What's so funny?
|-
!Stan
|Sorry. It's just hard to focus on what you're saying with that squeaky puberty voice you got there.
|-
!Dipper
|My what?
|-
!Mabel
|It's nothing to be ashamed of, Dipper. Your voice is ''(Imitating Dipper:)'' hillaaarrious!
|-
!Dipper
|Are you saying my voice cracks? My voice doesn't crack!
|-
!Soos
|Dude, no offense, but it cracks so much we've already made a [[Dipper's Voice Remix|techno remix]] out of it. ''(Plays the tape)''

|-
!Mabel
|I know boys' voices change, but this is weird. Weird and bad.
|-
!Dipper
|But Mabel, this is the best thing that has ever happened to me. And just think of the prank calls. ''(Dials a number)''

|-
!Dipper
|What gives, man? You guys all made fun of my old voice. I thought you'd like the new one.
|-
!Soos
|Well, at least before you sounded like a real person. Now, you sound like some weird commercial dude.
|-
!Dipper
|I'll find Stan. He'll like my new voice. You'll see. I'll be right back after these messages!.. I mean... goodbye. ''(Goes outside and downtown)'' Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan! Where are you, Grunkle Stan? ''(Walks by [[Skull Fracture]])''
|-

|Huh? I know that voice anywhere! You're that guy that prank-called me earlier!

|No I'm not. I'm a 12 year old boy.

|-
!McGucket
|That's probably why I live in a dump! ''(Dances)''
|-
!Dipper
|My own sister didn't recognize me. I scared away crowds. ''(Sobs)'' I even sound ridiculous when I cry.
|-
!McGucket
|Well, now. Here's your problem. I gave you the wrong drinking majiggy. This one's for voice over professionals. I'm sure I got a better voice in here somewhere. ''(Digs through car trunk)''

|-
!Dipper
|I guess I realized that even though my voice may not be perfect, it's still mine, and I wouldn't change it for anything, not even for whatever was in this new vial.
|-
!Mabel
|So, what did you do with the rest of that potion?
|-
!Dipper
|I dumped it in Stan's coffee.

|-
!Soos
|Really? Okay. ''(Dipper screams as he spins and floats at background)'' This story is called "Soos' really good Pinball story. Is that a good title? Does it have to be a pun or whatever?" ''(Title card appears. Cut to Soos, Dipper, and Mabel in the pinball room. Soos is playing pinball.)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
|-
!Soos
|This is it, dudes. After 4 long years of trying, I might finally get a high score on Stan's creepy old pinball machine. If I do this, I'll go down in pinball history, with the likes of Sal, Gaff, and of course, Poo.
|-
!Dipper
|Have you ever tried maybe tilting the machine?
|-
!Soos
|I don't know, dudes, isn't breaking the rules like, against the rules?
|-
!Mabel
|Nuts to the rules! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt! 
|-
!Soos
|''(Loses)''
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Failure! You stink!
|-
!Soos
|All right, that's it! Are you ready, kids?
|-
!Mabel and Dipper
|''(Tilting the machine)'' Tilt! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt! 
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Quit tiltin', partner. Quit tiltin'!
|-
!Soos
|Tilt! ''(tilts the ball into the goal)''
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Bulls-eye! New high score!
|-
!Mabel, Dipper and Soos
|''(Cheering)''
|-
!Soos
|This is the best moment of my life. This totally beats my old best moment. ''(Flashback to Soos pressing the eject button on a VHS player and a piece of pizza comes out. Soos picks up the pizza and prepares to eat it. Cut back to the present.)''
|-
!Pinball Machine
|That ain't right. You cheated.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, yeah. What are you gonna do about it? You're just a Pinball game, Pinball game. Taunt, taunt.
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, guys, there's an awful lot of green lightning coming out of that game.
|-
!Soos
|No, that's the normal amount of green lightning.
|-
!
|''Lightning strikes them. Cut to Soos wearing cowboy clothes in the pinball game.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Lying down and hitting a buzzer)'' Uh, 5 more minutes.''(gets up)'' Ah! That's not a normal alarm clock.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs up with Mabel; they are also wearing old west themed clothes)'' Soos! We're inside the game! Crazy!
|-
!Mabel
|Sweet Moses!
|-
!Soos
|Hushed exclamation of wonder!
|-
!Dipper
|Awesome!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Jumping around on the buzzers)'' Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing!
|-
!Soos
|Dude, if this is a dream, I never want to wake up!
|-
!Pinball Machine
|That can be arranged. Welcome to [[Tumbleweed Terror]], partners.
|-
!Soos
|Hey, it's the skeleton cowboy guy. Did you zap me into your game to congratulate me on getting my new score? I beat Poo, dude!
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Pardon, and if'n I do recall, I did warned y'all not to cheat. I tried to be gentleman-like, but I'm plum sick of being tilted. So, now I reckon, I'm gonna tilt you.
|-
!Soos
|Well, take this! ''(Hits a button but hits himself in the eye)'' Ow! And this! ''(Punches himself again)'' Ow! It hurts. I wish this was working better. And this! Aw, dude! ''(Knocks himself out)''

!
|''Dipper, Mabel, and Soos run behind a wall.''
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Where are you? I'm not done teaching you a lesson about cheating yet.
|-
!Dipper
|How are we gonna get out of here? Think, guys.
|-
!Soos
|I'm trying. But it's hard with that gorgeous pinball wench distracting me. ''(Waves at a cutout of a woman)'' Okay. Don't worry, guys, I know every inch of this machine. There's a manual power switch inside. I can sneak in there and turn off the game. But we'll have to distract the cowboy guy. Are any of you good at jumping up and down and making annoying noises?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hair blowing in wind)'' My time has come.
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, let's go, Soos. Soos?
|-
!Soos
|''(To the pinball wench:)'' So are you, like, doing anything later?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Kicks the wench)''
|-
!Soos
|Oh, right.
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Come on out and show yourselves, varmints.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Jumps up on a buzzer)'' Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at me and listen to what I'm doing! BUZZZZZZ! DISTRACTION! DISTRACTION! LA! LA! LA! LA! LA!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sings)''
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Something ain't right here. Let me see where this is going.
|-
!Soos
|''(Gets in a cart, rolls down behind the pinball machine)''
|-
!Pinball Machine
|Ha ha ha ha. Yippy ti yi what? Where are ya? ''(Tries to turn)'' Darnit, I wish I had a neck.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, pssssst. What's going on? Just press the switch already!
|-
!Soos
|Okay, so I was gonna do that, but I've been thinking. According to this, turning off the power erases the high score permanently. That score is like my one big life accomplishment.
|-
!Dipper
|What? If you don't hurry up, we could die in here!
|-
!Soos
|Fair point. But, what is life anyway when compared to the immortality of a high score?
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, are you out of your--!
|-
!Pinball Machine
|There y'all are. Get ready to meet your maker, kids. My maker is Ballway Games in Redmond, Washington. ''(inhales)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Being sucked toward the cowboy skull)'' Woooooaah!
|-
!Dipper
|Soos!
|-
!Mabel
|Soos, please!
|-
!Dipper
|Turn it off!
|-
!Soos
|Uhhh Uhh. Goodbye, high score. ''(Pushes the button and the pinball game turns off. He and the twins wake up outside of the game)'' Woah! You dudes okay?
|-
!Mabel
|Yes! You did it! You freed us!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey man, I'm sorry you had to lose your high score.
|-
!Soos
|That's Okay. I've got a new life accomplishment now. Saving you dudes.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Awwwww.
|-
!Soos
|You think that pinball wench will call me?
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Stan
|I can't believe this nonsense. Magic tonics? Soos winning at something? Where did you come up with this stuff? I'll tell you a good story. It's called "Grunkle Stan wins the football bowl". ''(Cut to a football stadium. Stan makes a touchdown and dances.)''
|-
![[Unnamed football players|Football player]]
|Mr. Pines, I thought that old folks were useless, but you taught me and my gloating friends a lesson.
|-
![[Unnamed beautiful woman|Beautiful Woman]]
|''(Arriving in a gigantic trophy)'' Here is your football winning trophy, Mr. Pines.
|-
!Stan
|Thanks, beautiful woman. But I couldn't have done it without my sidekick, [[Footbot]].
|-
!Footbot
|Thank you for building me, Daddy!
|-
!
|''Stan and football players laugh as fireworks go off.''
|-
!Footbot
|I love you, Stan.

!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Soos, Dipper and Mabel
|Boooooo!
|-
!Stan
|What? That story was great! I even threw in a talking robot for the kids.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna tell a non-terrible story. A story called "Trooth Ache!" ''(Title card appears. Dipper, Mabel, and Stan are in the driveway while Manly Dan ties up a bear.)''
|-
!Stan
|This attraction is gonna make me a fortune. Easy with that bear, Corduroy! I need him in showroom condition.
|-
!Bear
|''(Roars)''
|-
![[Manly Dan]]
|No, Noo! ''(wrestles the bear)''
|-
!Mabel
|Aaaaawww. They're hugging.
|-
!Dipper
|So, let me get this straight. Your plan is to teach a bear to ride a bicycle?
|-
!Stan
|No. Come on, everyone's seen a bicycle-riding bear. No, no. I'm gonna teach this bear... to drive! ''(Cut to Stan's car driving crazily on the road. The bear is driving, Stan is in the passenger seat, and Dipper and Mabel are in the back seat.)'' And the yellow light means speed up. ''(Hears cops' siren noise)'' Uh oh.
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|''(stops Stan's car)''
|-
!Stan
|What seems to be the problem, officers?
|-
![[Sheriff Blubs]]
|There better be a darn good explanation for this.
|-
!Stan
|Oh, there is. You see, I'm a very old man. Not long for this Earth. And the doctors assigned me a seeing eye bear to drive me to the hospital in case of an emergency.
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Is that right? Then, where is your doctor's note?
|-
!Stan
|Why, it's right here, inside my jacket. ''(writes note inside jacket quickly)'' There you go. ''(gives them the note, which says "Stan is sick and needs a bear. -Dr. Medicine")''
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Well, I can't argue with Dr. Medicine.
|-
!Stan
|To the hospital, honeypants!
|-
!Bear
|(''roars and drives away)''
|-
!
|''Cuts to later in the Mystery Shack. Stan is painting rocks under a sign titled "Real Gold!" Mabel walks up to him.''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, how could you lie to those policemen? Don't you know lying is always wrong?
|-
!Stan
|Mabel, when you get to be my age, you'll learn that you sometimes have to bend the truth for the greater good. ''(eats spaghetti)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(comes in)'' Hey, have any of you seen my plate of spaghetti?
|-
!Stan
|''(hides spaghetti behind him while turning around to Dipper)'' No... But I bet Soos has. You know how he likes to eat.
|-
!Dipper
|This is a dark day. Thanks, Grunkle Stan. ''(runs off)''
|-
!Stan
|See? Greater good.
|-
!Mabel
|Aaaaah!
|-
!
|''Cuts to Mabel lying on her bed with Waddles''
|-
!Mabel
|Waddles, what am I gonna do about Grunkle Stan? ''(As Waddles:)'' He needs to stop lying. ''(Regular voice:)'' I know, but how do we stop him? ''(As Waddles:)'' Maybe you should check Dipper's journal. Oink Oink. ''(Regular voice:)'' Say oink one more time. ''(As Waddles:)'' Oink Oink. ''(Regular voice:)'' Waddles, you genius! ''(Opens journal; reading aloud:)'' "Buried 'neath a trees stump in the deep forest are the [[Truth Telling Teeth|truth teeth]], which forces upon the wearer the inability to lie." Hmmm. ''(Cut to Stan sleeping at night. Mabel puts truth teeth in his mouth and wakes him up)''
|-
!Stan
|What? What's going on? Huh? Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|Quick question. What happened to Dipper's spaghetti plate?
|-
!Stan
|I ate it because I have little to no concern about other people's possessions or emotions. ''(Realizes what he just said)'' That was strangely candid. Almost as if I am unable to lie. Well, good night. ''(Goes to sleep)''
|-
!
|''Cut to that morning. Mabel is whispering in Dipper's ear.''
|-
!Dipper
|You what? That seems like a horrible idea!
|-
!Mabel
|It's great! Now he has to tell the truth.
|-
!Dipper
|Hmmm.
|-
!Stan
|''(Gives them plates)'' Scrambled meat, here it is.
|-
!Dipper
|Stan, what do you do in secret everyday during your lunch break?
|-
!Stan
|Usually, I spend the hour aggressively scratching myself in places I shouldn't mention. Now I'm going to avoid making eye contact by pretending to read this newspaper and going to the bathroom without washing my hands. ''(Leaves)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Eeeeeeewww!
|-
!Dipper
|Well, that was disturbing.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry, Dipper. The truth is always a good thing. ''(Cut to Stan in the gift shop)''
|-
!Unnamed man
|''(to Stan:)'' Hey, excuse me. Do you think this t-shirt is my size?
|-
!Stan
|Never mind the t-shirt! Hey everyone, look at this guy's abnormal and unattractive face!
|-
!Mabel
|''(leads man away)'' I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. ''(Cut to Stan doing taxes)''
|-
!Stan
|Doing my taxes.
|-
!Dipper
|''(looks at one of the papers, which has "I HAVE COMMITTED TAX FRAUD" on it)'' Uh, Grunkle Stan, why did you write this?
|-
!Stan
|Because I regularly commit massive tax fraud.
|-
!Dipper
|You might wanna... tuck that one away there. ''(shreds paper)''
|-
!
|''Dipper, Mabel and Stan are watching TV, where a man on a unicycle is juggling..''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Hahahahaha!
|-
!Stan
|Sometimes, I think. Is this all there is? Is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line? That we're all just biding our time until the sweet, sweet, release of death?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Rocks back and forth)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shivers)''
|-
!
|''Cut to later''
|-
!Stan
|''(Yelling up to Dipper and Mabel, who are in their room:)'' Kids, I think I have a growth forming on my back. Just wanted to be honest with you guys.
|-
!Dipper
|I can't take it anymore, Mabel! We need to take those teeth out of his mouth.
|-
!Mabel
|But then he'll be a liar again.
|-
!Dipper
|Could it possibly be any worse than this?
|-
!
|''The doorbell rings. Dipper and Mabel run downstairs, where Stan is standing in the doorway with Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland.''
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|So, after further investigation, it turns out that there is no Dr. Medicine in Gravity Falls.
|-
![[Deputy Durland]]
|You better have a darn good explanation for this.
|-
!Stan
|Oh and I do. You see, I lied to you. In addition I've been parking in handicapped spaces, shoplifting fireworks, and smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines. Also, you're fat.
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|''(Drops his coffee)'' Is all of this true?
|-
!Dipper
|No! No, it's not true. Right, Mabel? 
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, sirs, I have to be completely and totally honest with you. Our Great Uncle Stan is...is...Stan is.. secretly a crime fiction writer!
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|What?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah. He was just telling you about a character in his upcoming page turner, Crime Grandpa! He's never committed a crime in his life. Also, have you lost weight?
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Finally! Someone noticed.
|-
!Deputy Durland
|Wow, an author! Can you teach me how to read?
|-
!Stan
|What? Author?
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha, writer, master of fiction. Good night, officers. ''(Close the door and sighs)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, you alright?
|-
!Mabel
|I can't believed I lied.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, it was for the greater good.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, the greater good.

!Stan
|''(On phone:) ''Hello? Police station? I forgot to tell him about my tax fraud. No, tax fraud.

|''(Pulls out the teeth)'' We have to find a place to get rid of these! ''(Cut to Mabel throwing out the box into the bottomless pit at the beginning of the episode. In the present:)'' And I never saw that box full of magical teeth again. ''(Sees the box next to Stan)'' Oh wait, there it is.
|-
!Soos, Dipper & Stan
|''(sighs)''
|-
!Soos
|Oh, sweet! My shoes! ''(Puts his shoes back on)''
|-
!Stan
|I like the part with the bear. The rest of it seems pretty far-fetched.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, we already know that story! We just lived through it.
|-
!Soos
|If we're living through that story right now, then how does it end?
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, do you see that?
|-
!
|''They are approaching some light.''
|-
!Soos
|What is that?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no!
|-
!Mabel
|Where are we going?
|-
!Stan
|Not good!
|-
!All
|''(Scream as they fall out of the pit and onto the spot they fell from)''
|-
!Stan
|Where... where are we?
|-
!Mabel
|''(gasps)'' Look! The Shack! Which means... we came right back out the top.
|-
!Dipper
|And I don't think any time has passed. It must be some kind of wormhole.
|-
!Soos
|Yeah, dude. That sounds science-y enough to be true.
|-
!Stan
|But that's impossible. No one will believe us.
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe this is one story we should keep to ourselves.
|-
!All
|Agreed.
|-
!Stan
|''(Leans on the sign, which breaks, and he falls into the hole)''
|-
!Mabel
|He'll be fine.
|-
!
|''Cuts to credits.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Falling in silence down the hole; Sighs)'' This is stupid.

|''The episode opens on the sky, where the sun is shining, then pans down to a view of the outside of the [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
![[Toby Determined]]
|''(On the radio)'' Watch out, [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]], because at a 110 degrees, we're looking at the hottest day of the summer!
|-
!
|''(A squirrel runs into frame and erupts into flames. Cut to inside the Mystery Shack. [[Wax Stan]] melts, the wallpaper curls and peels off by itself, and water in the fish tank boils due to the heat. Cuts to [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], [[Stan Pines|Stan]], and [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] in the living room, not quite enjoying the heat.)''
|-
!Dipper Pines
|All in favor of doing nothing all day say "ugh."
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Stan, and Soos
|Ugh.
|-
!
|[[Waddles]] walks up to Stan.
|-
!Stan Pines
|I'm gonna throw this pig out of the house!
|-
!
|''(Waddles oinks and licks Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|You called my bluff, pig.
|-
!Toby
|''(On the radio)'' On the bright side, pun very much intended, it's opening week at the [[Gravity Falls Pool]].
|-
!Mabel Pines
|Gravity Falls Pool?
|-
!Dipper
|Today?
|-
!Soos Ramirez
|Pun intended?
|-
!Stan
|Quick! To the [[Stanmobile|car]]!
|-
!
|''(Stan tries to get up, but is stuck to the floor)''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, kids, a little help here?
|-
!
|''(Mabel and Dipper pull out spatulas and attempt to release Stan from the floor. Soos shudders)''
|-
!Stan
|Alright! Off to the pool!
|-
!
|''(Stan turns around, and reveals that the twins removed the wood from the floor when breaking him free. Then he goes off screen.)''
|-
!Toby
|''(On the radio)'' And remember to be on alert for random wildfires!
|-
!Stan
|''(Off screen)'' Wait, what? ''(He is heard catching on fire)'' Aaaah!
|-
!Mabel
|He'll be fine.
|-
!
|''(Cuts to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]])''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah, the pool! A sparkling oasis of summer enchantment!
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, nothing like sitting in a moist tub with strangers. It's like the bus, but wet.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looking at the towel Soos is holding)'' Why would a sun need to wear sunglasses?
|-
!Soos
|It's best not to think about it.
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, whoa! Stop the presses! Who's that?
|-
!
|''(Mabel looks at a [[Mermando|handsome young man]] whose hair is blowing in the wind)''
|-
!Soos
|Oh, yeah. ''(Eats a corn chip)'' Word is, dude never leaves the pool. People say he's a "Mysterious loner." ''(Backs away from Mabel while eating corn chips)''
|-
!Mabel
|Is it getting hot out here or is it just that guy?
|-
!Dipper
|It's the hottest day of the year, Mabel. Besides, can't you go for one week without having a new crush on some random guy?
|-
!Mabel
|Uh-uh. ''(Gasps)'' Look at his little mustache hairs!
|-
!Soos
|You are clearly enamored. Go to him.
|-
!
|''(Mabel runs across the pool, but trips across a bucket and stumbles on two men in lawn chairs.)''
|-
!Man 1
|Hey, come on!
|-
!Man 2
|Watch it kid!
|-
!Mabel
|''(While breaking her leg free from a lawn chair and knocking over a basket of beach balls)'' Aaah! Oops, sorry.
|-
!Soos
|It's so beautiful!
|-
!Dipper
|Eh, Mabel's all talk. You wanna know a secret? She's never even kissed a guy before. She always messes it up somehow.
|-
!Stan
|Oi. Women. ''(A water balloon is thrown in his face)'' Aaah!
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|Hey, Mr. Pines!
|-
!Stan
|Wendy? Where's the lifeguard?
|-
!Wendy
|I am the lifeguard. I make the rules, sucka! ''(Throws a water balloon at Stan)'' Boosh!
|-
!Stan
|Aah! She's attacking me with water!
|-
!
|''(Wendy, Soos, and Dipper laugh.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wow. You work here?
|-
!Wendy
|I found out lifeguards get free snack privileges. Plus I get the best seat in the house.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, you do! ''(Laughs, then whispers)'' I've been laughing for too long...
|-
!Soos
|Dude, are you and Wendy having a secret staring contest? 'Cause I think you're winning—
|-
!Dipper
|Soos! Shh! ''(Pushes Soos away, Wendy looks confused)'' So, hey, you wanna go chuck more water balloons at Grunkle Stan?
|-
!Wendy
|I'd love to, but I gotta spend the day doing tryouts. We're looking for a new assistant lifeguard.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, ''(Clears throat; deeper voice)'' hey. ''(Normal voice)'' What if I was the assistant lifeguard?
|-
!Wendy
|That would be so much fun! You're totally in, dude! ''(Throws a rescue can at Dipper; he catches it)'' You just have to check in with my boss first, [[Mr. Poolcheck]].
|-
!Dipper
|Your boss?
|-
!
|''(It shows a masculine man doing push ups with his index fingers. He turns in Dipper's direction; Dipper gasps.)''
|-
!
|''(Cuts to the boy Mabel was attracted to. He's drinking lemonade. Suddenly, Mabel bursts out of the water.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Wow! Oh my gosh, how crazy bumping into you even though we don't know each other!
|-
!Mermando
|How long have you been underwater?
|-
!Mabel
|That doesn't matter! ''(Coughs up a band-aid)'' So, hey! My name's Mabel.
|-
!Mermando
|''(In Spanish)'' Hola.
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa! Are you Australian?
|-
!Mermando
|''(Laughs)'' I am charmed by your sense of humor. And your bold lack of water-wings!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs)'' You're so funny! And your hair is beautiful...
|-
!Mermando
|No, no it has silly tangles!
|-
!Mabel
|Mind if I... ''(Pulls out a comb, and begins to brush Mermando's hair)''
|-
!Mermando
|Why, Mabel. You are so forward. ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Thinking)'' This is it! He likes you! Go for it, Mabel! It's time! Ask him out on a date! ''(Speaking)'' So, hey, you wanna go dry off? Maybe hit the snack bar or—?
|-
!Mermando
|I-I'm afraid I cannot! For I have a terrible secret! I must go.
|-
!
|''(He swims off, leaving Mabel by herself.)''
|-
!Mabel
|I'm upset. Yet intrigued!
|-
!
|''(Cuts to Dipper talking to Mr. Poolcheck)''
|-
!Dipper
|And that is why I think I'd make a good lifeguard assistant.
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Hmm... ''(Gets down and sniffs Dipper)'' SPF 100? Good, I like you. But this isn't an easy job. It's anarchy out there.
|-
!
|''(It shows the pool being perfectly calm.)''
|-
!Dipper
|I think I can handle it.
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Can you handle this?! ''(He pulls of his hand, revealing it to be prosthetic; Dipper screams)'' I lost my hand to a pool filter. The pool may seem friendly, but she can turn on you in an instant. Which is why you must respect her rules! Do you think you have what it takes, boy? Do you?!
|-
!
|''(Dipper looks at Wendy, who is giving him a thumbs up.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Sure. I guess.
|-
!
|''(Mr. Poolcheck puts a whistle around Dipper's neck.)''
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Welcome to the deep end, son.
|-
!Dipper
|Well, thanks, I— ''(Mr. Poolcheck strangles him in a hug.)'' Yep. Oh, this is happening.
|-
!
|''(Cut to Stan and Soos walking by the pool.)''
|-
!Stan
|There she is, Soos. Equidistant from the snack bar and the bathroom. Just the right amount of sun and shade. And pointed away from where [[Old Man McGucket]] lotions himself. 
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|Whoo-wee!
|-
!Stan
|The perfect lawn chair. ''(The chair shines in the sunlight)''
|-
!Soos
|The legends that you told me in the car were true.
|-
!Stan
|I just can't believe it wasn't already taken. And now to sit on it, thereby claiming it as my own.
|-
!
|''(Stan sits down, but a foot rests on his back just as he does)''
|-
!Stan
|What?!
|-
![[Gideon Gleeful]]
|Why, hello Stanford.
|-
!Stan
|Gideon! Get outta my chair, kid!!
|-
!Gideon
|Oh my, was this your chair. I had no idea. ''(Whispers)'' Yes I did, Stan, I knew.
|-
!Stan
|Move it, you little troll!
|-
!Gideon
|First come, first serve! ''(Giggles and rolls around on the chair)''
|-
!Stan
|I'll first serve you!
|-
!
|''(Stan picks up Gideon; suddenly the whistle blows. Cuts to Stan in pool jail.)''
|-
!Stan
|Come on, Wendy! You can't do this to an old man!
|-
!Wendy
|Sorry, Stan, it's not up to me. ''(Chuckles)'' Actually, it is.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, Wendy, I got the job!
|-
!Wendy
|Sweet! Wanna go abuse our power?
|-
!Dipper
|But what if Poolcheck catches us? He seems emotionally unstable.
|-
!
|''(Cuts to Mr. Poolcheck doing sit-ups on the chain-link fence.)''
|-
!Wendy
|Nah, don't worry, man. You just gotta be sneaky about your rule-breaking. Race you to the no running sign!
|-
!
|''(Dipper runs after her, but then sees Poolcheck, who is drinking water from the pool. Mr. Poolcheck looks at him and licks the extra water off his face. Dipper then slows down.)''
|-
!
|''(Cuts back to pool jail.)''
|-
!Kid 1
|How long you in for?
|-
!Stan
|Two hours for roughhousing, but I'm innocent!
|-
!Kid 2
|Pool jail ain't so bad... as long as you don't wind up in solitary.
|-
!
|''(Cuts to a kid trapped inside a pool vent.)''
|-
![[Pool Jail kid]]
|It's the nights that are the hardest.
|-
!
|''(Cuts back to Mermando. Mabel comes out of the water, but then drops under again when Mermando looks her direction. Again, Mabel appears, but ducks yet again when Mermando thinks he hears her. Mabel then pops out of the water.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey there! ''(Mermando screams)'' I brought you a sandwich. It's sort of wet, but it's still good. Blop.
|-
!
|''(Mabel puts the sandwich on Mermando's inflatable raft.)''
|-
!Mabel
|I like sharing things. Sandwiches, secrets. ''(Whispers)'' Share your secret, beautiful stranger.
|-
!Mermando
|That wet sandwich does look delicious.
|-
!
|''(Mermando's hair blows in the wind.)''
|-
!Mermando
|Oh, very well. But you must never tell another living soul my terrible secret.
|-
!
|''(Mabel nods.)''
|-
!Mermando
|You have to stay away from me because I am...
|-
!
|''(Mermando pushes his inflatable raft away from him.)''
|-
!Mermando
|...A [[Merpeople|merman]].
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, thank goodness. I thought you were gonna say you had a girlfriend!
|-
!
|''(Cuts to commercial break.)''
|-
!Mabel
|A merman... ha! I should have known from your strange foreign fish language.
|-
!Mermando
|It is Spanish.
|-
!Mabel
|Your voice is so deep and masculine... how old are you?
|-
!Mermando
|I am 12 years old. Merman's voices change when we are, like, 3.
|-
!Mabel
|So what's your name?
|-
!Merman
|There are some who call me... ''(plays chord on guitar)'' Mermando! This is because Mermando is my name.
|-
!Mabel
|But I don't understand Mermando. What's a guy like you doing in a public pool?
|-
!Mermando
|It is a tragic story, Mabel.
|-
!
|''(A flashback backs)''
|-
!Mermando (Narrating)
|I was swimming with my friends, the mighty dolphins, in the Gulf of Mexico, when I was ensnared!
|-
!
|''(Flashback Mermando is seen swimming with dolphins until he is caught in a fishing net and brought up next to a boat)''
|-
![[Davey]]
|''(Flashback)'' Earl, did we just catch ourselves some kind of beautiful man-fish?
|-
![[Earl]]
|''(Flashback)'' Let's feast on his flesh.
|-
!Mermando (Narrating)
|The cargo was headed for Gravity Falls.
|-
!
|''(Flashback Mermando opens up the back of a truck and hops into the lake.)''
|-
!Mermando (Narrating)
|Using all my strength, I tried to escape back home, but it was not to be.
|-
!
|''(Flashback Mermando swims up a waterfall. When he reaches the top, he laughs, but suddenly, a log hits him in the face. He falls and lands into the forest surrounding the lake. He spits a tooth out.)''
|-
!Mermando (Narrating)
|I would have died of dehydration, were if not for the kindness of the forest animals.
|-
!
|''(Flashback deer come up to flashback Mermando and start licking him.)''
|-
!Mermando (Flashback)
|''(Laughs)'' Continue licking! Oh!
|-
!
|''(Flashback Mermando falls down a pipe, through the forest, over the fence of the Gravity Falls pool, and into the pool. He gasps for air.)''
|-
!
|''(The flashback ends.)''
|-
!Mermando
|But now that you know what I am, you must be seriously weirded out.
|-
!Mabel
|What?! I don't care that you're a merman. You're, like, the coolest guy I've ever met. And you can play at least one chord on the guitar.
|-
!Mermando
|Oh, Mabel, I have never met another human like you. Would you care to join me in a game of the Marco Polo?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, yes, Mermando! Yes!
|-
!
|''(Mabel crushes Mermando in a hug.)''
|-
!Mermando
|You are covering my gills. I cannot breathe.
|-
!
|''(Mabel quickly lets go. Mermando gasps.)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Chuckles)'' Weird.
|-
!
|''Cuts to [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]] putting sunscreen on himself on the lawn chair Stan wanted.''
|-
!Gideon
|Ooh! ''(giggles)'' My cheeks are baby soft.
|-
!
|''Cuts to Stan watching Gideon from afar.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Growls)'' Look at him, that smug chair stealing jerk! But I can't touch him, or the pool patrol will throw me in pool jail. Hmm...
|-
!
|''(The light of the sun hits Stan's watch)''
|-
!Stan
|Ah!
|-
!
|''(Stan makes an attempt to shine the light on his watch at Gideon)''
|-
!Stan
|Yes. Yes! Burn the child...
|-
!
|''(Gideon holds up his goggles, which bounces the light back into Stan's eyes)''
|-
!Stan
|Aah! My eyes!
|-
!
|''(Stan falls into the pool.)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Puts his goggles on)'' Deal with it. ''(Stan comes out of the water, completely enraged)''
|-
!
|''(Cuts to Soos putting on an inflatable duck)''
|-
!Duck
|Soos.
|-
!Soos
|Inflatable duck guy, is that you?
|-
!Duck
|Yes, Soos, I can ''talk''.
|-
!Soos
|Oh my gosh, I knew you guys were secretly alive. I ''knew'' it!
|-
!
|''(Wendy and Dipper are around the corner with a megaphone, looking at Soos, as they are the ones making the inflatable duck talk. They laugh and tell each other to shush quietly.)''
|-
!Duck
|My people have been enslaved, Soos. You must free us.
|-
!Soos
|The inflatable pool duck revolution is at hand.
|-
!
|''(Dipper and Wendy laugh, but suddenly they hear a whistle.)''
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Pool's closing! Clear out everyone!
|-
!Dipper
|Poolcheck!
|-
!Wendy
|Hide!
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Out! Do not touch! Assistant Lifeguard!
|-
!
|''(Dipper stops, incredibly nervous)''
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Have a good night, son. Lock up the supplies for me.
|-
!
|''(Poolcheck takes off his hand and pats it a couple of times. A pair of keys come out of it, which Dipper nervously takes and locks up the supplies with).''
|-
!
|''(Cuts to Mabel and Mermando brushing each others hair, when the whistle blows.)''
|-
!Mermando
|The pool, she closes. Can I see you tonight?
|-
!Mabel
|Sure. Where? Wanna go for a walk?
|-
!Mermando
|Merman. I am a merman.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, right. ''(Gets out of the pool)'' Then I'll be back tonight.
|-
!
|''(At night, Mabel drives the [[Mystery Cart|golf cart]] to the pool. She climbs up the fence with a landing net. Mabel goes in the pool with Mermando.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Look! Here's a scrapbook of human stuff. ''(Points at the scrapbook)'' Here's me standing with my legs. And here I am kicking Dipper in his legs. He couldn't move his legs after that! Can you imagine? Not having legs? 
|-
!Mermando
|''(A bit angrily)'' Let's skip this part.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Points at another picture)'' And here's my whole family kick boxing!
|-
!Mermando
|''(Sighs, and stays away from Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Follows him)'' What's wrong?
|-
!
|''Mermando takes his guitar out and plays it, but it doesn't sound well. He angrily pours the water out and starts to talk.''
|-
!Mermando
|I too, used to have a family once. back in the ocean. ''(opens his necklace and looks at his family's picture.) ''How I miss them.'' ''(Closes the necklace)'
|-
!Mabel
|Mermando, why don't you just leave the pool?
|-
!Mermando
|I've tried only once, but escaping this pool required a plan that was bold and daring.
|-
!
|''Cuts to Mermando's past memory he tried to escape. He jumps out the pool but he doesn't gets far and flaps for water. He hits chairs, a parasol, and gets hit by a wood pecker. Then he rolls into the pool.''
|-
!Mermando
|And then the wolves came. ''(To Mabel, changing the topic)'' No, I'm glad that I'm here, 'cause I met you. 
|-
!
|''Next to Mermando a shooting star falls down.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Thinking)'' This is it, Mabel. First kiss moment, here we come! Just go for it! ''(Tries to kiss)''
|-
!Mermando
|What are you doing with your mouth?
|-
!Mabel
|Me? Nothing. This? I was eating some sour candy. So my lips were doing that. The candy was so sour. 
|-
!Mermando
|''(Pause)'' Can I have some candy?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pause)'' No.
|-
!
|''It becomes daytime. [[Sheriff Blubs]] and [[Deputy Durland]] are putting suncreams on. Then, Sheriff Blubs gets trapped by a life saver fallen from the top.''
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Wha-what the?
|-
!
|''Deputy Durland gets trapped too.''
|-
!Deputy Durland
|I'm scared!
|-
!Blubs
|Me too!
|-
!
|''The camera pans up showing Wendy and Dipper were throwing the life savers.''
|-
!Dipper
|One hundred points!
|-
!Wendy
|Dude! With this job, you and me are gonna be havin' fun all summer!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Blushing)'' All summer?
|-
!
|''Mr. Poolcheck blows a whistle.''
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|''(Pointing Blubs and Durland)'' Pines! Here! Now!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mr. Poolcheck in front the pool supplies building''
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|You gave me your word that you would respect the safety rules of this pool!
|-
!Dipper
|Mr. Poolcheck? Are you crying?
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|That's not important right now! ''(Wipes his eyes)'' You are on thin ice, boy! You wanna keep this job? Well, some maniac broke in to the supplies closet last night and destroyed our one and only pool skimmer! I want you on a stakeout. If one more supply gets taken, you're fired!
|-
!Dipper
|I won't let you down!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Mermando at the pool.''
|-
!Mabel
|Mermando, get ready! I'm gonna BRING THE HEAT! ''(Throws the ball to Mermando)''
|-
!
|''Mermando gets hit by the ball sadly.''
|-
!Mabel
|Mermando, are you okay?
|-
!
|''Mermando swims to Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, it's your family, isn't it? Are you thinking about them?
|-
!
|''Mermando makes a dolphin sound''
|-
!Mabel
|Mermando, enough is enough! I care about you too much to see you like this. We're ganna bust you out of here and get you back to your family.
|-
!Mermando
|But Mabel! Escape is impossible.
|-
!Mabel
|We're breaking you out of here tonight!
|-
!
|''Mabel hits the water which splashes.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oops! Sorry about that. Water.
|-
!
|''At night, Dipper guards the pool.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, Dipper, here's the plan. Catch the trespasser, protect the supplies, keep job at pool, and eventually marry Wendy. ''(Dipper hears a sound)'' Freeze!
|-
!
|''Dipper turns to the place where the sound is heard. It turns out to be Stan cutting the fence.''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan?
|-
!Stan
|I-uh, I'm sleep walking! Also now I'm sleep talking. ''(Points at the hat)'' Nice hat, by the way.
|-
!Dipper
|You! You're the one destroying pool supplies!
|-
!
Stan
|What? No! My crime is a lot better than that. I'm gonna get that seat and be ready at the morning when Gideon comes. And maybe I'll destory some pool supplies. Night's still young.
|-
!
|''Dipper blows the whistle.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Backs off)'' Yeesh, alright, I'm goin'!
|-
!
|''Stan walks a little, then runs to the pool.''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! 
|-
!
|''Dipper follows after him. Then, from a bush, Mabel appers in a golfcart. Mermando notices Mabel by the lights.''
|-
!Mermando
|Mabel! ''(Swims to Mabel)''
|-
!
Mabel
|Are you ready to see your family?
|-
!Mermando
|Yes, but how can I, a merman, possibly escape?
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, my original plan was to tape together a bunch fish sticks to make you a prosthetic pair of people legs.
|-
!Mermando
|Intriguing.
|-
!Mabel
|But then I realized that I could just transport you in this cooler.
|-
!
|''(Mermando leaps out of the pool. After a pause, he hops into the cooler.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! Who's there!
|-
!Mermando
|Quick! Hide me! My kind must not be seen!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel? Is there anyone not breaking into the pool tonight? What, is Soos here too?
|-
!Soos
|I'm okay.
|-
!Dipper
|Go home, Soos.
|-
!Soos
|You got it.
|-
!Dipper
|So, why are you here?
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, no reason. ''(Mermando clears his throat)''
|-
!Dipper
|Did that cooler just clear its throat?
|-
!Mabel
|Don't be silly. There certainly isn't a merman in there, if that's what you're implying. Who said anything about a merman?
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, I don't have time for your games. If you don't give me those supplies, I'll lose the coolest job ever!
|-
!Mabel
|I understand. Hey, look! Wendy in a bikini!
|-
!Dipper
|Really? At night?
|-
!Mabel
|Sorry, Dipper!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel!
|-
!Pool Jail kid
|Go, Mabel, go! We can't all be saved.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm gonna get you home!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Through megaphone)''Hand over the pool supplies in the name of pool law!

|''Dipper continues to fire the water balloons at the golf cart. Mabel dodges them.''
|-
!Mabel
|
Look! [[Lake Gravity Falls|Gravity Falls lake]]!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the pool. Stan comes out from the bathroom.''
|-
!Stan
|The coast is clear. Now all I have to do is wait here 15 hours until the pool opens...''(Sits on the chair)'' This was a good plan.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Dipper chasing Mabel.''
|-
!Blubs
|I think someone just sped by.
|-
!Durland
|Probably just a dream.
|-
!Blubs
|With you, every day is a dream.
|-
!
|''Dipper fires another water balloon at the cooler, causing the water to be drenched.''
|-
!Mermando
|I cannot breathe! You must hurry!
|-
!
|''Mabel drives the cart towards the lake, then hits the brakes, causing her to fall off the cart.''
|-
!Mabel
|I'm okay.
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, the jig is up! Hand over that cooler!
|-
!Mabel
|Never!
|-
!Dipper
|Why not? Why do you even need it?
|-
!Mabel
|I needed the cooler to save my new friend because he needs to go home and he's really nice and we combed each others' hair and he needs to be in the cooler because he breathes water because he's a merman!
|-
!Mermando
|''(Mermando rolls out of the cooler)'' Hola.
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Way to bury the lede, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, Mermando the merman. He's a merman.
|-
!Mermando
|Nice to meet you. Also, I think I am dying. ''(Gasps)'' Water! Agua! Yo necesito!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, no! Mermando! Dipper, you're a lifeguard! Give him CPR!
|-
!Dipper
|Mermen don't breathe air!
|-
!Mabel
|Then give him reverse CPR! Doi!
|-
!
|''Dipper runs to the pool car and grabs a bottle of water. He runs back and leans over Mermando and steals himself. He squirts water into his mouth and starts resuscitating Mermando through mouth-to-mouth.''
|-
!Dipper
|I hate this! I hate this!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Takes a photo. Laughs)'' Blackmail!
|-
!Mermando
|Thank you for saving me, But why didn't you just roll me into the lake? ''(Mermando gestures to the lake which is only a foot away.)''
|-
!
|''Dipper smacks his forehead.''
|-
!
|''Cut to the twins helping Mermando into the water.''
|-
!Mermando
|''(Making dolphin sounds, then coughs)'' I am weak from coughing. How will I get my family to hear my call from the mighty depths of the ocean?
|-
!Mabel
|I've got it. BRB. ''(she grabs a megaphone from the golf cart)'' Problem solved!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, those are pool supplies. I'll get fired!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! Don't you know what it's like to fall for someone? Even though you know in your heart that it'll probably never work out, but you'd do anything for that person?
|-
!Dipper
|''(sighs)'' Give Mermando the megaphone.
|-
!Mabel
|Thanks, Dip.
|-
!Mermando
|Mabel, I have never met anyone like you.
|-
!Mabel
|Same here. Except for a zombie, a gnome, and a couple of cute vampires.
|-
!Dipper
|I don't remember the vampires.
|-
!Mabel
|I don't tell you everything. ''(To Mermando)'' Well, Mermando, I guess this is it.
|-
!Mermando
|Not quite. This is! ''(leaps up and kisses Mabel.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Okay, that's gross. Ugh.
|-
!Mabel
|That was my first kiss! Hey, it was also kind of your first kiss too, huh? Huh?
|-
!Dipper
|Please don't involve me in this.
|-
!Mabel
|Goodbye, Mermando.
|-
!Mermando
|Goodbye, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|You did the right thing, Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, yeah.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, wait, wait! One last thing! ''(Runs over to Mermando)'' Yes! I've always wanted to do that.
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|A wrecked fence, dents in the pool mobile, And a missing megaphone? Who is responsible for this?!
|-
!Dipper
|It's my fault, sir. I'm sorry. I got in too deep.
|-
!Mr. Poolcheck
|Hand over the whistle, boy!
|-
!
|''Dipper hands Poolcheck the whistle, who then proceeds to put it in his mouth and crushes it with his teeth. Dipper slowly backs away.''

!Poolcheck
|If one more thing goes wrong today—

|You're free now! Free! Inflatable ducks unite!

|You!

|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|Git 'em! Git 'em!

!
|''Cut to Dipper walking away sadly. Suddenly, a water balloon hits his face.''
|-
!Wendy
|Hey, doofus, you'll never guess what happened. I just got fired.
|-
!Dipper
|What? Really?
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah. I guess Poolcheck found out I was taking too many snacks.
|-
!Dipper
|How many?
|-
!
|''Wendy lifts her hat and reveals a stack of Corncorno packs. Dipper laughs.''
|-
!Wendy
|Hey, wanna go break rules somewhere else?
|-
!Dipper
|Of course!
|-

|''Mabel is sitting by the pool, sighs. Then a bottle pops out from the vents.''
|-
!Mabel
|"Dear Mabel, ''(Mermando's voice plays in the background)'' I am home with my family and I am very happy"
|-
!Mermando
|Our first kiss will always hold a place in my heart. Technically hearts. As a merman I have, like, 17 hearts. Horrifying but true! More bottles on the way!
|-
!
|''Bottles appear and Mabel giggles''
|-
!Gideon
|Stanford! (and Stan laughs) Well, guess you've won. Put 'er there.
|-
!Stan
|Hey! What the—

!Gideon
|Unless perhaps I predicted your plan, and coated the entire chair with glue last night! Enjoy your chair... ''forever''. (and he laughs)

|Mabel, last night an owl tried to eat my tongue.

|Ha ha! That's great!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gets up from his bed) ''No, it's not great! This ''(gestures to their dirty and wrecked room)'' is impossible to live with!

|What? I'm delightful to live with! Get ready to be poked by the fun stick! Boop! ''(Takes a stick and pokes Dipper with it)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah! ''(Slaps it out of Mabel's hand)'' Mabel, I've had it with the fun stick! You've totally wrecked our room. And—''(gasps)''—oh no! Our mini-golf course!
|-
!Mabel
|Heh heh heh, yeah. Grenda sure loves breaking things.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, we need to lay down some ground rules if we're gonna be living in this room together. First of all, no sleepovers.
|-
!Mabel
|What?! Well if I can't have sleepovers, then you can't keep me up every night with your summer reading.
|-
!Dipper
|How does reading keep you up?
|-
!
|''Flashbacks to a night an unknown time ago.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)'' Ooh... heh heh heh... interesting... but who stole the capers? ''(Clicks pen several times)''

!Mabel
|At least I wash my clothes once in a while. ''(Picks up a pair of underwear with the fun stick)''
|-
!Dipper
|Washing clothes is a waste of time, I'm a busy guy!
|-
!Mabel
|Meow meow meow meow meow!
|-
!Dipper
|Alright if you meow one more time—
|-
!Mabel
|Meow meow meow!
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, that's it! That's the final straw! Maybe we shouldn't share a room anymore.
|-
!Mabel
|Wah...uh...well maybe we shouldn't!
|-
!Dipper
|Fine by me!
|-
!Mabel
|Double fine by me!
|-
!Dipper
|Then we need to talk to Grunkle Stan about moving rooms.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah. He's a reasonable guy.

!Stan
|T.V. It knows what I want.
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, we want different rooms.
|-
!Stan
|Ha! And I want a pair of magic money pants. It's not gonna happen.
|-
!Mabel
|Magic money pants...?
|-
!Dipper
|Come on, Grunkle Stan. Can't we work something out?
|-
!Stan
|Look kid, there's my room and the attic. That's it. What do you think, there's some kinda "secret hidden room" in the [[Mystery Shack|Shack]]?
|-
!
|''A very loud crash is heard.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Off screen)'' Dudes! I found some kind of secret hidden room in the Shack!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel grin at each other. Cuts to all of them looking at Soos with a door.''
|-
!Soos
|Okay, so I was cleaning up behind this bookcase when boom! Mystery door! This old Shack is full of weird secrets. ''(Opens door and they all look into it. Dipper and Mabel walk into it and look around)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa-hoh!
|-
!Mabel
|Classy...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks at a calendar)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(blows the dust off a small mirror and she coughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks at the tag on the [[Electron Carpet|shag carpet]].)'' Experiment 78? Grunkle Stan, what is this place?
|-
!Stan
|
I don't know. Just another room I gotta clean up now. ''(Takes a pair of glasses off a table and puts it in his shirt)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Makes snow angels in the carpet)'' This carpet is amazing!
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, if you're into things that are terrible.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sees a key hanging on the wall and grabs it)'' Problem solved, I'll move in here!
|-
!Mabel
|What? Why do you automatically get the room? We both saw it at the same time.
|-
!Stan
|Wait a second. ''(Takes the key from Dipper)'' So you both want this room, huh? I guess I'll give it to whichever one of you I like more. ''(Unties his own shoe)'' Uh oh. Looks like my shoe's untied.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel look at each other for a second before attacking each other trying to tie Stan's shoe.''
|-
!Stan
|Muah ha ha. To the kitchen! Fight, fight, fight!
|-
!
|''Stan runs to the kitchen and Dipper and Mabel let go of his shoe. They get up to follow him out the exit, but Soos blocks the door.''
|-
!Soos
|Whoa! I don't know dudes, this room gives me major, creep-o vibes. Y'know, the attic is a pretty good space. Maybe you two should appreciate what you got.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel look at each other before running past Soos.''
|-
!Soos
|Heh. Hey, what do I know? ''(grabs a broom and starts sweeping)'' Maybe there's nothing creepy going on in this room.
|-
!
|''The camera then shows the carpet's tag that says "Experiment 78," and the tag is crackling with electricity. Cuts to commercial break.''
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel are in the kitchen, elbowing each other.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Holds up key)'' Okay, here's how it's gonna go down. Whoever sucks-up the hardest get's the key to the new room.
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, we're not gonna suck-up to you just to get the new room.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah we are!
|-
!Stan
|Ten suck-up points for Mabel!
|-
!Dipper
|I mean—uh—yeah we are!
|-
!Stan
|Trying too hard. Minus 15 suck-up points.
|-
!Dipper
|What?
|-
!Mabel
|Good decision Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|Trying way too hard! Plus 50 suck-up points!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Expression darkens)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Holds up a bucket filled with tiles)'' Now, who wants to re-tile the roof in searing 105 degree heat?
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Me me! I'll do it!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs up, takes the bucket, and runs outside)''
|-
!Mabel
|No, Dipper, give it here! ''(Chases him)''
|-
!Stan
|He he. Stan, you're a good uncle.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Outside)'' Gimme it!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Outside)'' No!
|-
!Mabel
|It's mine!
|-
!Dipper
|Mine!
|-
!Mabel
|I'll kill you!
|-
!
|''Cuts to Dipper and Mabel mowing the lawn while Stan watches them. Dipper stops for a second to take a break.''
|-
!Stan
|Dipper, you're phoning it in!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Continues mowing)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Drinks lemonade)'' Man, that's refreshing. 10 suck-up points for this lemonade! ''(Pretending to be lemonade)'' Thank you, Stan! ''(Normal voice)'' Oh-ho! 10 more for politeness. ''(Takes a sip)'' Oh, and so sweet!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Opens door to the room; sighs)'' All these chores will be worth it when I get this room. Shag carpeting? Come on! ''(Takes off shoes and begins shuffling feet on the carpet, and electricity builds up around his legs)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey brother. Don't get too comfortable. I just made Stan an omelet shaped like his own face.
|-
!
|''Cuts to Stan looking at his omelet.''
|-
!Stan
|I have seen the face of beauty... ''(Starts eating)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Starts circling Mabel, building up more electricity)''
|-
!Mabel
|Face it. I'm like a suck-up ninja. This room's as good as mine. You might as well give up now. What do you say? ''(Stretches out hand)''
|-
!Dipper
|I say I'm gonna win this room somehow, and when I do I'll finally have my own space... ''(raises hand)''... and we'll never have to share anything ever again!
|-
!
|''Dipper slaps Mabel's hand away, electrocuting Mabel, and causing a huge glow in between them.''
|-
!Both
|Aaaaah!
|-
!
Dipper
|''(Sits up) ''Ugh...what happened?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper? Why are you wearing my clothes...and my...face?! Am I in your body?!

|-
!Mabel
|''(Punching Dipper's stomach)'' Get out, get out, get out!
|-
!Dipper
|''(In the corner)'' This isn't happening, this isn't happening, this isn't happening...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Her shadow is seen on the wall and she screams)''
|-
!
|''Cuts to Dipper and Mabel looking at their new, swapped bodies in the mirror.''
|-
!Dipper
|Great! Just what we need, more [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] weirdness.
|-
!Mabel
|This is stupid! Sharing a room was bad enough, now we're sharing bodies?
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, braces are horrible. It's like my mouth hates me. And what are these things? ''(Pokes Mabel's loose hair)''
|-
!Mabel
|I don't know why you're so sweaty, and awkward.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey look. Experiment 78. ''(Walks over to the tag on the carpet, and turns it around. On the back it says "Electron Carpet")'' Electron Carpet. Atoms can swap electrons. This carpet must build up a static charge so powerful it can swap minds! ''(Starts clicking pen)'' It was the static electricity! Maybe we can use it to switch back!
|-
!Mabel
|Phew, ho ho! Glad I'm switching back. If I was you I would totally lose the contest.
|-
!Dipper
|And if I was you, which I am, I could sabotage myself! Then Mabel would lose all her points and the room would go to Dipper!
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, what?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh Stan! I've always hated you! Ha ha, see who he gives the room to now!
|-
!Mabel
|No! Wait! ''(Begins to chase him but trips)'' Tie your shoes!
|-
!Stan
|''(Finishes eating his omelet)'' Mm! Those cannibals are onto something. I taste delicious!
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|What's the word, Mabel?
|-
!Dipper
|That's right. It's me - ''(tucks hair behind her ear)'' - Mabel. If ya like that omelet you'll love this! A sandwich made out of rocks! ''(Pulls out a rock sandwich and gives it to Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|Candy rocks?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shakes head)'' Regular rocks.
|-
!Stan
|Keep that up and I'll be giving your brother this key.
|-
!Dipper
|Ha ha! I mean, darn.
|-
!Mabel
|Hey Grunkle Stan! Your face looks like a butt!
|-
!Stan
|What?
|-
!Mabel
|Breaking stuff is so much fun, I am Dipper and I stink! ''(Kicks the oven and kicks bottles around)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel's gone bananas! Zing! Zow! Ballow! ''(Pours cereal out of the box everywhere and laughs)''
|-
!Stan
|Well this is gettin' weird. ''(Gets up and walks away)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait! Are you gonna dock Mabel points?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper should lose all his points!
|-
!
|''Mabel starts to chase him, but Dipper tackles her.''

!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan!

!
|''Cuts to Waddles rubbing against the carpet in the room, with Soos vacuuming nearby.''
|-
!Soos
|Waddles, you got it good, bro. You got no worries. I mean, nobody thinks it's cute when I lie naked on the living room floor. I wish I could be a pig. ''(Rubs Waddles' head, the electrons are swapped, and they swap bodies)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Looks around)'' Yes! I should do out loud wishing more often. ''(Sniffs)'' Is that a corn cob I spy? ''(Climbs up the couch and out the window)'' I got little legs.
|-
!
|''Waddles looks around confused, as now he is in Soos' body, and tries to walk out the door. He hits it 3 times before leaving the room. Waddles walks into the gift shop and looks at the vending machine. He licks the glass cover and makes the postcard stand fall. [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] then walks in.''
|-
!Wendy Corduroy
|Hey Soos, what's up? Have you seen my— ''(Looks at Waddles in Soos' body)''
|-
!Waddles
|''(Chews on a t-shirt)''
|-
!Wendy
|Uh, I'll come back later... ''(Leaves the room)''

!

|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, come back! I have more terrible things to do! You're toast, Mabel! That room's as good as mine! ''(Runs off, but crashes into Grenda)''
|-
!Grenda
|There you are, Mabel!
|-
!Candy
|Attack her with love!
|-
!Grenda

!Dipper
|I—I never wanted to move out.
|-
!Mabel
|Then what ''was'' all this?

!Dipper
|Everything was fine until you started bringing your friends around every night. I mean, hanging out with you this summer's been fun. But, now you're always with Candy and Grenda, and I'm... like... just, left behind.

!Mabel
|Aww, Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|It's okay. I've just been having a hard time, you wouldn't understand what I'm going through.

!Mabel
|Move it along, weird old man.

|No! I said we were going to meet Sev'ral Timez tonight, and I meant it! And I'm not going to let a "Keep out" sign, keep us out!
|-
!
|''Cut to the kitchen in the [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
!Stan (singing)
|[[Meat for the Apocalypse|Stockin' meat for the apocalypse, doodly-doo. We're all gonna die.]]
|-
!
|''Dipper walks in, staring down at the CD he's holding and paces up and down the kitchen.''
|-
!Stan
|What's with the pacing, kid? You look even more freaked out than usual.
|-
!Dipper
|Um, I dunno... You wouldn't understand.
|-
!Stan
|Aw, c'mon kid. (''Stan pulls Dipper into a chair)'' Try me.
|-
!Dipper
|Ok. This is gonna sound weird, but I think Robbie might be brainwashing Wendy with music.
|-
!Stan
|I've seen this before.
|-
!Dipper
|Really?
|-
!Stan
|Her name was [[Carla McCorkle]]. Carla "Hotpants" McCorkle.
|-
!
|''Stan turns his head and the shot fades to a young Stan Pines leaning against a juke box, nodding his head to the music.''
|-
!Stan (Narrating)
|Me and Carla baby would cut a rug together at [[The Juke Joint]], our favorite 50's themed, 1970's diner.
|-
!
|''Young Stan and Carla embrace before the two start dancing happily together.''
|-
!Stan (Narrating)
|Then one day, this new age tree hugger starts playing this transcendental hippie music.
|-
!
|''Young Stan dances by himself and turns to see Carla and [[Thistle Downe]] holding each other. He stares at them in shock.''
|-
!Stan (Narrating)
|(''Sighs)'' Carla's hotpants turned into bellbottoms before I even knew what happened.
|-
!
|''The camera pans down the new couple and Carla's hotpants literally turn into bellbottoms. They then shoot up out of screen leaving behind a trail of rainbows and sparkles. Young Stan looks down forlorn and it fades back to current Stan still looking sad.''
|-
!Stan
|My memories get a little hallucination-y at the end, but you get the gist.
|-
!Dipper
|So, wait... you actually believe my theory?
|-
!Stan
|You're darn right I do. And we're gonna get to the bottom of it.
|-
!
|''Dipper smiles, encouraged.''
|-
!Stan
|Right after I get to the bottom of this brown meat.
|-
!
|''Stan upturns the can of meat he was holding and hits the back of the can so the meat falls in his mouth.''
|-
!Stan
|Om, nom, it's apocolicious!
|-
!
|''Cut to the Sev'ral Timez concert which is coming to an end. The band is dancing on stage.''
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|Sev'ral Timez!
|-
!
|''The crowd screams. Deep Chris is sitting on a stool holding a mike.''
|-
!Deep Chris
|Hey, girl. I just wanna get real for a moment. And say that while we love being superstars, the real reason we do this... is for you. For you specifically. Not the girl sitting next to you. But ''you''.
|-
!Brunette of [[Pacifica's friends]]
|I love you Deep Chris!
|-
!Redhead of Pacifica's friends
|He was talking to me!
|-
!
|''The redhead throws a chair at the brunette and soon a whole crowd jumps into fighting.''
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|Get 'em! Get 'em!
|-
!Creggy G.
|Thank you, good night!
|-
!
|''Cuts to a bunch of girls screaming as they leave the concert past the back stage door of the Civic Center. The door's lock has been picked with a hair clip.''
|-
!Grenda
|Hello! Sev'ral Timez?
|-
!Candy
|We want to give you several kisses!
|-
!Mabel
|Look! (''points)''
|-
!
|''The three run up the Sev'ral Timez's dressing room door.''
|-
!Mabel
|This is it, girls. You're finally going to meet the five cutest boys in the world! Dipper's gonna eat his words that boy bands are "fake." (''Takes deep breath and opens door'')
|-
!
|''The girls gasp at the sight of several cloning tubes of the band in several stages of thier biological development. Starting with their current teenaged age to a fetus. The girls turn and see the band in a giant hamster cage.''
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Yo, we're clones, dawg!
|-
!Grenda
|O.
|-
!Candy
|M.
|-
!Mabel
|G.
|-
!Mabel
|That is one big hamster tube. (''Gasps)'' Someone's coming!
|-
!
|''The three hide behind a rack of clothes as a man walks in imposingly.''
|-
![[Ergman Bratsman]]
|Terrible show! What is wrong with you boys? You barely even sold out the arena! And Deep Chris, you call that a pout?
|-
!
|''Deep Chris pouts and whimpers like a puppy; his bottom lip trembling.''
|-
!Bratsman
|Every one of you should be ashamed of yourselves! Except you, Leggy P. You were really on point tonight. Here ya go, gorgeous.
|-
!
|''Bratsman throws Leggy P. a giant hamster treat. He nibbles on it and hisses when Deep Chris reaches for it.''
|-
!Bratsman
|As for the rest of you. Remember you can always be replaced by your ''brothers''.
|-
!
|''Bratsman indicates to the cloning tubes and the one that looks like a preteen dances at Bratsman's cue.''
|-
!Bratsman
|Dance for me child! DANCE! (''Bratsman laughs and chokes maniacally)'' Augh, my throat is killin' me. Can someone get me a lemon water?
|-
!
|''He slams the door shut as he leaves, which forces the girls to fall out of their hiding place.''
|-
!Deep Chris
|Who goes there? Prepare to be danced at!
|-
!
|''Deep Chris starts dancing towards the edge of the cage where Mabel stares wide eyed from the floor. Creggy G. crouches in front of Deep Chris, blocking him from Mabel.''
|-
!Creggy G.
|Step off, Deep Chris. She's a lady. Don't disrespect her, bro. Don't disrespect.
|-
!Deep Chris
|My bad.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Squeals)''
|-
!Deep Chris
|Chubby Z., let's calm this boo-bop, posing for her poster style.
|-
!
|''The band pose for her.''
|-
!Mabel
|(''Lets out a small scream)'' Trying not to let my brain explode. I've always wanted to meet you guys! But what was the deal with that scary chub-chub man?
|-
!Deep Chris
|Mr. Bratsman's our producer yo.
|-
!Creggy G.
|He genetically engineered us to be the perfect boy band, G.
|-
!Chubby Z.
|But he keeps us in cages! That junk is straight brutal, girl!
|-
!Mabel
|That is straight brutal, Chubby Z.
|-
!Creggy Z.
|Our one dream is to escape into the ''real world''. For real. Yo, I heard 'bout these things called "trees." I dunno what they are, but I wanna kiss one!
|-
!Greggy C.
|But we can't disobey Mr. Bratsman. He says he loves us.
|-
!Mabel
|If he loved you, he'd set you free!
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|(''Nodding)'' True dat, true dat.
|-
!Chubby Z.
|That's a valid perspective!
|-
!Mabel
|(''Picks lock)'' Let's go right now. Me and my friends can help you escape!
|-
!Grenda
|We're masters of STEALTH!
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Yo, you'd really do that for us, beef?
|-
!Mabel
|You can count on me! ''(Pause)'' I'm sorry, did you just call me "beef"?
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Stan
|Y'see, Dipper, music has sublimnal mind control hidden in it all the time. If you listen closely, even the music I play in the Gift Shop has subtle hidden messages.
|-
!
|''Cut to two [[tourists]] browsing the Gift Shop.''
|-
!Speaker
|BUY MORE KEYCHAINS! BUY MORE KEYCHAINS!
|-
!
|''One tourist runs away after knocking down postcards. The other collapses onto the floor after dropping a jarred hand, and whimpers as he presses his hands over his ears. Cut back to Stan and Dipper.''
|-
!Stan
|If you wanna hear the mind controlling messages, you gotta slow down the record. Gimme that LP.
|-
!
|''Stan grabs the CD from Dipper and puts it on a record player. It just scratches the CD which discharges little sparks of electricity.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, right.
|-
!Stan
|We're doin' something wrong here, but I can't put my finger on it...
|-
!
|''Mabel, Grenda, and Candy are shoving a large sports bag into the Shack. Mabel groans with the effort.''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, guys. How was the concert, and what's in the bag?
|-
!Mabel
|Uh... money! Money we stole!
|-
!Candy
|We are criminals! We will cut you!
|-
!Mabel
|Let's go away from here now!
|-
!
|''The girls pull and shove the bag up the stairs and the band members inside the bag yelp at every other step. Dipper and Stan watch them and look at each other questioningly.''
|-
!
|''Cut to the the inside of the bag getting unzipped. In Mabel and Dipper's room the Sev'ral Timez members fall out one at a time. Deep Chris comes out in a pose.''
|-
!Leggy P.
|Your tour bus is really strange, Mabel girl. Where the feedin' tubes at?
|-
!
|''The members inspect the room. Deep Chris pats Waddles on its head.''
|-
!Deep Chris
|Yo what up, girl? (''Waddles oinks)''
|-
!
|''The girls giggle and share secretive smiles with each other.''
|-
!Creggy G.
|So, when do we get to go outside?
|-
!Chubby Z.
|I wanna cavort like a woodland creature!
|-
!
|''A car screeches outside. Mabel runs to the window.''
|-
!Mabel
|(''Gasps)'' It's your producer!
|-
!
|''The band members panic and jump under Mabel's bed. Outside, Bratsman exits his limousine.''
|-
!Bratsman
|I can't believe those boys escaped from their cage. You there! I found this trail of frosted tips leading to this'' very location''. Have you seen any perfect boys around here?
|-
![[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]
|Only when I look in the mirror. Haha, up top!
|-
!
|''Soos raises his hand for a high five, but Bratsman just stares at him. Eventually he high fives himself.''
|-
!Bratsman
|They must be around here somewhere! I'll find those boys if I have to turn this town upside down!
|-
!
|''[[Gompers]] bleats as he chews off Bratsman's license plate.''
|-
!Bratsman
|Shoo! Shoo! Ehh...
|-
!
|''Bratsman enters his limousine and leaves, glaring at Soos suspiciously as he does so.''
|-
!Soos
|(''To Gompers)'' Good boy.
|-
!Mabel
|Guys, it's not safe out there! Ergman's still looking for you!
|-
!Chubby Z.
|What do we do?
|-
!Deep Chris
|Aw dang!
|-
!Greggy C.
|I'm scared, Mabel!
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry, guys. He has to give up eventually. Hey... in the meantime you guys can stay here with us!
|-
!
|''The band members exclaim happily.''
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Aw right, twenty-thirteen!
|-
!Mabel
|Girls, do you realize what's happening here? We have our very own pet boy band that we can do whatever we want with!
|-
!Candy
|Remember, eventually we will have to let them go. We have to promise not to get too attached to them. Right, Mabel? Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|All aboard the braid train! Braid braid!
|-
!
|''Candy and Grenda look at Mabel and Sev'ral Timez line of braiding hair a little worriedly.''
|-
!Mabel
|What?
|-
!
|''Cut to a montage of the girls hanging out with the band. A [[It'll Be This Way Forever|song]] sung by Sev'ral Timez plays over it. The band performing for the girls in the living room and hiding on the ceiling when Stan nearly catches them, teaching them to drink water normally, the girls racing on the band members in a long hallway. The montage ends with a Sev'ral Timez group hug and Mabel. Grenda and Candy try to join in as well.''
|-
!Mabel
|Just—oh— just a few more minutes.
|-
!Grenda
|But--
|-
!Mabel
|(''Hisses)''
|-
!
|''Grenda and Candy look at each other, startled.''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Stan in the living room. Dipper has just finished converting the CD to a record.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, it took all day but I converted it to a record. And now we can slow it down to see if the mind control message theory is correct. Prepare to have your mind blown.
|-
!Stan
|Spit-take here I come. (''Sips [[Pitt Cola]])''
|-
!
|''The record plays and Dipper slows it down, a tapeman at the ready to record any hidden messages. ''
|-
!Stan
|Hm... that's not spit worthy. What gives?
|-
!Dipper
|What? Is that it?
|-
!
|''Dipper messes with the speed to no avail.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh! This was so stupid! Course there's no hidden mind control messages! Mabel was right. Wendy just likes the song. She just likes Robbie.
|-
!
|''Wendy and Robbie enter.''
|-
!Wendy
|Hey, Dip. Forgot my keys. (''leaves)''
|-
!Robbie
|What's up, junior. What are you doing? Trying to come up with an equation to make girls like you? (''laughs)''
|-
!Wendy
|(''enters)'' Ready to go to look out point?
|-
!Robbie
|Am I! Later, dorks. Catch ya on the rewind. (''chuckles)'' I made that up.
|-
!
|''Robbie and Wendy leave.''
|-
!Stan
|(''shakes fist)'' I'll rewind your face!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait a minute. Stan, rewind!
|-
!
|''Dipper manual turns the record backwards and this time another message can be heard.''
|-
!Record
|You are under my control. Your mind is mine.
|-
!Stan
|(''spits soda onto Dipper's face)'' Holy mackerel! Now there's your spit-take!
|-
!Dipper
|Ha ha! I knew it! It's mind control after all! Oh no, I've got to save Wendy!
|-
!Stan
|Finally, a good reason to punch a teenager in the face. Let's roll!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Stan exit the back door. Mabel walks down the stairs and into the kitchen where Grenda and Candy are watching TV. ''
|-
!Grenda
|How'd it go up there?
|-
!Mabel
|(''sighs)'' Oh, I finally got them to sleep. Poor Greggy C. He tried to eat a tape dispenser.
|-
!
|''Cut to Greggy C.''
|-
!Greggy C.
|I think this is food, dog! (''stuffs dispenser into mouth and starts choking on it.)''
|-
!Creggy G.
|Yo, you gonna share that?
|-
!
|''Cut back to the kitchen.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah, memories.
|-
!
[[Shandra Jimenez]]
(On TV)
|The music industry was shaken today at the news that boy band king, Ergman Bratsman, has been arrested. He was pulled over tonight for not having a rear license plate.
|-
!Bratsman
|I'm telling ya, the goat took it!
|-
![[Sheriff Blubs]]
|That's what they all say.
|-
!Shandra
|He is now in county jail, awaiting trial.
|-
!Grenda
|Yes!
|-
!Candy
|We have to tell the boys they are free now.
|-
!Mabel
|''(laughs nervously)''
|-
!Candy
|Let's go!
|-
!
|''Grenda and Candy giggle happily as they run up the stairs to the attic. Mabel runs to block them from the bedroom door.''
|-
!Mabel
|Not so fast! They're not going anywhere.
|-
!Grenda and Candy
|(''gasps)''
|-
!Grenda
|What's the dealio, Mabel? That evil producer is gone. We have to tell the boys.
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, girls. Let's not be so hasty. I mean, think about it. If we don't tell the boys, then they can stay here with me—I mean, with us.
|-
!Grenda
|Mabel, we can't keep them here forever.
|-
!Mabel
|But I love them!
|-
!Candy
|If you loved them, you'd set them free.
|-
!Mabel
|Never! Every boy I've loved this summer has left me! And I'm not gonna let it happen again!
|-
!Grenda
|Candy, we gotta get past Mabel. She's gone boy crazy!
|-
!Mabel
|''(huffs, teeth bared) BOYS''.
|-
!Candy
|Candy, attack!
|-
!
|''Candy tackles Mabel through the door. The band stand up, startled.''
|-
!Grenda
|You guys, Ergman Bratsman is in jail! You're free!
|-
!Candy
|Just go!
|-
!Creggy G.
|Woah! Is that true, Mabel dog?
|-
!Mabel
|Uhh, no! Your producer's still out there! You're gonna have to stay here, probably forever!
|-
!Grenda
|What! You can't listen to her!
|-
!Deep Chris
|Mabel's our girl, girl. She puts pizza in our food trough!
|-
!Chubby Z.
|She changes my newspaper, yo. She's aight.
|-
!Grenda
|She is not "aight," Chubby Z!
|-
!
|''Mabel pulls herself up from under Candy and marches up to the band members.''
|-
!Mabel
|Sev'ral Timez!
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|Yes, Mabel dog?
|-
!Mabel
|Remove these two from the premises, please.
|-
!
|''Sev'ral Times move toward them snapping thier fingers at them.''
|-
!Grenda
|Oh no, they're aggressively dancing at us!
|-
!
|''They pick up Candy and Grenda''.
|-
!Grenda
|Mabel's gone mad with power. Save yourselves, Sev'ral Timez! You were better off with your producer!
|-
!
|''They throw the two out the room.'' And turn and pose.
|-
!Deep Chris
|Word.
|-
!Grenda
|(''peeks her head back in)'' Call me Deep Chris! (''Leggy P. kick the door back close.)''
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Twenty-thirteen!
|-
!Mabel
|(''sighs)'' Thank you, boys. Now let's get aboard the braid train.
|-
!Deep Chris
|Things just got pretty heavy, Mabel. Maybe we should just like, chill for a minute and--
|-
!Mabel
|I said, let's get aboard THE BRAID TRAIN!
|-
!
|''Sev'ral Timez looks at each other worriedly.''
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Stanmobile]] driving quickly down a road. ''
|-
!Dipper
|We gotta warn Wendy about the song before she get's brainwashed!
|-
!Stan
|Road safety laws, prepare to get ignored! (''Stan drives through a blocked road)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Wendy and Robbie at Lookout Point.''
|-
!Robbie
|Huh, weird, Nate didn't show up. So I- I guess it's just you and me. This isn't what I was planning at all.
|-
!
|''The Stanmobile drives straight up the cliff edge to Lookout Point. Dipper runs out while Stan falls out.''
|-
!Stan
|Wha-o! Oof.
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy!? Stop! Robbie's been lying to you!
|-
!Wendy
|Dipper?
|-
!Robbie
|Kid? Mr. Pines?
|-
!Stan
|That's ''Mr. Pines'' to you!
|-
!Robbie
|What? That's what I just said...
|-
!Dipper
|Look, Wendy, you've got to hear this.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel relaxing on bed drink chocolate milk. Sev'ral Timez walks up to her.''
|-
!Creggy G.
|Mabel, you've got to hear this. It's a song we wrote to say 'thank you.'
|-
!Greggy C.
|Hit it!
|-
!
|''The [[Mabel Girl|song]] starts to play to Mabel's delight.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, boy! Songs are like hugs that mouths give to ears!
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|Here comes you/Mabel girl/We dreamed of being free, (so free)/But now we know/That that can never be/You know what friends are all about/You kicked those lying shorties out, (kick them out y'all)
|-
!Mabel
|Starting to feel guilty here...
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|Break it down!/Who's the girl who's so aight/Tucks us into bed at night/Holds the fan up while we sing/Keeps me entertained with string!/My shirt was wrinkled till/SHE PRESSED IT/Chews our food/SO WE CAN DIGEST IT/He was evil, mean, and reckless/YOU GAVE ME THIS CANDY NECKLACE/'Sup, girl/Other folks we could never trust/But we know/That you'd never lie to us/Mabel girl/We know you love us SoOoOo
|-
!Mabel
|And that's why I've got to let you go. (''sighs)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to Lookout Point. The tapeman is playing a regular recording of Robbie's song.''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh... There's a message in there. (''laughs nervously)'' I swear!
|-
!Robbie
|Let me just... close the window.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, wait! Here. (''Raises the volume)''
|-
!Recording
|You are under my control. Your mind is mine.
|-
!Wendy
|Woah. Robbie, what's that doing in our song?
|-
!Robbie
|Baby, I promise. I don't know anything about those messages. In fact, I didn't even write that song. I ripped it off some other band! So, we're all good, right?
|-
!Wendy
|No, we're not all good! I don't care about the messages. You said you wrote that song for me, and I actually thought it was sweet, you big liar.
|-
!Robbie
|I know, I know. I lie about a lot of stuff. Like using your makeup and fighting a bear, although--
|-
!Wendy
|No! You know what? It's over, Robbie. We're through!
|-
!Robbie
|What?! Wendy!
|-
!Wendy
|Goodbye! (''Wendy gets out and slams the [[Robbie's van|van]] door.)''
|-
!Stan
|Haha! We won! Kid, this is a victory for every guy whose hands are too weak or fat to play a musical instrument.
|-
!Dipper
|I couldn't have done it without you, Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Dipper and Stan
|''(high fives)'' Ha!
|-
!Dipper
|''(runs up to Wendy)'' Um, hey! Uh, now that your night is free, me and Grunkle Stan are thinking, maybe bowling, or something?
|-
!Wendy
|(Crying) Are you serious?! Right now? Ugh! What is ''wrong ''with guys? You only think about yourselves! All of you should just leave me alone! (''leaves)''
|-
!Robbie
|Oh, man. (''buries face into stearing wheel)''
|-
!Stan
|Look, if it makes you feel any better, the apocalypse is coming soon. Bury your gold! ...You've been buying gold, right?
|-
!
|''Dipper looks at his tape forlornly and ashamed.''
|-
!
|''Cut to outside the Mystery Shack. Candy and Grenda walk up to the main entrance.''
|-
!Grenda
|We've gotta save the boys.
|-
!Candy
|I'm prepared to defend myself.
|-
!Mabel
|(''opens door)'' Hi, guys. I'm sorry I went bonkers. A catchy song made me realize, that you were right. Can you ever forgive me?
|-
!Grenda
|Of course!
|-
!Candy
|Friendship, repaired.
|-
!
|''The three hug. Sev'ral Timez exit the Shack.''
|-
!Leggy P.
|What's going on, Mabel girl?
|-
!Chubby Z.
|You said you had something you wanted to show us or some deal?
|-
!Mabel
|Yup. This! (''gestures to outside and rising sun.)''
|-
!
|''The band gasps to varying degrees.''
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Yo, dog who is this big, round, bright, fool?
|-
!Mabel
|That, Chubby Z., is the sun.
|-
!Chubby Z.
|That fool is makin' my eyes hurt straight painful! I'm gonna stare that fool down! (''stares at the sun till his eyes water.)'' Aaauuugh! (''rubs his eyes)''
|-
!Deep Chris
|Yo, yo, hold up. What's this big green mess?
|-
!Mabel
|That's nature, Deep Chris. Bratsman won't bother you anymore. You can do anything you wanna do, go anywhere you wanna go. You're free!
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Fa-ree?
|-
!Mabel
|Free! You're free! It means you can skedaddle! (''sobs and picks up a stick and hits their leg)'' Now go! Go!
|-
!
|''They hesitantly walk forward and turn to look back at Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|Get out of here before I change my mind!
|-
!
|''They walk toward the bushes and sing a final refrain before disappearing into them.''
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|''(Singing)'' Goodbye girl.
|-
!Candy
|They won't last a week.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan and Dipper sitting in the living room.''
|-
!Stan
|Women. They're the real mystery, Dip. You ruin their date, drive their hippie boyfriend's van into a ravine... and somehow you're the "bad guy."
|-
!Dipper
|No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have meddled in Wendy's personal life. She probably hates me now.
|-
!Stan
|Ah, chin up, kid. You were tryin' to do the right thing. Even though you destroyed a relationship and part of my car.
|-
!Dipper
|You think she'll ever forgive me?
|-
!Stan
|Ah, I bet she will. And until then, you can always go bowling with me.
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks, Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Stan
|Don't mention it, kid.
|-
!
|''Stan hears a gnawing sound coming from outside.''
|-
!Stan
|Wait a second... Is something rooting through our trash?
|-
!
|''Outside Leggy P. is digging through a trashcan.''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, hey! Get outta of here!
|-
!
|''Leggy P. scared, runs away on all fours. ''
|-
!Stan
|Darn beautiful men, always eating out of my trash... Wait, what?
|-
!
|''Credits roll.''
|-
!Sev'ral Timez
|Girl you got me actin' so cray cray/CRAY CRAY/You tell me that you won't be my ba-bay/We're non-threatening girl/yeah

!Stan
|It- it took him.

|Took what?

|Well, see, uh, when the uh-
|-
!Soos
|Your pig got eaten by a pterodactyl, bro!
|-
!Mabel
|What!? Waddles? Waddles! Oh no, how did this happen? Grunkle Stan, you didn't put him outside?...
|-
!Stan
|What? No! I didn't put him anywhere! I'm not acting suspicious! YOU'RE acting suspicious. What's a pig?
|-
!Dipper
|Then... what happened?
|-
!Stan
|Uh, look, it went down like this, see? So there I was, in the living room...
|-
!
|''Crossfade to fantasy sequence where Stan is lovingly caring for Waddles''

|... tenderly nursing him on only the richest of creams. When all of a sudden-

!
|''Pterodactyl bursts through the door and roars. It grabs Waddles out of Stan's arms.''
|-
!Stan
|So I said, (''imagining growing huge muscles and tearing off his shirt'') "No dice, cowboy!" And I started punching him right in the face! But he played dirty...
|-
!
|(''Pterodactyl pokes Stan in the eyes'')
|-
!Stan
|That really happened! (''in his imagination'') Why? Why couldn't you have taken me!?' (''starts crying'')

|-
!Mabel
|Oh, Grunkle Stan, you tried to save him! (''gives Stan a hug'')
|-
!Stan
|Uh, yeah! I'm a great man, alright.
|-
!Dipper
|You punched the pterodactyl in the face? I thought you didn't even believe in the supernatural.
|-
!Stan
|Dinosaurs aren't magic, they're just big lizards! Get off my back.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, Waddles.
|-
!Dipper
|That's it. No pterodactyl is gonna messes with MY sister. We're gonna go out there, catch him, and save your pig! For Mabel, guys!
|-
!Soos
|For Mabel!
|-
!Stan
|But how do we even find the little guy?
|-
!Mabel
|(gasps) We follow that! (''points to the yarn trail from Waddles' sweater'')
|-
!Dipper & Soos
|Yes! Yeah! That's genius!
|-
!Stan
|Or, you know, we could just call it a day, maybe hit the pool haul, or- (''stops as everyone stares at him'') Yeah! Let's go... save Woggles!

|Waddles.
|-
!Stan
|Him too.

|''Cuts to Soos spraypainting the words PTERODACTYL MOBILE on the side of a [[Soos' pick-up truck|pickup truck]]''

!Soos
|All right! That p-terodactyl (''pronounces the p'') won't know what hit him!
|-
!Dipper
|Ha! It's pterodactyl.
|-
!Soos
|Actually, no one knows how to pronounce it because nobody was alive back in dinosaur days, so uh... (''straps cage to truck and nearly gets run over'') Whoa! Almost ran over my own head there! (''Laughs'') Wow.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel. We've got to talk. This is a really high-stakes mission and I'm a little worried about Soos coming along on this one. I love the guy, but sometimes he messes stuff up.

|What? Since when?

|-
!Dipper
|Soos, look. I, uh, I've gotta tell you something.
|-
!Soos
|Okay. But before you do, check out these matching shirts I made for us! (''points to shirt'') Who's this guy right here? You! Totally you, dude. And these rays indicate friendship! What was it you were going to tell me again?

!Soos
|Uh, dudes... ''(points to a velociraptor that has worked one single claw out of the sap and is slowly working on a hand)''
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe... we should keep moving.

!Stan
|This could be a gold mine! Velvety-rope type deal there, ticket booth here, ha! I should have put that pig outside ages ago!

!Mabel
|Wait- what did you just say?
|-
!Stan
|Hm? What's that?

|No! Wait, uh, if you think about it-

!Mabel
|You put Waddles outside, then you lied to me about it! (Crying) And now thanks to you, my pig could be dead! WADDLES COULD BE DEAD!

!Waddles
|''(gives Stan a cute look)''
|-
!Stan
|What are you looking at? ''(looks at Waddles sideways as Waddles again blinks at him)'' Aw come on, don't give me that look! What am I supposed to do, let it eat me?
|-
!Waddles
|''(stares at him)''
|-
!Stan
|Argh! Oh, I get it. You're trying to guilt me. Well it ain't working, pal. Who cares if you're Mabel's favorite thing in the world? I can live without the kid talking to me all the time!... Telling me her jokes... makin' me laugh...
|-
!Waddles
|''(snorts and cocks head)''
|-
!Stan
|''(laughs, then notices the pterodactyl swooping down towards them) ''Aw! Dang it! ''(puts Waddles in the Huggy Wuvvy Tummy Bundle)'' Well, this is just about the dumbest thing I've ever done. ''(to the pterodactyl)'' YOU WANT THIS PIG?!
|-
!Waddles
|WHOONK!
|-
!Stan
|THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THROUGH ME, YOU FLYING DEVIL! COME AND GET ME!
|-
!
|''(slow-mo of Stan leaping at the pterodactyl. Cuts back to the baby pterodactyl)''
|-
!Soos
|Ah dude! Did he really just eat that prospecter guy? That is messed up!
|-
!
|''The baby pterodactyl spits out McGucket's hat. Then old man McGucket comes up from the pterodactyl's neck and peeks out from the mouth.''
|-
!Old man McGucket
|I'm okay!
|-
!
|''The baby pterodactyl swallows McGucket again. Mabel, Dipper and Soos backs off.''
|-
!Dipper
|What do we do, what do we do!
|-
!Soos
|We have to get in a straight line.
|-
!Dipper
|What?
|-
!Soos
|The pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart, that if you stand right in front of it, it can't see you!
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, you've been wrong about stuff all day. How can we-
|-
!Soos
|Dude, look. I-I know I've messed up a lot. I could be sort of clumsy and.. It's not always as loveable as I think. But please, as my friend, just trust me on this one! 
|-
!
|''Dipper looks at the baby pterodactyl and looks at Soos. Dipper gives a smile and nods at Soos.''
|-
!Soos
|Get behind me, dudes!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel stands behind Soos. They move quietly. When the pterodactyl looks at them, they make a straight line. In the pterodactyl's eyes, they are out of it's vision.''
|-
!Mabel
|It's working!
|-
!
|''They walk on the track, making a line. when the pterodactyl turns it's head, they jump to the other line of the track. After they complete their crossing, the pterodactyl turns it's attention to eating stuff. The Pines twins and Soos rests behind the rocks. They all sigh.''
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, you did it!
|-
!
|''A cry of a pterodactyl is heard.''
|-
!All
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Looking up, a pterodactyl is flying around and a punching sound is heard.''
|-
!
Dipper
|Was that..?
|-
!Mabel
|Stan?
|-
!
|''Close-up to the pterodactyl. Stan is punching it in is face in slow-mo. Mabel finds Waddles.''
|-
!Mabel
|Waddles!
|-
!Dipper
|He's punching him in the face!
|-
!Stan
|From heck's heart I stabeth thee!! ''(Stabs at the pterodactyl)''
|-
!
|''The pterodactyl hits the cliff, crashes to the ground and Stan climbs up the cliff.''
|-
!Soos and Dipper
|''(Cheers at Stan)''
|-
!
|''Mabel stares at Stan delightly with Stan's hat.''
|-
!Stan
|Here's your pig, kido.'' (Makes Waddles to wave to Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|Waddles! ''(Stan gives Waddles to Mabel. Mabel hugs Waddles)'' You saved him for me!
|-
!Stan
|''(Takes the hat)'' Yeah, well. ''(Behind him, the pterodactyl is climbing up)'' Some times you just gotta.. LOOK OUT!
|-
!
|''They all start to run. The pterodactyl snaps at Dipper and ripped his vest. Back at the entrance, they discover the rope to climb up was cut.''
|-
!Stan
|We're trapped!
|-
!
|''Dipper sees the geyser pushing the rock up.''
|-
!Dipper
|Quick! The geyser could shoot us back up!
|-
!
|''They all climb in the geyser and the pterodactyl is approaching, but the geyser won't pump.''
|-
!Dipper
|C'mon.. Go, go!
|-
!
|''The pterodactyl roars and everyone screams.''
|-
!Soos
|Bros before dinos!'' (Hits the geyser hard)''
|-
!
|''The geyser pumps them up and they land into the buliding all wet. The building collapses and covers the hole. Cuts to the Pines leaving the building.''
|-
!Mabel
|I can't believe you did all that for Waddles!
|-
!Stan
|Ah, well. I can't have my favorite niece not talking to me. ''(Leans on a tree with sap on it)'' And if I gotta leap onto a pterodactyl and punch him in the face, then that's what I gotta do.
|-
!Mabel
|That's kinda sappy.
|-
!Stan
|W-what? That's how I feel!
|-
!Mabel
|No, I mean.. ''(Points Stan's hand)''
|-
!Stan
|Oh, yeah.'' (Touches Mabel's face with the hand has sap on it) ''Gotcha! Ha ha ha ha. ''(Realies it doesn't fall off)'' Uh-oh.'' (Tries to put his hand off from Mabel. They both scream)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the car. At the back seat, Mabel, Waddles and Stan are sleeping. Zoom out to the front seat, which Dipper and Soos are sitting.''
|-
!Dipper
|Check it out! ''(Holds his vest up. it has a hole) ''That thing destroyed my vest! ''(Discovers pterodactyl's tooth stuck in it)'' Soos, look! 
|-
! Soos
|A real dinosaur tooth? That's awesome!
|-
!Dipper
|Not as awesome as you saving us back there. Pterodactyl bros?
|-
!Soos
|Pterodactyl bros. ''(The two fist bump) ''Whoosh! Hey! I pronounced it right that time!
|-
!Dipper
|Think we need to worry about the rest of those dinosaurs?
|-
!Soos
|I doubt it.
|-
!
|''The camera pans back to the house. From the hole, old man McGucket pops out.''
|-
!McGucket
|I ate my way through a dino-sour! ''(Laughs and plays his musical spoon)''
|-
!
|''Cuts to credits. Dipper and Soos are watching tv. ''
|-
!Bobby Renzobbi
|Hey, I'm Bobby Renzobbi. Are your arms jealous of your legs? Then you need "Arm Pants!" The pants that you wear on your arms!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeesh. Who actually buys these informercial stuff?
|-
!Soos
|I know, right? ''(Turns to the phone) ''Cancel the order, cancel the order!
|-
!
|''The camera turns to Mabel, Waddles and Stan. They are playing poker.''
|-
!Waddles
|''(Oinks)''

!Stan
|Snorting! That's his tell! I fold.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Stands up) ''Tough luck, sucker! Waddles was bluffing.

!Stan
|What? I had 4 aces! That pig is a wizard!
|-
!
|''Waddles eats his cards.''

|Li'l Gideon!
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, Gideon!
|-
!Mabel
|Remember when [[The Hand That Rocks the Mabel|I wouldn't date him and he tried to destroy us]]?
|-
!Stan
|He's always trying to trick me into losing the Mystery Shack.
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|One time I caught him stealing my moisturizer.
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|And yet, our mutual hatred for him bonds us together.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Laughs)''
|-
!Bud
|''(On television, voice-over)'' Come on down to Li'l Gideon's Tent of Telepathy, opening soon at this location.
|-
!
|''Commercial shows the Tent of Telepathy crushing the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, should we be worried about that?
|-
!Stan
|Please, the only way Gideon's taking over this shack is by breaking in and stealing my [[Mystery Shack deed|deed]].

!

|38? 41? Oh, heavens to Betsy!
|-
!Stan
|Gideon!
|-
!Gideon
|Well, well, Stanford, my arch-nemesis. We seem to have entered a dangerous game of cat and mouse. But the question remains, who is the cat, and who is the-
|-
!Stan
|Soos, broom.
|-
!Gideon
|Oh no, not the broom!
|-
!Stan
|''(Chases Gideon around the room with the broom)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Hisses)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Hits Gideon with the broom twice before chasing him outside)''
|-
!Gideon
|You mark my words, Stanford, one day I'm gonna get that combination. And once I steal that deed, you'll never see the Mystery Shack again!
|-
!Stan
|Good luck, bucko!
|-
!
|''Close up of Gideon looking angry.''
|-
!
|''Cuts to Stan putting the Mystery Shack deed in his safe and pressing the lock button.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs)'' The combo to this safe is in the one place he'll never find it: my brain. ''(Walks away)''
|-
!Gideon
|Your brain isn't as safe as you might think, Stanford Pines! (''Pulls out [[Journal 2]]'') This is the last straw! It's time to unlock the journal's greatest secret...

|-
!''[[Grandpa the Kid]]''
|''(On television)'' I'm tired during the day.
|-
!Stan
|I can relate to this.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, why can't we watch a movie that we'll all enjoy? ''[[Dream Boy High]]''! "Where love is on your permanent record."
|-
!Stan, Dipper and Wendy
|Boo!
|-
!Mabel
|You'll learn to like it.
|-
!
|''A crash is heard from the kitchen.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Runs into the room)'' Aaah! Dudes, there's a bat in the kitchen! It tried to touch me with its "weird little bat fingers!"
|-
!Stan
|Don't worry, I got this under control ''(Leans back in armchair)'' Dipper, take care of it.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs)'' Yes!
|-
!Dipper
|What? Why can't Mabel do it?
|-
!Stan
|'Cause life ain't fair. Now go fight a bat so we can watch TV.
|-
!Dipper
|No way, Grunkle Stan! You always make me do dumb chores. I'm putting my foot down this time! ''(Stamps foot on carpet)''
|-
!Stan
|I said do it kid. Now!

!Dipper
|Okay, I'll do it! ''(Sighs; walks into kitchen, Mabel following behind him)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks up a saucepan and spoon on the floor, mumbling)'' Stupid chores...
|-
!Mabel
|Remember, bats are more afraid of you than you are of them.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Enters the kitchen, offscreen)''
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe I'm thinking of ducklings.
|-
!
|''Loud screams and crashes come from the kitchen, while kitchen supplies and Dipper's hat are thrown outside.''

!Dipper
|Ow, ow!
|-
!Soos
|''(Singing)'' Swabbing on disinfectant, doo doo doo...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' Why does Grunkle Stan always pick on me? Think about it! The more painful or difficult the chore is, the more likely it is I'll have to do it. Why doesn't he pick on you guys?
|-
!Soos
|Dipper, Stan's personality is one of life's great mysteries. Like whether or not it's possible to lick your own elbow.
|-
!Mabel
|I bet you can't!
|-
!Soos
|I bet I can! ''(Tries to lick elbow and walks away)''
|-
!Mabel

!Mabel
|''(Chanting)'' Lick that elbow! Lick that elbow!
|-
!Soos
|Like the infinite horizon, it eludes my grasp.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Offscreen, laughs)''

!Mabel
|Is that who I think it is?

|-
!Bill Cipher
|''(Laughs)'' Oh, oh, [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]! It is good to be back. Name's Bill Cipher, and I take it you're some kind of living ventriloquist dummy? ''(Laughs)'' I'm just kidding, I know who you are, Gideon!
|-
!Gideon
|W-what are you? H-how do you know my name?
|-
!Bill
|Oh, I know lots of things! ''(Body shows pictures of various cryptic locations. In a slow, deep voice:)'' LOTS OF THINGS... ''(Body returns to normal)'' Hey, look what I can do! ''(Gestures toward a deer, the deer's teeth then fly into his hand. Gives the teeth to Gideon)'' Deer teeth! For you, kid! ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Cries out in shock and drops teeth on the ground)'' You're insane!
|-
!Bill
|Sure I am, what's your point? ''(Puts teeth back in deer's mouth and the deer runs away)''
|-
!Gideon
|Listen to me, demon! I have a job for you. I need you to enter the mind of Stanford Pines and steal the code to his safe.
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Laughs)'' Wait... Stan Pines? ''(Body shows pictures of Stan and his [[Stan's Tattoo|tattoo]])'' You know what, kid? You've convinced me! I'm sold! I'll help you with this and in return you can help me with something I've been working on! We'll work out the details later.
|-
!Gideon
|Deal!
|-
!Bill
|''(His hand lights on blue fire and he shakes hands with Gideon)'' Well, time to invade Stan's mind! This should be fun! Remember: reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold, bye! ''(Disappears)''
|-
!Gideon
|It worked! ''(Laughs maniacally)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper sweeping the carpet in the living room while Stan sleeps in his chair.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Mumbling in his sleep)'' Oh, I'm so sorry.
|-
!Dipper
|What is going on in that guy's head? ''(Begins to walk away)''
|-
!
|''Mabel and Soos run in.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! We've gotta help Stan!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, what?
|-
!Soos
|''(While eating [[Nyums]] brand [[Burrito Bites]])'' This evil triangle guy said he's gonna break into Stan's mind and steal the combination to his safe! Also we stopped for snacks on the way here.
|-
!Dipper
|Triangle guy? ''(Takes out [[Journal 3]])'' I feel like I've seen something like this before in the journal... ''(Reading)'' "Beware Bill, the most powerful and dangerous creature I've ever encountered. Whatever you do, never let him enter your mind."
|-
!Stan
|''(Grunts in sleep)''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel and Soos
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan!
|-
!
|''Cut to shadow of Bill entering Stan's mind.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Eyes start glowing blue and grunts while making random movements)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Takes the journal from Dipper; reads)'' It is possible to follow the demon into a person's mind and prevent his chaos. One must simply recite this incantation.
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, this is just great. I spend all day cleaning sinks and fighting bats for Stan and now I have to save him from some crazy brain demon?
|-
!Mabel
|But if we don't do anything Gideon might steal the shack! Or worse!
|-
!Stan
|''(Eyes still glowing blue, he screams)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' Fine. Get ready, guys. We're about to journey into the most horrifying, disturbing place any of us have ever been: our uncle's mind.
|-
!
|''Lightning flashes and dramatic music plays.''
|-
!Soos
|You think I can take these Burrito Bites into Stan's brain? Thumbs up? Thumbs down? ''(Pauses; laughs)'' You know what, I'm just gonna bring 'em.
|-
!
|''Cut to commercial break''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel and Soos around a sleeping Stan in the living room with the lights off and surrounded by a circle of candles''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holding Journal 3)'' Okay, guys, in order to save our uncle, we're gonna have to follow that... dream demon into his mind.
|-
!Soos
|I wonder what Stan's thinking about right now.
|-
!Soos
|''(Using Stan as a ventriloquist dummy, in a high voice)'' I love Soos like a son!
|-
!Dipper
|Soos! This is serious!
|-
!Soos
|''(Still using Stan's mouth in a high voice)'' Sorry!
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|''(Laugh)'' Yeah! ''(High five each other)''
|-
!Dipper
|Let's do this. ''(Puts hand on Stan's head) ''
|-
!
|
''Mabel and Soos also put their hands on Stan's head.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading from journal)'' Videntus omnium. Magister mentium. Magnesium ad hominem. Magnum opus. Habeas corpus! Inceptus Nolanus overratus! Magister mentium! Magister mentium! MAGISTER MENTIUM!
|-
!
|''As Dipper speaks, his eyes go blue, then Soos', then Mabel's and the candles go out, and after the incantation, there is a blue explosion and the gang is inside [[Stan's mindscape|Stan's mind]]. Mabel and Soos make exclamations of awe.''
|-
!Soos
|What the?
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, this is Stan's mind?
|-
!Soos
|I figured there would be more hot old ladies.
|-
!Mabel
|Remember everyone, we've got to look out for the triangle guy.
|-
!Bill
|''(Arriving)'' Yeah, look out for the triangle guy!
|-
!Soos
|It's him! It's the guy!
|-
!Mabel
|You leave our uncle's brain alone, you isosceles monster! ''(Runs inside Bill, seconds later comes back outside)'' Gotcha! Wait, what?
|-
!Bill
|Ah, Stan's family, we meet at last! Question Mark, Shooting Star, Pine Tree, I had a hunch I might bump into you! ''(Shoots a hole in Dipper's chest)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Screams, deep breathing)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sticks her hand through Dipper)'' Boop!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel! What do you want with our uncle's mind anyway?
|-
!Bill
|Oh, just the code to the old man's safe! Inside the shack is a maze of a thousand doors representing your uncle's memories. Behind one of them is a memory of him inputting the code! I just need to find it and Gideon will pay me handsomely.
|-
!Mabel
|Not if we stop you!
|-
!Bill
|Hah, fat chance! I'm the master of the mind. ''(Blue flame encircles him) ''I even know what you're thinking right now! 
|-
!Mabel
|That's impossible, no one can guess what I'm thinking!

!
|''Bill makes [[Xyler and Craz]] appear.''
|-
!Xyler
|Whoa, where are we, bro?
|-
!Craz
|We must be in heaven, 'cause I just saw an angel! ''(points to Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hugging Craz's leg)'' I'm never letting go of your leg!
|-
!Bill
|You're out of your league, kids. Turn around now before you see something you might regret. Later, suckers! ''(Crashes through wall of mindscape Mystery Shack)''
|-
!Dipper
|We're goin' in! Mabel, can we leave those guys out here? Looking at them -- hurts my eyes...
|-
!Mabel
|No! They can help us!
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|Totally! Arm throne! ''(Carry Mabel in arms)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Chuckles)''
|-
!Soos
|Dude! Arm throne! ''(Starts walking after Dipper)'' Arm throoone!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Screams)''

!
|''Everyone heads into the shack and awes.''

!Xyler
|I also think it's radical!

|-
!
|''Some of Stan's fears are shown, and it cuts to the gang entering Stan's memories, all speaking.''
|-
!Soos
|Whoa, look! All of Stan's memories!
|-
!Dipper
|Great. Sure there's plenty of memories of Stan bossing me around, can't wait to see more of that.
|-
!Mabel
|Come on Dipper, we've gotta find the code before Bill does!
|-
!Craz
|Mabel is talking!
|-

|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(Laughs)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs; thinking)'' This is going terrible. I can't think of anything to say and she.. looks weird up close. Think of a way out! ''(Aloud:)'' NON-SPECIFIC EXCUSE! ''(Knocks over food and runs away)''

!
|''Dipper discovers a door written "Dipper Memories."''

!Dipper
|Look, guys! Memories about me! ''(Opens the door)''

!Soos
|That doesn't seen like a good idea.

!Dipper
|I just wanna know what the old guy really thinks of me.
|-
!Mabel
|We already know how Stan feels about us! He loves us! We're great. ''(Walks away)''

|Okay. Just a quick peek.
|-
!
|''Dipper walks by the doors. The sound Stan calling Dipper echoes. Dipper walks in front of one of them and opens the door. Inside is a memory of Stan making Dipper chop firewood.''
|-
!Stan
|No buts! Now go and chop that firewood already! ''(Hits Dipper's head with a newspaper)''
|-
!
|''Dipper walks away to chop the firewood. Stan sits on the couch.''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, Stan, I've been meaning ask you. Why are you so hard on Dipper all the time?
|-
!Stan
|Look, Soos, I'm gonna let you in on something. Wanna know what I really think? ''(Whispers to Soos)''
|-
!
|''Dipper leans to listen what Stan is talking.''
|-
!Stan
|''(In a whisper) ''The kid's a loser. He's weak! He's an utter embarrassment! I just wanna get rid of him.
|-
!
|''Dipper closes the door, depressed. Cuts to Bill, disguised as Soos, and Mabel.''
|-
!Soos
|Hello? Code to Stan's safe? Where are you?
|-
!Xyler
|Opening and closing doors is fun!
|-
!Craz
|I can do it also!
|-
!
|''Soos opens a door. Inside the door Stan pushes buttons of the [[vending machine]]. The vending machine opens and a secret hallway appears.''
|-
!Stan
|If only people knew the truth, that hidden behind this vending machine, I secretly have a -
|-
!Soos
|BORING! ''(Closes the door)''
|-
!
|''Cuts to Mabel in front of a door written "Top Secret" on top of it. ''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright guys, I have a good feeling about this door.
|-
!
|''Mabel opens the door. Inside it has a memory of Stan in the bathroom.''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, Mr. Tummy! ''(Changes his voice)'' Hey, Mr. Stan! ''(Back to normal voice)'' Are you hungry?'' (Changes his voice again) ''Yes!
|-
!Soos
|AAH..
|-
!Stan
|Eat your crackers! ''(Changes his voice)'' Yum yum yum yum!
|-
!Mabel
|Sweet Sally!'' (Closes the door)''
|-
!Soos
|Hah, we've been searching forever! What if the triangle guy finds the memory before we do?
|-
!Mabel
|If we wanna find Stan's memory, we gotta think like Stan. He's always hiding stuff, right?
|-
!Soos
|Yeah! Like how he hides his arrest warrants under that rug in the gift shop?
|-
!Mabel
|Soos, that's it! Look! ''(Walks to a rug and finds a door under it)''
|-
!All
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Opens the door)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Kisses the deed and puts it into the safe)'' There ya go. ''(Closes the safe door)'' And now to input the code. 13, 44, and finally..
|-
!Soos
|''(Closes the door)'' Dude! we found it!
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah!
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|But what do we do now? Jinx!
|-
!Mabel
|Um... um... Let's just destroy the door before Bill can find it! ''(Finds a battle-ax)''
|-
!Soos
|Wait! Maybe I should do it! My big fat arms are great at destroying stuff!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, okay.
|-
!
|''Soos begins to lifts up the door with some kind of psychic power. As he does this, another Soos walks in.''
|-
!Soos
|Hey guys! I just saw a memory of Stan roller skating and wearing short-shorts! ''(Pause)'' Didn't look... didn't look that bad! Hey, something weird is goin' on here.
|-
!Bill
|''(Still in Soos' form, laughs; turns back to normal)'' Boy, you kids sure are gullible! I knew you'd lead me straight to the code! ''(Laughs)'' It's funny how dumb you are.
|-
!
|''Commercial break.''
|-
!Bill
|The combination to Stan's safe. Boy, that was even easier then I thought!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, yeah? Well, you're a-a stink face!
|-
!Xyler
|Awesome comeback, Mabel!
|-
!Mabel
|Don't treat me like a child, Xyler.
|-
!Bill
|Later, suckers!'' (Flies away)''
|-
!Mabel
|Come on! We've gotta save Stan!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walking up from the stairs)'' What's the point? Why should I save him, huh? I work for Stan day and night and all he does in return is say he wants to get rid of me.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, I'm sure that's not true.
|-
!Dipper
|I saw it with my own eyes in one of his memories, Mabel! He always picked on me and now I know why. Stan hates me!
|-
!All except Dipper
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, it doesn't matter what you saw. If we don't stop Bill, we'll lose the Shack!
|-
!Dipper
|No! You know what? Not this time. For once this is one of Stan's problems I'm not gonna fix.
|-
!Mabel
|Fine. Come on, Soos. We'll save Stan ourselves.
|-
!Soos
|Dipper, you're a cool dude, but... this isn't cool, dude.
|-
!Craz
|Let's go, Xyler.
|-
!Xyler
|All right, Craz!
|-
!Craz
|Those are our names!
|-
!
|''Mabel, Craz, Xyler and Soos leave. Cuts to Bill. Bill opens every door he passes. Then a phone ringing sound is heard. Bill touches his bow tie revealing he had a call from Gideon.''
|-
!Bill
|Y'ello?
|-
!Gideon
|Bill! Did you find the memory with the combination yet?
|-
!Bill
|Relax, short stack. I got it right here. 
|-
!Gideon
|Ha ha ha! Perfect. now give it to me and we'll finish our bargain.
|-
!Bill
|Finally! It's--you got a pen there? It's 13, 44... ''(The door gets hit by a nyarf gun)'' Ah! No no no! Wait, no!
|-
!
|''The door falls to the [[Bottomless pit (place)|bottomless pit]] from one of Stan's memories.''
|-
!Stan
|...and none more bottomless than the bottomless pit! Which you can see here is bottomless. ''(Watches the door fall)'' Whooh! Whatever that was, it's gone forever!
|-
!
|''The door closes. Behind Bill is Mabel who shot the door with a nyarf gun.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha! Boom!
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|Mabel did it!
|-
!Soos
|The Shack is safe!
|-
!Gideon
|The deal's off!
|-
!Bill
|Wa-wait! No! Wait!
|-
!Gideon
|I'm switchin' to plan B!
|-
!
|''The screen turns off and Bill's body cracks to pieces and falls off. Then Bill's body reappears as red.''
|-
!Bill
|YOU! You can't even imagine what you just cost me! Do you have any idea what I'm like... ''(In a low, demonic voice)'' WHEN I'M MAD???!!
|-
!
|''Several characters pass by Bill's eye. Then a rock in the shape of Stan's head pops out from their feet and raises up. Bill's size starts increasing.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Soos
|So I guess he gets really mad when he gets mad.
|-
!Bill
|''(In a low, demonic voice:)'' EAT NIGHTMARES!
|-
!All
|''(Scream)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper walking around, finding a way out.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh! How do I get out of this place? ''(Opens doors)'' Exit? Hello? (''Opens the door with a memory of him chopping wood'') Aw, this again?
|-
!Stan
|He's a loser. He's weak. I just wanna get rid of him.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Starts to close the door)''
|-
!Stan
|Heh, yeah. Those are all things people said about me when I was a boy.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Opens the door)'' Huh?
|-
!Stan
|It was terrible. I was the biggest wimp on the playground!
|-
!
|''A door of Stan's memory opens behind Dipper. It shows Stan as a kid getting bullied by other kids and running with tears.''
|-
!Stan
|So one summer, my [[Filbrick Pines|pop]] signs up me for boxing lessons.
|-
!
|''A door of Stan boxing opens. He is getting punched by his opponent.''
|-
!Stan
|It was even worse than the school yard!
|-
!Young Stan
|Left hook! ''(Punches his opponent)''
|-
!Stan
|Y'know, that time I thought my pop was trying to torture me.
|-
!
|''A door of Stan at the theater opens.''
|-
!Stan
|But wouldn't you know it? The old man was doin' me a favor all along!
|-
!Man
|(''Tries to steal [[Carla McCorkle|Carla's]] bag.'') Give me that bag!
|-
!Carla
|Help! My purse! Help!
|-
!Young Stan
|Left hook! ''(Punches the man)''
|-
!
|''The people all around Stan cheers for him. Carla gives him a kiss.''
|-
!Stan
|You see it? That why I'm hard on Dipper. To toughen him up. So when the world fights, he fights back.
|-
!Soos
|Do you think it's actually working?
|-
!Stan
|''(Points at Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper (in the memory)
|''(Chops the wood in a half)'' I-I did it! Ha ha! Yes!
|-
!Stan
|He's really comin' along! When push comes to shove, I'm actually proud of him. Just... don't ever tell him that. His head is big enough as it is.
|-
!Soos
|''(Laughs)'' That's true.
|-
!
|''Dipper grins and puts his hand on the memory. Then he accidentally gets into the memory, facing with Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Whoa, kid, what are you doin' here? Nice hole in your chest, by the way. Let's fix that up. ''(Points his finger and the hole in Dipper's chest regenerates)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wh-what the- How did you do that?
|-
!Stan
|Word to the wise, kid. We're in the mind! You can do what ever you imagine in here! ''(Creates a Pitt Cola and drinks it)''
|-
!Dipper
|Well how about that?
|-
!
|''A fighting sound and Soos', Mabel's scream is heard outside from the memory.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh my gosh, what am I doing? I gotta stop Bill! ''(Runs out of the memory)''
|-
!Stan
|Huh, fighting back.
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill''
|-
!Bill
|One nightmare, coming up!
|-
!Soos
|Nightmare? Hope he doesn't mean that [[British dog man]] I'm always dreaming about...
|-
!
|''The British dog man appears in front of Soos.''
|-
!British dog man
|'Ello, 'ello, 'ello! Who's crike for a stick in the pudding? ''(Pokes Soos with his cane)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Screams)'' It's everything I've ever feared!
|-
!Bill
|You! ''(Strikes a nightmare to Mabel)''

|''Mabel becomes green and ugly. Her voice also changes low and slow.''

|-
!Bill
|And now to finish you all once in for all!
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|No, no!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flies in)'' Hey! Bill!
|-
!Bill
|WHAT?!
|-
!Dipper
|Nice bow tie! ''(Makes a hole in Bill with laser from his eyes)''

|Dude!
|-

|-
!Mabel
|''(In a low voice)'' <span style="font-size:1.06em;line-height:1.4em;">Huh?</span>
|-
!Dipper
|Just think of cool fighting stuff and it will happen. Like this! ''(Gets rid of the British dog man with laser)''
|-
!Soos
|Ha ha, he's dead now.
|-
!Bill
|What? Who told you that! Don't listen to him!
|-
!Mabel
|We can do anything? ''(Comes back to normal, along with her voice)'' Like have kittens for fists? ''(Her fists becomes kittens; as she shoots them at Bill)'' Po-pow! P-p-pow! Pow!
|-
!
|''The kitten fists stick on Bill.''
|-
!Bill
|''(Screams)''

!Mabel
|''(The kittens on her hands start licking her; laughs)'' Well hello, friends!
|-
!Soos
|Anything, huh? Soos love stomach beam stare! (''Shoots colorful question marks from stomach and knocks Bill off)''
|-
!Bill

|-
!Mabel
|Hamster ball shields activate! ''(Creates a hamster ball around herself)''

|Activate!'' (Creates a hamster ball around themselves)''

!
|''The laser gets reflected by the hamster ball and hits Bill in the eye.''
|-
!Bill
|AH! Oh my eye! AAH!
|-
!
|''Mabel, Dipper and Soos' hamster ball breaks.''

!Mabel
|Rise, Xyler! Rise, Craz!
|-
!
|''Xyler and Craz rise from behind her back with musical instruments. They start to play synthesized music''.
|-
!Bill
|No! Synthesized music! It hurts!
|-
!Dipper
|And now to imagine your worst nightmare! A portal out of Stan's mind!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Singing)'' Out of Stan's mi-ind!

!Dipper
|Mabel! Everyone, together!

!
|''The gang all starts to imagine. A hole below Bill appears.''
|-
!Bill
|No, no, no! ENOUGH!! ''(Makes everything white. He becomes yellow again)'' You know, I've been impressed with you guys. You are more clever than you look. Especially the fat one.
|-
!Soos
|''(Pokes Mabel; in a whisper:)'' He's talking about you!
|-
!Bill
|So I'm gonna let you kids off the hook. You might come in handy later. BUT KNOW THIS: A darkness approaches. A [[Weirdmageddon (event)|day]] will come in the future when everything you care about will change! Until then I'll be watching you! I'LL BE WATCHING YOU... ''(Bill disappears, his words echoing)''
|-
!Dipper
|He's gone! we did it! ''(Gang cheers and then they begin to disappear)'' Stan must be waking up.

|What? Did what? What are you all doing here? And why was I dreaming of two brightly colored and radical young men?
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan! You're okay! ''(Hugs Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|What is this, a hug?
|-
!Dipper
|Nope! It's a choke hold. ''(Chokes Stan)''

|''The episode opens with a shot of [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]. Suddenly, a dark shadow covers the entire town. The camera cuts to a wrecking ball destroying the [[Mystery Shack]]. [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] suddenly wakes up and screams.''
|-
!Dipper Pines
|I just had a horrible dream that [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]] stole the [[Mystery Shack deed|deed]] to the Mystery Shack, and kicked us out, and... we all had to move in with [[Abuelita|Soos' grandma]]?
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|That was no dream, dude.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Screams)''
|-
!
|''Everyone wakes up.''
|-
!Abuelita
|Shh. ''Por favor.''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, sorry, Abuelita.
|-
![[Mabel Pines]]
|Oh, Soos, your grandma is so adorable! And her skin is old lady soft. ''(Touching her skin)'' Haaaahhh!
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|Mabel, quit being creepy! The news is finally on.
|-
![[Shandra Jimenez]]
|''(On the TV)'' In a movement that has all of Gravity Falls buzzing, child psychic Gideon Gleeful ''(shows a picture of a winking Gideon surrounded by a litter of playful puppies)'' has taken surprise ownership of the Mystery Shack, previously belonging to area shyster, Stanford Pines. ''(Shows a picture of Stan in a devil costume surrounded by fire)''
|-
!Stan
|That picture's taken out of context.
|-
!Shandra
|Now that you have the shack, what exactly are you planning to do with it?
|-
!Gideon Gleeful
|I have a big announcement to make today, and I'd like to cordially invite all the good people of Gravity Falls to join me. Free admission to anyone who wears their Gideon pins! It's my face! ''(Winks)''
|-
!Dipper
|I just can't believe Gideon beat us. Normally I'm able to save the day. This is all my fault.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry, Dipper. Looks like Mabel's going to have to be the hero of the family now. I'll defeat Gideon with my ''[[Mabel's grappling hook|grappling hook]]!''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, no offense, but that grappling hook has literally never helped us once.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh yeah? Jelly grab!
|-
!
|''Mabel shoots her grappling hook at a jar of jelly, causing it to break and splatter jelly on the walls.''
|-
!Abuelita
|I vacuum the walls now. ''(Starts vacuuming the wall)''
|-
!Soos
|So you lost the Shack. Look on the bright side, dudes! Now you get to live here with me, Soos! Hey, anyone want to play race cars? They're out of batteries but we can make pretend. 
|-

|''Soos spits out two pieces of food.''

!Dipper
|Yeah!

|I've been meaning to ask you boy. Shouldn't you be celebratin' Gideonland instead of stickin' your head in that there book all day?
|-
!Gideon
|Father, have I ever told you the true nature of this book?
|-
!
|''The scene transitions to someone writing Journal 2.''
|-
!Gideon (narrating)
|It was written many years ago by a [[Ford Pines|brilliant unknown author]] who learned secrets too powerful for one man.
|-
!
|''The Author is shown burying the book.''
|-
!Gideon (narrating)
|
He hid his journals where he thought no one would ever find 'em.
|-
!
|''The scene fades to the books [[Journal 1]] and [[Journal 2]] coming closer together with Gravity Falls on fire and Gideon in the background. After that it shows the six-fingered hand, but instead of it being gold, it portrays the universe.''
|-
!Gideon (narrating)
|Because he knew that if the journals were ever bought together, they would unleash a gateway to unimaginable power.
|-
!
|''The scene fades back to Gideon.''
|-
!Gideon
|Codes and maps had led me to believe that the other book is buried somewhere on this very property, and I intend to find it!
|-
!Bud
|So that's why you wanted the Mystery Shack.
|-
!
|''The scene shows Gideon with a shovel.''
|-
!Gideon
|That's right, father, it's time to begin the search for the other journal!
|-
!
|''The scene fades to Old Man McGucket working on the Gideon-bot, then fades to Dipper, Mabel and Soos.''
|-
!Mabel
|Go red car!
|-
!Soos
|Go other red car!
|-
!Dipper
|This would be a lot more fun with batteries.
|-
!
|''Soos moves the red car then it bumps the other red car out of its place.''
|-
!
|''Stan walks into the room and clears his throat''
|-
! Stan
|Kids, we've got to talk. Look I've been thinking and... I can't take care of you anymore. I don't have house or a job. The plan is, you're goin' home. Your bus leaves tomorrow, here are your tickets.
|-
!Dipper
|But Grunkle Stan, you can't give up!
|-
!Soos
|Yeah dude, look at these faces!
|-
!
|''Soos begins nudging Mabel.''
|-
!Soos
|Be cuter Mabel! Your summer depends on it!
|-
!Stan
|Look, I lost, okay? The best thing is for you to be with your parents. Sorry kids, Gideon won. ''(Places Dipper and Mabel's bus tickets on the table)'' Summer's over.
|-
!Soos
|Mr. Pines! RECONSIDER!! ''(Runs after him)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, that's enough. If Stan won't get our home back from Gideon, then we'll have to do it ourselves.
|-
!Mabel
|Gideon may have the upper hand, but we have something he doesn't.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holding out journal)'' The journal!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holding out grappling hook; Simultaneously:)'' A grappling hoo- oh. The Journal... Journal!
|-
!
|''Cut to the outside of the now fenced-off Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright, the bus to take us out of Gravity Falls comes at sundown. If we wanna stay in town we've got to get past those guards, make it through the fence, and get Gideon to hand over that deed.
|-
!Mabel
|Leave that to Mabel. Wa-chaw!
|-
!
|''Mabel shoots the grappling hook. It hits a tree branch, then ricochets to Dipper. It hits him in the face.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah!
|-
!Dipper
|''Now'' will you admit the grappling hook is useless?!
|-
!Mabel
|Nope!
|-
!Dipper
|Okay. What can we use to defeat Gideon? Let's see... Barf fairy?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah!
|-
!Dipper
|Nope. Butternut Squash with a Human Face and Emotions?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah!
|-
!Dipper
|Nope.
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, what's this?
|-
!Dipper
|I stared at this page for hours. It seems like a blueprint to build some kind of strange futuristic super-weapon--
|-
!Mabel
|BORING! To defeat those guards we need some kind of army.
|-
!Dipper
|... Wait a minute! An army! Mabel, that's it! The [[gnomes]]!
|-
!Mabel
|Uhh... ''(Nervously tugs her sweater's collar)''
|-
!
|
''Cuts to the twins entering the [[Gnome forest|forest]].''
|-
!Dipper
|I think this is their hiding spot.
|-
!Mabel
|I wonder what Gnomes do out here all alone in the forest?
|-
!Both
|Aaah!
|-
!
|''They see [[Jeff]] bathing in squirrels.''
|-
!Jeff
|Do do do... ''(sees them)'' Aah! This... this is normal. This is normal for gnomes. Scrub scrub. ''(Scrubs his armpit with a squirrel)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''Look at each other disgusted, and look back at Jeff.''
|-
!Jeff
|Well, well, well. Look who came crawlin' back. Take five, Chris. ''(A squirrel jumps out of the tub)'' You guys keep doin' what you're doin'. So, changed your mind about marryin' me, did ya Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|Ew, hardly. We need your help. And seriously, ew!
|-
!Jeff
|You want our help? After you left me at the alter? No dice!
|-
!Mabel
|But what if we were able to get you a new queen? One even more beautiful than me.
|-
!Dipper
|Her name's Gideon, and she has lovely white hair.
|-
!Jeff
|Whoa. Mature woman, huh? Hey [[Shmebulock]], get my cologne!
|-
!Shmebulock
|''(Comes in)'' Shmebulock!
|-
!Jeff
|Is Shmebulock all you can say?
|-
!Shmebulock
|''(Pauses)'' Shmebulock...
|-
!Jeff
|It's a deal! ''(Shakes hands with Dipper)''
|-
!
|''Cuts to [[Greasy's Diner]].''
|-
!Stan
|Waiter, give me a glass of the strongest most expired apple cider you've got.
|-
!Soos
|Sure thing, Mr. Pines.
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks up)'' Soos? What are you doing here?
|-
!Soos
|''(Cleans glass)'' Since the Mystery Shack shut down, I've had to take on a bunch of part-time jobs. Grave digger, bus driver, really awesome cook... Hey, is the kitchen supposed to have that much fire in it? ''(The kitchen is in a sea of fire, so Soos runs into kitchen and puts out fire with extinguisher)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Sighs)'' You're a good man-child, Soos, but it's not lookin' good. This whole town loves Gideon and hates me. If only they knew how evil he really was!
|-
!Soos
|''(Walks over to Stan, putting his hand on his shoulder)'' Hey, I'm here for you, dude.
|-
!Stan
|The entire lower half of your body is on fire.
|-
!Soos
|''(Puts his hand on Stan's nose, then pats his arm as smoke emerges from his back)'' Shh, we're having a moment...
|-
!
|''Cuts to construction at the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Gideon
|
Where are you, Journal? ''(Gideon takes shovel and starts to dig)'' Where are you!
|-
!Bud
|Boy, I hate to interrupt you, but you have some guests.
|-
!Gideon
|
What?
|-
!Dipper
|Give us the deed to the shack, Gideon, or else.
|-
!Gideon
|Am I supposed to say, "Or else what?" ''Emphasizes well-built guards behind him'' 
|-
!Mabel
|Yes, you are supposed to say that. ''(Yelling)'' Now!
|-
!
|''Suddenly an army of gnomes surround Gideon; knock out and tie up guards.''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Dipper
|
You're surrounded by an unstoppable gnome army, now give us back our deed and get off our property!
|-
!Jeff
|
And let the marriage ceremony begin!
|-
!Gideon
|''(Sighs)'' Very well. I suppose this deed belongs to—
|-
!
|''Gideon pulls out a whistle and blows it and all the gnomes covers their ears.''
|-
!Gideon
|Ha! What do you know! Works on gnomes too! ''(Gideon blows the whistle again)''
|-
!Jeff
|Stop! We'll do anything! How can we serve you your majesty! ''(Bowing)'' The most beautiful girl we've ever seen!
|-
!Gideon
|I am not a girl!
|-
!Jeff
|Really? But your skin is so soft. You moisturize, or...
|-
!Gideon
|''(Points at Dipper and Mabel)'' Subdue them!
|-
!
|''The gnomes grunt and charge at Dipper and Mabel''
|-
!Gideon
|
I have to admit, kids, I am impressed by your creativity! How did you ever...
|-
!Dipper
|Let go! ''([[Journal 3|Journal&nbsp;3]] falls out of Dippers pocket)'' Oh no!
|-
!Gideon
|No! Could it be? Is it? ''(Gideon runs up to Journal 3)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Laughing)'' Of course! It all makes sense! ''(Dipper struggles to break free from the gnomes)'' The one place I'd never think to look! You had it the whole time! And to think I actually considered you a threat! ''(Gideon flicks Dipper's nose)''
|-
!Dipper
|No! Give it back! ''(Dipper reaches for the journal)''
|-
!Gideon
|Every victory you had was because of your precious book!
|-
!Dipper
|Give it back or I'll—
|-
!Gideon
|''(Interrupting)'' Or you'll what, boy? You'll what? Huh? Huh? No muscles. No brains. Face it! You're nothin' without this! ''(Waves)'' Bye bye forever, y'all! ''(Whistles, and the gnomes carry Dipper and Mabel away)''
|-
!Dipper
|NOOOOOO!
|-
!
|''The scene ends with Gideon holding 3, and [[Old Man McGucket]] working on the [[Gideon-bot]].''
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the gnomes running into the forest, Mabel pacing, and Dipper sitting on the floor.''
|-
!Jeff
|Next time, do your own dirty work, come on boys! ''(The squirrels jump into Jeff's pants)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' Well, that's it. Guess the bus should be here soon.
|-
!Mabel
|What? Dipper, don't give up! You always have a plan!
|-
!Dipper
|No! The journal always has a plan! Think about it, Mabel, Gideon was right. The only courageous or cool things I've ever done have been because of that journal. Without it, I can't help you, or Stan, or anyone.
|-
!Mabel
|
There's gotta be something we can do?
|-
!Dipper
|What can we do?
|-
!
|''The next scene starts with Dipper and Mabel boarding a bus, looking glum.''
|-
!Announcer
|Bus 52, departing Gravity Falls, all aboard.
|-
!
|
''Dipper and Mabel walk to the back of the bus and look out the window to see Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Sorry kids, it's for the best.
|-
!
|''The bus leaves with Wendy, Grunkle Stan, [[Grenda]] and [[Candy Chiu|Candy]] outside the window upset and waving at Dipper and Mabel as the bus departs.''
|-
!Dipper
|Can't believe this is happening.
|-
!
|''Camera pans across to a sign reading: Now leaving Gravity Falls. Scene cuts to the construction of GideonLand.''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Giggles)'' I've got it! I finally got it! ''(Running through the living room, exclaiming at Bud and Mrs. Gleeful)'' Get out!
|-
!Gideon
|It's finally mine! At last, I have journal number ''(places 3 on the table)'' three?! There are THREE of them? But where is journal number one? ''(Thumping table)'' I must have all three for the power to be unlocked! But where could I— Dipper! He must know where it is! He gave me the third one and kept the first for himself! ''(Rips out some of his hair)'' I can't let him leave Gravity Falls! ''(Grabs 2 and 3 and runs out of the Mystery Shack)'' You there! ''(Points at Old Man McGucket working on the Gideon-Bot)'' Is it ready?
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|He he he! Only one way to find out! ''(Pulls lever on Gideon-Bot and the robot glows)''
|-
!
|''Gideon runs inside the robot and is in his motion-sensor suit, he then punches his right hand, and the robot pushes the Gideonland sign into the ground. the Gideon-Bot walks away.''
|-
!McGucket
|I've got a good feelin' about that kid!
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos' house. Soos' grandma is vacuuming the curtains and Stan is sitting on the couch.''
|-
!Stan
|Well Stan, this is it. Rock bottom. No friends, no family, stuck watching infomercials for whatever that is...
|-
![[Bobby Renzobbi]] (on TV)
|Are you sick of piles of owls constantly blocking your drive way? Well then you gotta get [[Owl Trowel|owl trowel]]!
|-
!Stan
|''(Picks up the Gideon pin)'' How did you do it, kid? Why are you always one step ahead? Maybe he really is psychic after... ''(His hearing aid acts up)'' Ah! My hearing aid! What keeps causing that? Wait a minute! That's it! I know Gideon's weakness!
|-
!Abuelita
|''(Brings tea)'' Would Mr. Pines like a...
|-
!
|''Stan kisses Soos' grandma and runs to the door.''
|-
!Abuelita
|I go vacuum my face.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Pines twins on the bus. Dipper is watching through the glass sadly.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, Dipper, wanna play bus seat treasure hunt?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not in the mood.
|-
!Mabel
|Aw, come on! ''(Lifts a seat)'' We got Canadian coins, gum that shaped like Ronald Reagan's head, ooh! Miscellaneous fluid stain?
|-
!Dipper
|Giant robot!
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, a giant robot... Wait, what?
|-
!Dipper
|Look! ''(Points at the Gideon bot)''
|-
!
|''Gideon bot runs to the bus yelling.''
|-
!Gideon
|Halt! I command you to halt!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Screams)''
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel runs to the bus driver.''
|-
!Mabel
|Mr. Bus driver! There is a giant Gideon bot coming towards us!
|-
!Soos
|Oh hey, dudes!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Soos!
|-
!Soos
|Don't worry guys. I've been a part-time bus driver for at least 40 minutes. One of these is probably a clutch... ''(Pulls the clutch)'' Hang on, dudes!
|-
!
|''Gideon-bot tries to catch the bus.''
|-
!Mabel
|Soos, look out!
|-
!
|''Gideon-bot blocks the way with its hand. Soos turns the bus and smashes through a "Road Closed" sign. The Gideon-bot starts to climb up the mountain.''
|-
!Dipper
|He already won! What does he want from us?
|-
!Gideon
|''(Inside the bot)'' I got you in my sight!
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, cliff!
|-
!
|''Soos breaks the bus right before the bus falls off the cliff. The wheel of the bus is not on the cliff so it can't move. The Gideon-bot comes right after and shakes the bus and tears off the ceiling of it, revealing there is only Soos.''
|-
!Soos
|Okay. What's closest to our present situation. ''(Looking at the "Bus Emergency Manual")'' Raccoon in the engine or angry grandparent won't leave bus? ''(Pause)'' Proba-probably the second one.
|-
!
|''The Gideon-bot turns itself finding the Pines twins on the bridge. The Pines twins run but soon find that the bridge had dead ends. The Gideon-bot jumps on the bridge.''
|-
!Gideon
|Tell me! Where is Journal #1?!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Journal #1?
|-
!Gideon
|Don't play games with me, boy!
|-
!
|''The Gideon-bot drives the twins to the end and punches the cliff, causing rocks to fall on the twins.''
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know what you're talking about! You took the only journal I ever had! What do you even want with these journals anyway?
|-
!
|''The Gideon-bot takes the twins. Mabel resists.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Hits the hand of the Gideon-bot)'' Let go of her!
|-
!Gideon
|Ha ha ha, you still think you're some kind of hero? ''(Throws Dipper away)''
|-
!
|''Dipper lands on the ground.''
|-
!Gideon
|Once I find the final journal I'll rule this town! With you as my queen! ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! Help me! HELP!
|-
!Gideon (In Dipper's mind)
|Face it kid, you're nothing without that journal. How are you gonna fight then? No muscles. No brains. What are you gonna do, huh? What are you gonna do!
|-
!
|''Dipper sadly walks to the forest. But then, Dipper runs and jumps off the cliff breaking in the Gideon-bot, tackling Gideon.''
|-
!Dipper
|Let go of my sister!
|-
!
|''The Gideon-bot's head moves, showing that Dipper hit Gideon.''
|-
!Gideon
|Never! I finally won this time!
|-
!
|''It shows the Gideon-bot fighting, which is Gideon's movement inside. Gideon then tackles Dipper and punches him. Dipper stands up and blocks Gideon's punch. Then he makes Gideon's fist to punch himself. Then Dipper makes him punch a little stronger which makes the Gideon-bot's head turn around.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Grabbing the thumb)'' Careful in there!
|-
!
|''The bot wakes a bit then falls off the bridge. Dipper and Mabel falls off from the bot, screaming.''
|-
!Soos
|Dudes! Nooooooooooo!
|-
!
|''The bot falls on the ground and it causes an explosion big enough for everyone in the town to see. The Gideon-bot is broken, and its pieces are all around. Then something comes down from the top with a string. It was Dipper and Mabel, with her grappling hook.''
|-
!Mabel
|GRAPPLING HOOK!!! Told you it will come in handy!
|-
!
|''Mabel and Dipper land on the ground safely.''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, that was amazing!
|-
!Mabel
|Not amazing as you defeating that robot!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! My journal! ''(Picks up the journal)''
|-
!
|''The cops come and lots of people starts to gather around.''
|-
!Man
|Is this the thing that exploded?
|-
!Woman
|What's going on?
|-
!Man 2
|What is that? It's over here!
|-
!
|''Gideon comes out from the Gideon-bot.''
|-
!Deputy Durland
|''(Runs to Gideon)'' Gideon! Oh, good heavens! What on earth happened here?
|-
!Gideon
|It was the Pines twins! They tried to attack me and blow up my statue with dynamites! Arrest 'em!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|What?
|-
!Dipper
|Officers, he's lying!
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|Sorry kids, but we trust Gideon. And nothing short of a miracle would ever change our-
|-
!
|''Stan comes in a car screaming.''
|-
!Stan
|Wait! Wait! Stop everything! I've got somethin' to say!
|-
!Blubs
|Not this guy again.
|-
!Stan
|Just wait! Look! You guys all think Gideon is so perfect and honest, ''(mocking Gideon)'' "Oh! I could never tell a lie! I'm Gideon!"
|-
!Blubs
|He's more honest than you!
|-
!Durland
|Yeah! And he's psychic too!
|-
!Stan
|How's this for psychic? Bam! ''(Kicks the Gideon-bot; a panel falls off)'' Take a good look!
|-
!
|''Inside of the bot there are many screens showing the Gravity Falls' people.''
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Wait a minute, is that ME?
|-
!Lazy Susan (On TV)
|The secret ingredient to my coffee omelet is coffee!
|-
!Toby
|And me!
|-
![[Unnamed doctor|Doctor]] (On Tv)
|I can verify that that birthmark is indeed disgusting.
|-
!Toby (On TV)
|Hooray!
|-
!Crowd
|That's me! That's me!
|-
!Stan
|That's right, these pins are hidden cameras! And my hearing aid was picking up the feedback! Who's the fraud now? ''(Breaks the pin revealing there was a camera in the eye of it)''
|-
!
|''The people all put away the pin and looks at Gideon.''
|-
!Durland
|Gideon, we gave you our trust...
|-
!Manly Dan
|You LIED to us!
|-
!Gideon
|Please, I... It's not what it looks like... What are you gonna do with me?
|-
!Durland
|[[Tyler Cutebiker|Tyler]]?
|-
!
|''The camera moves to Tyler, who is next to Gideon.''
|-
!Tyler
|Get 'im... ''(Wipes tears)'' Get 'im!
|-
!Blubs
|Lil' Gideon, you are under arrest for conspiracy, fraud, and breaking our hearts. Durland, the tiny handcuffs.
|-
!
|''Durland puts the tiny handcuffs on Gideon''
|-
!Gideon
|Wha- no!
|-
!Stan
|Just one more thing.
|-
!Gideon
|Let go of me! Ow! Ow! Ow!
|-
!Stan
|I believe this belongs to me.
|-
!Gideon
|No! No! Watch the hair! You can't do this to me! Y'all are sheep! You need me! I'll be back! You'll hear from my lawyers!
|-
!Shandra
|There you have it. Local hero Stanford Pines has just exposed Li'l Gideon as a fraud. Anything you have to say to the town, Stanford?
|-
!Stan
|The Mystery Shack is back, baby!
|-
!
|''Cut to the inside of the gift shop which is more successful than ever. Stan is taking money from customers.''
|-
!Stan
|Ahaha! Oh, thank you, thank you!
|-
!
|''Cut to the twins' attic bedroom, Mabel and Dipper are unpacking.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|Uh, you kiddos settlin' back in okay?
|-
!Mabel
|Yep! All of my favorite moldy spots on the ceiling are still there! Even you, Daryl.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, Grunkle Stan, me and Mabel have been talking, And I think there's something we should finally tell you.
|-
!Dipper
|This is a journal I found in the woods. ''(Dipper hands Stan the journal to peruse)'' It talks about all the crazy stuff that goes on in Gravity Falls. Gideon nearly destroyed the whole town trying to find it. I don't know what it means, or who wrote it. But, after all we've been through, maybe you should finally know about it.
|-
!
|''Stan solemnly closes the book.''
|-
!Stan
|I'm glad you showed me this, Dipper... AHAHAHA! Now I know where you've been getting it all from! Spookums and monsters. This spooky book has been filling your head with crazy conspiracies!
|-
!Dipper
|But it's all real!
|-
!Stan
|Haha. You gotta quit readin' this fantasy nonsense for your own good. Although some of these would make great attractions! Can't come up with this stuff! Mind if I borrow this? ''(Stan gets up, taking the book with him and starts to leave)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, no! Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|"Magic book." ''(Laughs)'' Ridiculous!
|-
!Dipper
|Stan, I need it!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, you don't need that book! Don't you see? On your own you defeated a giant robot with nothing but your bare hands! You're a hero whether you've got that journal or not!
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa. Thanks, Mabel. I still want it back though.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm sure you'll get it back. What would a boring old man like Stan want with that book anyway?
|-
!Soos
|''(Shoots water guns at Dipper and Mabel and pops out of cardboard box)'' Soos-ed!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel get up and laughingly chase after Soos.''
|-
!
|''The camera pans down to the gift shop. Stan enters a code to enter the doorway behind the [[vending machine]]. He climbs down a set of stairs to an elevator. He opens a panel besides the elevator and inputs the alchemical symbols for "composition," "pulverize," "digestion," and "fusion" followed by the 'down' button. He enters and the elevator and goes to the third floor. Stan exits into [[Underground laboratory|a room]] filled with complex looking machines and sensors. He walks past them to a desk and switchboard. He opens the desk and pulls out a book, revealing it to be [[Journal 1|Journal #1]].''
|-
!Stan
|After all these years. 
|-
!
|''Stan sets down his journal, Journal #2 (which he had swiped from Gideon when he picked up the deed to the Mystery Shack), and Journal #3.''
|-
!Stan
|Finally, I have them all.
|-
!
|''Stan puts together [[Journal 1|Journals 1]], 2, and 3, revealing a complex image algorithm. He confers it as he presses buttons and switches. [[Universe portal|A machine]] beyond the glass of the switchboard lights up.''
|-
!Stan
|It's working!
|-
!
|''Stan rushes to the room with the machine and pushes a large lever in front of it. The machine crackles with large bursts of electricity sending beams of light in every direction, and finally turns on completely; a bright, white light emanating from it's central hole, blowing a steady stream of air at Stan. Stan stands proudly in front of it. His hands on his hips, and smiles in satisfaction.''
|-
!Stan
|Here we go.

!Stan Pines
|Thirty long years and it's all led up to this. My greatest achievement! ''(Pauses and looks down)'' Probably should've worn pants. ''(The machine spouts out some fire that hits Stan in the shoulder and he pats himself on his shoulder to get rid of the fire)'' Feisty, ''(smiles)'' I like it. ''(Flips switches, looks at readouts)'' If I finally pull this off, it'll all have been worth it. ''(Stan sits down in his chair)'' I just have to keep playing it cool; if anyone ever finds out about this... ''(He looks at a picture of [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]])'' Yeah, right. I've come this far. Who could possibly catch me now? ''(He pulls on a six-fingered glove and pulls a switch labeled Max.

|Oh right. Showtime.

!Stan
|Welcome, to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!

!
|''[[Tourists]] cheer for Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|We're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk Li'l Gideon! ''(Grabs a Li'l Gideon doll)''
|-
!Tourists
|Boo!
|-
!Stan
|Please, please... boo harder! ''(Gestures)''
|-
!Tourists
|BOO!
|-
!Stan
|But I didn't catch that porkchop all alone. These two scamps deserve SOME of the glory ''(Playfully rubs Dipper's hat)''
|-
!
|''Mabel elbows Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Okay, okay. Most of the glory.
|-
!
[[Toby Determined]]
|''(Holds up cinder block painted to look like a camera)'' Smile for the camera!
|-
!Stan
|Your camera's a cinder block, Toby.
|-
!Toby
|I just wanna be a part of things...
|-
![[Shandra Jimenez]]
|Smile for a REAL camera.
|-
!Mabel Pines
|Everybody say "Something stupid!"
|-
!Mabel, Stan and Dipper Pines
|''(Mabel pokes her fingers in her cheeks, Stan puts on some jazz hands, and Dipper pretends to choke himself)'' Something stupid!
|-
!Stan
|And don't forget to come to the [[Mystery Shack is Back|after-party]] tonight at eight. ''(Shows After-Party poster)''
|-
!Mabel
|We're doing a karaoke bonanza, people! ''(Grabs karaoke machine)'' Light! Music! Enchantment! ''(Blows confetti out of her hand)'' And an amazing karaoke performance by our family band, [[Love Patrol Alpha]]!
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know about that.
|-
!Stan
|I would never agree to that ever.
|-
!Mabel
|Too late! I wrote your names on the list! It's happening!
|-
!Wendy Corduroy
|''(Blows an air horn)'' Buy a ticket, people! You know you don't have anything going on in your lives! I'm talking to you, [[Pizza Guy]]! Don't lame out on me!
|-
!
|''Tourists follow Wendy outside. Cut to Stan, Dipper and Mabel.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Sighs)'' The town loves us, we finally got that Gideon smell out of the carpet. Everything is finally going my way.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, Grunkle Stan. Now that we have a moment. I've been meaning to ask you for my [[Journal 3|journal]] back.
|-
!Stan
|Wha? Journal? ''("Searches" himself for the journal, pulling it from under the counter)'' Oh! ''(Laughs)'' You mean this old thing! It was so boring I couldn't even finish it.
|-
!
|''Flashback in Stan's office, Stan photocopies Journal 3. Waddles is standing beside the [[Cloning copy machine|copy machine]].''
|-
!Waddles
|''(Squeals)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Points at Waddles)'' You didn't see nothing!
|-
!
|''Cut back to present.''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, you're just gonna give it to me? Just like that?
|-
!Stan
|What else do you want? A kiss on the cheek?
|-
!Dipper
|I... I gotta go! ''(Takes Mabel with him to the attic)''
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
|-
!Stan
|Not gonna happen.
|-
!
|''Cut to attic. Dipper locks the door, turns Mabel's stuffed animals around, pulls down the screen on the window and turns on his electric lamp.''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, we've gotta talk. Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer, and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls. Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal. But why? ''(Starts pacing up and down the room)'' Who wrote it? Where are all the other journals? What was [[Bill Cipher|Bill]] talking about when he said "everything was going to change"? There's something HUGE going on right under our noses. And it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it.
|-
!Mabel
|Bro, you looked at that thing like, a bazillion times. There's nothing left to discover! Half the pages are blank, remember?
|-
!Dipper
|''(While flipping through pages of Journal 3:)'' I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry Dipper! ''(Lifts up Waddles)'' Lord Mystery Ham is on the case! ''(In British accent, pretending to be Waddles:)'' "I play by me own rules! Wot? Wot?"
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know why I tell you things...do you hear that?
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack parking lot. A car parks. Two men step out of the car and look at the Shack.''
|-
!Soos
|Hey, Mr. Pines, what's that code word I'm supposed to yell when I see a [[government vehicle]]?
|-
!Stan
|Wait, what? ''(Stan goes near Soos and looks outside the window too)'' Government vehicle?
|-
!
|''(A "U.S. Government" vehicle arrives near the Mystery Shack, a "USEXEMPT" is on the vehicle's number-plate, and a sticker that says "Honk If You Want To Be Arrested" is on the back of the car. Stan, with a scared look on his face, quickly closes the window, goes to the Mystery Shack's intercom and screams into it)''
|-
!Stan
|''(From the Mystery Shack's speaker:)'' The Mystery Shack is now closed, everybody out! I will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly!
|-
!
|''Mabel and Dipper run to Stan while all the customers are leaving the gift shop.''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, what's happening?
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, you never shut down the gift shop.
|-
!
|''Stan is walking nervously in the gift shop, a door bell ring is heard and a few knocks after it.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens the door with a big smile)'' Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen! What can I get you? ''(Stan takes out a snow globe and an U.F.O key chain of his jacket)'' Key chains? Snow globes? These rare photos of American presidents? ''(Stan pulls a five dollar bill out of his sleeve as he begins to sweat)''
|-
!
|''Two men are shown standing in the doorway in front of Stan, showing their government I.D. cards.''
|-
!Powers
|My name is Agent Powers and this is Agent Trigger, we're here to investigate reports of mysterious activity in this town.
|-
!Trigger
|''(Points at Stan)'' Activity!
|-
!Stan
|Mysterious activity? In the Mystery Shack? You gotta be joking!
|-
!Powers
|I assure you I'm not. I was born with a rare disorder that made me physically incapable of experiencing humor.
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs nervously)''
|-
!Powers
|I don't understand that sound you're making with your mouth. Now if you'll excuse us we are conducting an investigation.
|-
!
|''Both men enter the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Trigger
|''(Pokes Stan menacingly)'' Investigation!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait! Wait, did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?
|-
!Powers
|That information is classified ''(kneels down)'', but yes. Look. Between you and me I believe there is an conspiracy of paranormal origin all connected to this town. ''(Close-up)'' We're just one small lead away from blowing the lid of this entire mystery.
|-
!Dipper
|Are you kidding me? I'm investigating the exact same thing! I found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers. If we work together, we could crack the case!
|-
!Powers
|''(Checks Agent Trigger)'' If you have evidence of these claim, ''(gives Dipper his card)'' we should talk.
|-
!Dipper
|We could talk right now! Please please. C-Come in! I have so much to show you!
|-
!Stan
|Hehe, I'm sorry agents. The kid has an overactive imagination. And like, a sweating problem.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Off screen:)'' Haha! Zing!
|-
!Stan
|Paranormal town stuff is just part of gift shop lore. Sells more tickets you know? ''(Snaps fingers)''
|-
!Soos
|Popodopopo! Swag! ''(Sticks "What is the Mystery Shack?" bumper stickers to both agents and puts some funny antennae on their heads)''
|-
!Powers
|We have other spots to investigate. We'll be on our way.
|-
!Trigger
|''(Takes ten Stan bobbleheads)'' I'm confiscating this for evidence.
|-
!Agent Powers
|Smart move.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs)'' Wait! No, wait! We got so much to talk about!
|-
!Stan
|''(Stops Dipper)'' Hold it kiddo. Trust me, the last thing you want around during a party, is cops. ''(Closes [[vending machine]])'' I'm confiscating that card. ''(Takes card from Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Stan
|Now how's about you being a normal kid. Flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a window sill. ''(Puts card in "Contraband Box" and walks into the living room)''
|-
!Dipper
|But Grunkle Stan! You don't understand!
|-
!Stan
|And don't go talking to those agents.
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh! That could've been my big break!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Takes journal)'' Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan is right. We're throwing a party tonight! Can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not gonna raise the dead. I just need a chance to show those agents my book!
|-
!Mabel
|Trust me Dipper, the only book you'll need tonight is right here: Boop! ''(Shows him her "Karaoke Songs" book)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holds book)''
|-
!Mabel
|I say kara–, you say –oke! kara– ''(raises her arms)'', kara– ''(raises her arms)'', kara– ''(raises her arms)''. I could do this all day.
|-
!
|''Cut to party, Soos places a nacho bowl, Mabel stands on the podium while Stan walks to the Shack.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Gets shot by Mabel's confetti cannon)'' Aah!
|-
!Mabel
|Well, the confetti cannon works! ''(Gasps)'' And the karaoke machine has all the best songs! ''(Reads aloud)'' "We Built This Township on Rock and Roll," "Danger Lane to Highway Town," "[[Taking Over Midnight]]" by &ndra! ''(Grabs microphone)''
|-
!Stan
|Listen kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing. Trust me.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, karaoke is not about sounding good, it's about sounding terrible, TOGETHER. ''(Big eyes)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Laughs; to Dipper:)'' Check it out! These black lights make my teeth look scary. ''(Turns on black light)'' It's like a crime scene in my mouth! C'mon, you love it.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' It's not fair. Finally I meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town, and Stan confiscates their card.
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure Stan hides, like, everything in his room.
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, if I go into Stan's room I could get in so much trouble.
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, you're probably right. That's what makes it fun, dummy! ''(Puts party hat on Dipper's head)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos stacking Piñatas shaped like Grunkle Stan's head.''
|-
!Soos
|Man, I can't wait to smash these [[Stañatas]]!
|-
![[Grenda]]
|Smash! ''(Dives into the Stañatas, breaking them and the table they are on)'' Grenda has entered the party!
|-
![[Candy Chiu]]
|''(Picking up candy from the destroyed Stañatas)'' Stan's brains look delicious.
|-
!Mabel
|Girls! ''(Hugs Candy and Grenda)''
|-
!Grenda
|Omigosh! Omigosh, Mabel! Is that a boombox sweater?
|-
!Mabel
|See for yourself!
|-
!Grenda
|Poke! ''(Pokes the boombox on Mabel's sweater)''
|-
!
|''The boombox starts flashing and music plays. The three girls start dancing.''
|-
!Grenda
|''(While dancing:)'' Ha! Ha! Yes, work it! Hah!
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack's parking lot as some vehicles pull in. [[Gompers]] is standing on the "Mystery Shack" sign. [[Thompson]], [[Tambry]], [[Nate]] and [[Lee |Lee]] are walking towards the party.''
|-
!Thompson
|Aw, I thought this was gonna be a rave.
|-
!Nate
|Thompson, take off your shirt and make it a rave!
|-
!Thompson
|''(While taking shirt off)'' I'll do anything for your approval!
|-
!Tambry
|''(Takes a picture of shirtless Thompson with her phone)''
|-
!Thompson
|Aw, come on.
|-
!Tambry
|I promise I won't send it to anyone. ''(Presses "SEND ALL" button on her phone)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan at a table with "ADMISSION $10" written on the front.''
|-
![[Lazy Susan]]
|''(Walks past and hands Stan some money while carrying a pie)'' Who's got one good eye and one good pie?
|-
![[Manly Dan]]
|''(Walks past and hands Stan money while carrying two kegs with "MEAT" written on them)'' These kegs are full of MEAT!
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|''(Walks past and hands Stan money while looking at his phone and laughing)'' Tambry sends me the craziest texts!
|-
!Stan
|The whole town is showing up! And no sign of those pesky agents. Wendy, Dipper. How are those posters coming along? ''(Looks at where Dipper and Wendy were, notices they're gone, and frowns) ''Hmm.
|-
!
|''Cut to the door of Stan's room. A piece of wood nailed to the door reads "STAN'S ROOM." A sign hanging on a nail below it reads "NO MINORS ALLOWED." A picture of Dipper with a cross through it and "THAT MEANS YOU!" written on it is pinned to the door. A "Do not disturb" sign is on the doorknob.''
|-
!Wendy
|I'll keep an eye out for Stan. You go rustle through his weird old man biz.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Opens door and walks into Stan's room)'' Alright, Grunkle Stan. Where did you hide that card? ''(Opens drawer with [[Gold Chains For Old Men Magazine]] and other items)'' Nothing. ''(Opens closet)'' Nothing. ''(Opens drawer with knuckledusters and boxing gloves)'' Nothing. ''(Opens chest containing Fully Clothed Women magazine and Lady Swimwear magazine)'' Ew! Pretending I never saw that. ''(Ends up in front of a portrait of Stan)'' Wait a minute... ''(Moves portrait to reveal a secret compartment with a box labelled "Contraband" in it)'' Haha, yes! ''(Takes out box and pulls out Agent Powers' card)'' I got it! ''(Picks up the phone and dials the number on the card)''
|-
!Powers
|''(Through phone:)'' Agent Powers.
|-
!Dipper
|Hi, this is Dipper. Th-The kid from the Mystery Shack. The one with the, um, "sweating problem." I have that journal I wanted to show you!
|-
!Powers
|''(Through phone:)'' And you're certain this "journal" will help our case?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm a hundred percent positive.
|-
!Powers
|''(Through phone:)'' Very well. We're on our way.
|-
!
|''Stan appears and presses a button to end the phone call.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Wendy
|Sorry, Dipper. ''(Shows her phone with the picture of shirtless Thompson on it)'' I got distracted.
|-
!Stan
|Kid, why did you call those agents? I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times! ''(Grabs phone from Dipper)'' There's nothing "supernatural" going on in Gravity Falls. ''(Hangs up phone)''
|-
!Dipper
|Yes, there is! After everything that's happened you ''have'' to know that by now.
|-
!Stan
|All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days. Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over – you're grounded.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Wendy walk away. Dipper looks at Stan angrily.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Sighs)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the vending machine. Stan enters the code, goes inside it, then checks to see if anyone is watching before closing it behind him.''

!
|''Cut to the party, Mabel walks from left to right.''

!Mabel
|''(To unnamed kids and [[Unnamed rich son|rich boy]]:)'' Hey boys! Looking good! ''(To [[Gorney]]:)'' Gorney! You clean up nice! (To [[Mr. Poolcheck]]:) Mr. Poolcheck move those crazy legs. ''(Softly:)'' You-you weird pool man. (To [[Sheriff Blubs]] and [[Deputy Durland]]:) What's the problem officers? Did you catch my face going ninety smiles per hour?
|-
!Durland
|We've got complaints about the loudest party in town.
|-
!Blubs
|Three words: We want in.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Lifts up party horns and put them in Durland and Blubs' mouths; whispers:)'' Welcome to your dreams!
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|''(Blows party horns)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mystery Shack parking lane, the government vehicle from earlier appears. Agent Trigger and Agent Powers get out of it. They look at their watches.''
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, I'm so glad to see you. Working together we can crack all of the big questions of Gravity Falls! ''(Agents look at each other)'' Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for. ''(Gives book to Agents, they start reading)'' I'm thinking full scale investigation. Forensics, researchers. Do you guys have a helicopter? ''(Chuckles)'' I'm sorry, "helicop''ters''."
|-
!Powers
|Kid, I'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop. ''(Points backwards)'' I mean, [[Journal 3#Leprecorn|Leprecorn]]? I can't be the only one who thinks that's not funny.
|-
!Trigger
|I can confirm. ''(Shakes his head)'' Not funny.
|-
!Dipper
|No, no, no! It's real, I swear! You should "send it to the lab." Am I saying that right?
|-
!Powers
|''(Hands Dipper back the journal)'' Your uncle was right about that overactive imagination of yours. We've got paperwork to do, kid.
|-
!Trigger
|''Boring''. Paperwork.
|-
!Dipper
|WAIT! This book is real. ''(Flipping through pages)'' Gnomes, cursed objects, spells! LISTEN! Uh, uh, ''Corpus Levitus! Diablo Dominus! MONDO VICIUM!''
|-
!
|''"Vicium" echos through the air, as a large gust builds up. The ground starts shaking.''
|-
!Dipper
|Huh?
|-
!Both Agents
|AAH!
|-
!
|''A huge crack forms between Dipper's feet he jumps away and lands near the Agents. Green smoke comes out of the crack. A zombie slowly climbs out and roars.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha, a zombie! A real, actual, zombie. See? Spooky journal, 100% real. Now can we work together?
|-
!Powers
|Mother of all that is holy!
|-
!Trigger
|What do we do?
|-
!Dipper
|It's just one zombie, trust me I see stuff like this ''all'' the time
|-
!
|''Dipper scans trough his journal, looking for a solution. Then after a few seconds the zombie roars in his face about to bite him.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Screams)''
|-
!
|''Agent Powers quickly hits the zombie with a rock, knocking it out.''
|-
!Dipper
|Whew. Oh, good thing it was just that one.
|-
!
|''The ground starts shaking again more cracks form, more green smoke, and suddenly hundreds of zombies appear and start going after Dipper, Agent Trigger, and Agent Powers.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh my gosh! You guys can help right?!
|-
!Powers
|Kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years but we have never seen anything like this before!
|-
!Trigger
|Get down! ''(Zombies tackle them)''
|-
!
|''Zombies pull the agents into the darkness of the forest, leaving Dipper by himself.''
|-
!Dipper
|OH, MY GOSH, WHAT HAVE I DONE?!
|-
!
|''Cuts to the party were everyone is happy, dancing, and having a good time. Then show the police rapping.''
|-
!Blubs
|''(Singing karaoke:)'' What up, fools. It's Blubs and Durls.
|-
!Deputy Durland
|''(Singing karaoke:)'' Making all that money and gettin' them girls!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Talking to the crowd of the party:)'' What do you say guys is this party legendary? When I say "Mabel" you say "Pines"!

!Wendy
|Whoa, WHOA! I think it's an earthquake! ''(Blows airhorn)'' Hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!
|-
!Candy
|We are all doomed!
|-
!Grenda
|Quick, into my getaway pouch.
|-
!
|''Candy jumps into Grenda's backpack.''
|-
!Grenda
|Mabel, escape while you still can!
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, no! Don't leave! We haven't even done our family karaoke song yet!

!
|''Dipper runs into the party (Soos and Mabel are the only ones left). Mabel notices the zombies following Dipper.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, what's the one thing I asked you not to do tonight?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sounding ashamed:)'' Raise the dead.
|-
!Mabel
|And what did you do?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sounding ashamed:)'' Raise the dead.
|-
!
|''As the zombies get closer, Mabel and Dipper back up as Soos heroically steps in front to protect them.''
|-
!Soos
|Stay back dudes, this is about to get intense.
|-
!
|''Zombie knocks over a table, forcing them into a dead end, as the zombies surround them''

!All
|''(Scream)''
|-
!Soos
|Sorry, one second. ''(Takes out his phone and takes a picture)'' You got to admit this is pretty cool.
|-
!
|(Commercial break)
|-
!Dipper
|ZOMBIES!!
|-
!Mabel
|Don't panic. Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob?!
|-
!
|''A zombie swings and almost hits their heads before they duck. They run behind Soos while screaming.''
|-
!Soos
|Dudes, stay calm. I've been training for this moment my whole life. With all the horror movies I've seen, I literally know all there is to know about to avoid zombies.
|-
!
|''A zombie bites Soos, and he becomes a zombie.''
|-
!Soos
|Second thought, gonna flip the script. Can I, eat your brains? Yea or Nay? Seeing some Yea faces over here.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Scream)''
|-
!
|''They run around the side of the house, Soos and the other zombies in slow pursuit. Dipper slices through a zombie with his shovel.''
|-
!Dipper
|Quick! The golf cart!
|-
!
|''Zombies attack the golf cart, tipping it over and biting at it.''
|-
!Dipper
|Aw, come on!
|-
!Soos
|Hoo, that's a bummer. Good news for me though, ha ha.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos!
|-
!Soos
|Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains!
|-
!Dipper
|Stay back!
|-
!
|''Dipper hits a colorful disco ball at the zombies. One of the zombies catches it in its mouth and swallows it, sending rays of colorful light shining out between its ribs. They continue advancing toward the twins, who stand in fear.''
|-
!Soos
|Give it up, dudes! Your fighting only makes us look more rad!
|-
!Mabel
|What do we do? Where's Grunkle Stan?
|-
!Dipper
|How's he supposed to help? He doesn't even believe in the supernatural!
|-
!
|''Cut to the secret lab, the portal glowing and making a zapping noise. Stan is in his chair, pushing buttons.''
|-
!Stan
|Those agents could ruin everything. Darn kid! He has no idea what he's messing with. ''(He picks up [[Journal 1]])'' He's stubborn, that's his problem. ''(Looks at his face reflected in the cover)'' Sorta like me, I suppose. ''(Puts the journal down)'' Ugh, I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now. All right, let's see...
|-
!
|''A screen behind him shows Dipper, Mabel, and Waddles running from the zombies. Cut to outside. A zombie pops up in front of the twins.''
|-
!Mabel
|Take that, sucka! ''(She hits the zombie with the karaoke machine. Its head flies off)'' This thing's a surprisingly good weapon!
|-
!
|''More zombies approach behind them. The kids scream and run into the Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|Quick! We need to board up all the windows!
|-
!
|''They pile things in front of the door, blocking it. The zombies press against the door and begin to break it.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(While backing up:)'' Okay, maybe that'll hold 'em.
|-
!
|''The window crashes open. Soos leans in.''
|-
!Soos
|Hey dudes! By the way, I taught the zombies how to get into the fuse box. Among these dudes I'm like a genius, haha!
|-
!
|''The Shack lights go out, with red light pouring in from outside. Zombies start climbing in through the window.''
|-
!Soos
|Get those brains, dawg!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs for the other door, just as a zombie hand smashes through. He gasps and backs into the corner with Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Frantically looking through the journal:)'' NO! THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT WEAKNESSES! ''(Sighs)'' This can't be happening. I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger. Now we're toast, it's all my fault, and no one can save us!
|-
!
|''A zombie grabs Dipper's arm and lifts him up. Mabel screams.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah, NO! MABEL, I'M SORRY!
|-
!Mabel
|DIPPER!
|-
!
|''Dipper screams, the zombie opens it's mouth, when suddenly—"SMASH!"—it is hit with a baseball bat and drops Dipper, and its head is crushed by the foot of—''

!Stan
|''(Standing in a heroic stance, panting, his clothes torn and hat gone. Gesturing to the twins:)'' YOU TWO! ATTIC! NOW!
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle... Grunkle Stan?!
|-
!Stan
|I said NOW! ''(As Dipper, Mabel, and Waddles flee and the zombies approach:)'' All right, you undead jerks, YOU READY TO DIE TWICE?!
|-
!
|''The twins run through the living room, Stan following, fighting off zombies.''
|-
!Stan
|The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me! Take that! And that!
|-
!Stan
|Eat it, no eyes! ''(A zombie growls and bites the baseball bat in half, only be punched by Stan's brass-knuckle-wearing fists)'' ANYONE ELSE WANNA PIECE?!
|-
!
|''He continues bashing zombies, then backs up the stairs as more enter from the front door. At the top of the stairs he pushes over a grandfather clock with a grunt, sending it tumbling into the horde of zombies. The twins run into their room and slam the door. They back away as something starts breaking in. The door opens to reveal Stan, who coughs and clutches his side.''
|-
!Stan
|Oh! Ow. Everything hurts. ''(He turns and closes the door, barricading it with a chair)''

!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, that was amazing! Are you alright! Heh heh, well, at least you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?
|-
!Stan
|''(Pause)'' Kid, I've always known.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, what are you talking about?
|-
!Stan
|I'm not an idiot, Dipper! Of course this town is weird! And the one thing I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous! ''(A zombie's hand breaks through the door. The group backs into the center of the room)'' I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it. To try to protect you from it!
|-
!
|''A zombie breaks through the window. Stan punches it and watches it fall to the ground, where a crowd of zombies is staring up at the Shack. More start crawling up the outside walls.''
|-
!Stan
|It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
|-
!Mabel
|What do we do, what do we do?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pacing across the room)'' Well, normally the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies! ''(He pauses by a black light, and it glows on the journal, revealing glowing text)'' It's hopeless!
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, wait, wait! The text! It's glowing in the black light!
|-
!Dipper
|What? ''(He flips through the journal, with Mabel and Grunkle Stan watching. The pages are covered with previously hidden notes)'' All this time I thought I knew all the journal's secrets, but they're written in some kind of invisible ink!
|-
!Stan
|Invisible ink?
|-
!Dipper
|This is it! ''(Reading:)'' "Zombies have a weakness! Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony." Three part harmony, how can we create that? I have a naturally high-pitched scream...?
|-
!Stan
|I can make noises with my body? Sometimes intentionally.
|-
!Mabel
|Boys, boys. I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
|-
!
|''Cut to the zombies outside crowding the Mystery Shack. They wander through the gift shop, when a noise comes from a microphone.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Through mic:)'' Hello? Hello? Is this thing on?
|-
!
|''The zombies start walking outside. Soos walks through the living room.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Notices TV)'' Ooh, ''Gossiping Housewives'' is on! ''(He sits to watch. A zombie calls him from outside)'' Eh, I already sat down.
|-
!
|''The zombies gather outside. Dipper, Grunkle Stan, and Mabel are on the roof awning, each holding a microphone.''
|-
!Mabel
|Zombies and gentlemen! I'm Mabel, they're Dipper and Stan, and together we're Love Patrol Alpha!
|-
!Dipper
|I never agreed to that name.
|-
!Mabel
|Hit it!
|-
!
|''"Taking Over Midnight" starts playing.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at lyrics)'' Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Singing:)'' "Friday night, and we're gonna party 'til dawn. Don't worry, Daddy, ''(questioningly)'' I've got my favorite dress on?!" ''(Covers mic)'' Mabel, this is stupid!
|-
!Mabel
|<i>(Singing:)</i> "Roll in to the party, the boys are lookin' our way. We just keep dancing', we don't care what they say!" ''(Zombies start crawling up the roof)'' "And all the boys are gettin' up in my face–" ''(A zombie grabs at them)'' Aah! Guys, we have to sing together or it won't work!"
|-
!Stan
|''(Singing:)'' "Boys are a bore, let's show 'em the door."
|-
!All three
|''(Singing:)'' "We're takin' over the dance floor! Oh-oh! Girls do what we like!"
|-
!
|''A sound wave goes out, causing the zombies to cover their ears. A few of their heads explode.''
|-
!All three
|''(Singing:)'' "Oh-oh! We're taking over tonight! Oh-oh! Girls do what we like! Oh-oh! We're taking over tonight!"
|-
!
|''They sing to the night as more zombies' heads explode.''
|-
!All three
|''(Singing:)'' "We're queens of the disco! Oh-oh! Girls do what we like! Oh-oh! We're taking over tonight!"
|-
!Dipper
|''(Singing:)'' "Takin' over tooniiiiight!"
|-
!
|''As the guitar riff plays, a zombie pops up and Dipper screams.''
|-
!Mabel
|DUCK! ''(Shoots it with confetti cannon. Its head lands in the punch bowl as the rising sun illuminates the corpses of all the zombies)'' Thank you! We'll be here all night!
|-
!Stan
|Deal with it, zombie idiots! ''(Laughs maniacally)''
|-
!All
|''(Chant:)'' PINES! PINES! PINES! PINES!
|-
!
|''Cut to the ravaged living room. Stan puts on his fez.''
|-
!Dipper
|I'm sorry about this, guys. I totally ruined everything.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, are you kidding me? I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world! No party could ever top that.
|-
!Stan
|Kids, listen. This town is crazy. So you need to be careful. I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch. I'll let you hold on to that spooky journal, as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense, and not go looking for trouble.
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.
|-
!Stan
|''(Crosses his fingers behind his back)'' Promise.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Crosses his fingers behind his back as well) Promise.''
|-
!Stan
|Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up. Where's my handyman anyway?
|-
!Soos
|Brains! Braaains!
|-
!Stan
|Holy Moses! ''(Grabs a chair, almost hits Zombie Soos)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait! There's a page in here about curing zombification. It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
|-
!Mabel
|Ooh, and cinnamon!
|-
!Dipper
|Come on Soos, let's fix you up.
|-
!Soos
|Brains! Braaains!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Prodding Soos out of the room)'' Soos, cut it out!
|-
!Soos
|Heheh, sorry dude!
|-
!Dipper
|I can't believe it! All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight! ''(Pulls out a [[Dipper's black light|portable black light]] and shines it on the journal)'' A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore...
|-
!
|''Cut to end credits.''
|-
!
|''Agents Powers and Trigger climbs out of a ditch''
|-
!Trigger
|That was insane! I've never seen anything like it! Who do we report to?
|-
!Powers
|''(Pulls a zombie head off his jacket and watches it dissolve in his hand)'' This is bigger than we imagined. We need to bring in the big guns.
|-
!Trigger
|But they'll never believe us!
|-
!Powers
|Then we'll ''make'' them believe us. This is the town we've been searching for.
|-
!
|''Toby walks by, swinging for a piñata and making weird noises.''
|-
!Trigger
|Aah! Another zombie!
|-
!Powers
|Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon!
|-
!
|''Toby lifts his blindfold and looks at the agents.''
|-
!Agents
|Oh, it's just—Who is that guy?—just a very ugly man.

|''Episode starts at [[Corduroy cabin|Wendy's house]], where [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] are watching [[Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!]]''
|-
!Trixandra
|What do we do, Chadley? I thought they were dead!
|-
!Chadley
|Far worse, Trixandra! They're... Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!
|-
!Trixandra
|''(Screams)''
|-
!Dipper Pines
|Man, these movies are a lot less scary when you actually fought [[The Undead|real zombies]].
|-
!Wendy Corduroy
|''(To the TV:)'' They're slow! Just power-walk away from them!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pokes Wendy with his elbow)'' How much you want to bet that guy dies first?
|-
!TV
|''(Chomping noise)''
|-
!Chadley
|Aah! My face is being eaten a lot!
|-
!Wendy and Dipper
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Wendy
|Chadley ain't pretty no more.
|-
!
|''(Wendy's phone buzzes)''
|-
!Wendy
|One second. ''(Grabs phone)'' Ugh, another text from [[Robbie Valentino|Robbie]]!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, yeah! Robbie. How's, uh, how's all that going? ''(Making circles with his finger)''
|-
!Wendy
|Ugh, I'm over him, I just wish he was over me! Just look at these texts. ''(Shows Dipper her phone)'' Winky frown? What does that even mean?
|-
!Dipper
|And you're not... ''(Cough)'' not like, seeing any other guys or...
|-
!Wendy
|Of course I am, meet my new boyfriend, dude. ''(Hugs plush walrus)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Laughs)'' Right, right. ''(Nervous laugh)'' So, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to maybe if, you know, you and me, whatever. I mean if maybe you ''(Grimaces)'' wanted to join me and Mabel on this mystery hunt? Tomorrow? Conspiracy stuff and all that?
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, dude. I love doing all that junk with friends. ''(To TV:)'' Yo Chadley, watch out!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, that's what we are. ''(Looks at a note he had written about confessing his crush on Wendy)'' That's all we'll ever be. ''(Crumples it up, lies back on Wendy's bed)'' Friends.
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, you're laying on my bra.
|-
!Dipper
|Hu—? ''(Screams)''
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!
|''Workmen are fixing up the nearly destroyed [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|Hey, easy with that, it's genuine plastic! And repave the cracks in the parking lot while you're at it! ''(Looking into chasm)'' I don't want [[Stanmobile|my car]] falling into China!
|-
!Workman
|Mr. Pines, what exactly caused all this damage? I need to write a report.
|-
!Stan
|Uhhh, big woodpecker.
|-
!
|''Gift shop sign falls over.''
|-
!Stan
|Keep the change. ''(Stuffs several bills into the workman's front pocket)'' ...I'm winking under my eye patch.
|-
!Workman
|Works for me.
|-
!Stan
|''(Lifts his eye patch, looks around)'' Now where'd those kids run off to?
|-
!
|''(Dipper, [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], and [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] are standing around the tree that contained [[Journal 3]])''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Taps a pen on his lantern)'' Thank you all for coming.
|-
!Mabel Pines
|Hey, when there's a mystery, you can count on your sister...-Ey.
|-
!Soos Ramirez
|''(Laughs)'' That's an amazing rhyme. When you want some, good... When you need a Soos, you... Oh oh, gosh, I don't know.
|-
!Dipper
|We're here to solve the number one mystery in [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]; who wrote this journal?! Thirty years ago the author vanished without a trace. But according to this new clue, ''(Turns on [[Dipper's black light|portable black light]])'' we may have found his secret hiding place. ''(The black light reveals hidden drawings on the page)'' We find that author, we learn the answers to everything. We just need to figure out a way to get down there.
|-
!Wendy
|Chop it down, dudes! ''(Arrives on bike, rings bell)''
|-
!Mabel
|Wendy!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, hey! You came.
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, I'm so stoked about this. I've been wanting to go adventuring with you guys. Sure beats picking up after my dad at home.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Manly Dan]] at home.''
|-
!Manly Dan
|''(Repeatedly hits his head on the low ceiling and knocks down a beam)'' Ow!, Ow! Ow! Who put that wall there? Ow!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the gang.''
|-
!Wendy
|Thanks for the invite, man!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flustered:)'' Of course, anytime you wanna.. I, we're always... Us.
|-
!Mabel
|Uh oh! ''(Pokes Dipper)'' Inviting Wendy on our mission? Me thinks there's romance afoot!
|-
!Dipper
|No, look I've thought this through and I'm over Wendy. I've looked at it from every angle, and that thing was going nowhere. I know what matters to me now, and it's finding the author of this journal.
|-
!Mabel
|Hah! YOU'RE over Wendy?! Allow me to put on my "skepticals." ''(Makes circles around her eyes with her fingers)'' Whooop!
|-
!Dipper
|I've moved on, Mabel. You should too.
|-
!Mabel
|Skepticals...
|-
!Wendy
|Hey, is it just me, or does that branch kinda look like a lever?
|-
!
|''Dipper turns his back on the tree. Wendy uses her belt to start climbing up the tree.''
|-
!Dipper
|Huh, yeah. But how do we get up there...? It seems we'd need like a ladder, or like, ladder shoes... Yeah, ladder shoes. I'll get Soos to draw up a prototype.
|-
!Wendy
|''(At the lever-branch now, pulls an ax out of her belt, swings it around and hits the lever)'' Boosh.
|-
!Soos
|Whoa ho-ho!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Wow!
|-
!Wendy
|Oh yeah, my dad used to make me compete in these lumberjack games when I was a kid. Guess I kinda ruled at it.
|-
!
|''The tree begins shaking. Three crows fly away.''
|-
!Wendy
|Whoa, what is that? ''(Falls down, screaming)''
|-
!
|''At the bottom, the ground and tree sink down, taking Wendy with it. The others pull her out before she falls in. They stand around it as a staircase to the middle of the tree appears, and subsequently a door inside the tree opens.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright guys, this is it. Remember, whatever happens down there, we tell no one.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gives thumbs up)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Turns hat backwards)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Zips her lips)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holds up a lantern)'' Now, who wants to go first?
|-
!All
|''(Walk down the staircase and into a [[bunker|room]])''
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|Whoa!
|-
!Dipper
|Cool!
|-
!Wendy
|This is so, stupid cool!
|-
!Dipper
|It's like a fallout shelter or something. It must've belonged to the author.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Takes the Fallout Shelter poster off the wall and dusts it off)'' This is going over my bed.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Puts face in a barrel and comes out with caterpillars on her face)'' Haha! My face feels fuzzy!
|-
!Dipper
|This is incredible! It's like he was preparing for a disaster. But what kinda disaster would need supplies for over sixty years? ''(Looks up a shelf with dated boxes, the highest labeled 2070)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Opens weapons locker)'' Oh my gosh! A [[Smez]] despenser! I remember these things. What's that, yes I will have some of your old-timey face food. ''(Eats candy from dispenser)'' Ew, dusty! ''(Eats a second piece)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holding dripping [[Baron Num Nums High Flyin' Beans|bean can]])'' Wait guys, I think this can was opened recently.
|-
!Soos
|The author might still be alive, down here!
|-
!Wendy
|Wait a minute... ''(Wendy pulls it down a map of Gravity Falls from 1982, revealing an open hatch cover)'' I think I know where he might have gone... ''(Leads everyone in crawling through the tunnel)'' Whoa! ''(Leads into a room made of metal cubes)'' Whoa! Oh, man! Was this place built in the past or the future?
|-
!Soos
|This room is way creepy.
|-
!Mabel
|Not as creepy as Dipper's internet history! Heyo! ''(Shoves Dipper, and he steps on the square with the design and it depresses, causing the hatch to slam and lock. The symbols on the other wall squares glow red, a buzzer sounds and the room starts to shake. Some squares start to poke into the room)''
|-
!Soos
|What's goin' on, dude?
|-
!All
|''(Pressing up against wall, beginning to panic)''
|-
!Mabel
|Haha, it's hard to be scared with caterpillars on your face. Wall things! Crazy wall things happening right now!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Tries to push the blocks back in)'' It won't stop!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! What do we do?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flips frantically through the journal and stops at a page labeled "Security Room." He shines the blacklight on it)'' Oh, come on! ''(Shows them a page with symbol on it)'' Find these four symbols! Quick! Everybody step on one!
|-
!Soos
|One! ''(Pushes symbol)''
|-
!Wendy
|Two! ''(Punches symbol)''
|-
!Mabel
|Three! ''(Jumps over and slaps the symbol)''
|-
!Dipper
|Four! ''(Climbs up blocks and taps symbol; a door opens on the other side of the room)''
|-
!Mabel
|Run for it!
|-
!All
|''(Run out; Dipper's vest get caught in the block, he slips out)''
|-
!Wendy
|Yes! Yes! That was, huh, that was nuts! ''(To Dipper:)'' You ruled back there, man!
|-
!Dipper
|Haha, thanks.
|-
!Wendy
|Get a load of this crazy Surveillance Room.
|-
!Soos
|Check it out dudes! ''(Makes faces with beakers in front)''
|-
!Wendy
|Soos, Soos... That is hilarious.
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Dipper:)'' Hey bro, you forgot your vest. ''(Walks over to Dipper's vest and pulls it out, causing the note fall to the floor)'' What the..? ''(Reading aloud:)'' "Dear Wendy, I've always had a crush on..." ''(Gasps and covers her mouth with the note. Excitedly, to herself:)'' OHMYGOSH! ''(To Dipper:)'' Hey. Dipper! Look what I found...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)'' What did you...? Give me that! ''(Snatches it)''
|-
!Mabel
|I know it! I know it! I know it! You're not over Wendy at all! ''(Gasps)'' And you were gonna tell her today?
|-
!Dipper
|No, I changed my mind; it's a bad idea. I'd embarrass myself and then I'd be another guy she hates, like Robbie.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, you should just tell her already. One way or another, you'll feel better afterwards.
|-
!Dipper
|Look, Mabel, I can't tell her no matter how much I want to, so just drop it OK?
|-
!Wendy
|Dude! Dipper, you gotta check out this weird metal closet. ''(Robot voice:)'' I am a robot, I have a metal closet.
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Wendy:)'' Coming! ''(To Mabel:)'' This never happened.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Thinking:)'' He wants to tell her but he's scared; maybe he needs a little push. Good idea, Mabel. Thanks, Mabel! ''(Runs and hugs Dipper. Speaking:)'' Brother, whatever happens I just you need to know something: this is for your own good. 
|-
!Dipper
|What? 
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shoves him into the closet with Wendy and shuts it)''
|-
!Dipper
|What the-? ''(Looks at Wendy, gasps and pounds on the door)'' MABEL! Let us out!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, I'll let you out Dipper, as soon as you tell Wendy that thing you've been wanting to tell her! You'll thank me for this later!
|-
!Wendy
|What is she talking about?
|-
!Dipper
|Nothing! Mabel's just been eating raw sugar packets again.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Eating raw sugar packets)'' Om nom... That's besides the point!
|-
!Dipper
|Let me out RIGHT NOW! ''(Pounds on the door)''
|-
!Wendy
|Uh! Where are the lights? ''(Pulls cord)''
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|AHHH!
|-
!
|''Water gushes down, followed by a blast of hot air that pushes them together. A red light flashes and a tone sounds. A sign reading "Decontamination Complete" flashes and doors open on a wrecked underground room.''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! A hidden lab! Maybe the author did experiments down here.
|-
!Wendy
|Huh. What do you think dug all these tunnels?
|-
!Dipper
|Lets hope we don't find out. ''(Hears a growling sound, screams and runs as a dark figure approaches)'' Mabel, open up, for real! There's a monster in here!
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha, nice try! The only monsters are your own inner demons, Dipper!
|-
!Soos
|That is so wise.
|-
!Wendy
|Dipper, just say whatever Mabel wants you to say, so she'll let us out of here!
|-
!Mabel
|Come on Dipper! Now's the time, bro!
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy, I— I— I'm gonna find another way out! ''(Grabs Wendy's hand and pulls her in the other direction)''
|-
!Wendy
|Wait, what? Dude, where are we going? ''(They run down a tunnel and the thing corners them there)'' What do we do?
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know! ''(They watch as the shadows of a man and the creature fight)''
|-
!Unknown Man
|Back, back you heinous beast! ''(Walks forward into view)'' Well, I just ripped out a monster's tongue. ''(Throws it down on the ground in front of them)''
|-
!Dipper
|It's, it's you!
|-
!Unknown Man
|Hurry now, I scared it off, but it'll regenerate. ''(Leads them down the tunnel)'' I wasn't expecting guests. I've been down here for a very long time. Years! Weeks, maybe! I miss orange juice.
|-
!Dipper
|You don't understand, you're the guy I've been looking for!
|-
!Wendy
|He's the guy?
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy, he's the guy!
|-
!Unknown Man
|The guy?
|-
!Dipper
|I've got like a gillion questions! Why did you write the journals? Who was after you? Why did you build this bunker?
|-
!Unknown Man
|Heh. My boy I'd love to discuss this in time. We have more pressing matters. ''(All begin to walk around the lab)'' It's one of my experiments, a [[Shape Shifter|shape shifter]]. Able to take the form of anyone or anything it sees. It broke free from a cage of solid steel! I've gone half crazy trying to catch the creature alone. But now you're here! Will you help me catch it? ''(Lifts goggles)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps in excitement)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Soos exploring the other room.''
|-
!Soos
|Sure are taking their time in there. ''(Slips on lab coat, and picks up [[laptop]])'' Hey, do I look smarter with this coat and brief case? I feel like I look smarter...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Razzle dazzle! Look at this tube-y thing! ''(Pressing button on dashboard)'' Frozen! Unfrozen! Frozen! Unfrozen! What's this? Experiment number 210: the shape shifter.
|-
!Soos
|The shape shifter? Uh, dude? Didn't Dipper say there was a monster in there with them?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' I thought he was just joking!
|-
!Soos
|YOU KNOW DIPPER'S JOKES ARE TERRIBLE!
|-
!Mabel
|DIPPER!!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Dipper, Wendy, and the Unknown Man, still in the lab.''
|-
!Unknown Man
|Come in, come in! I apologize for the state of things! I don't get many non mole-people visitors. Now the beast must have some weakness we can exploit. I just wish I had my research on me. But alas, I lost my journals so many years ago.
|-
!Wendy
|Did you say journals?
|-
!Dipper
|Dude! I found one of them! That's how I tracked you down here. ''(Pulls out journal)''
|-
!Unknown Man
|What?! Could it be? ''(Takes journal from Dipper)'' My boy! I can't express my gratitude! ''(Flips through pages of the journal)''
Oh yes, after all these years...
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Soos running in to the other room, both are panting.''
|-
!Soos
|Wendy?! Oh, it's so dark! How will we ever find them?
|-
!Mabel
|Leave that to Mabel! ''(Presses light bulb on sweater)''
|-
!Soos
|Whoa, rad! Although, isn't electric clothing kinda like a fire hazard?
|-
!Mabel
|No. It's a fun hazard. Now let me light the way! ''(Runs off with Soos following behind)''
|-
!Soos
|We're coming for you dudes!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Wendy, Dipper, and the Unknown Man, who is skimming through the pages of the journal.''
|-
!Unknown Man
|''(To himself)'' Yes, yes. It's all here.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Whispering to Wendy, as she picks up a can of beans)'' Wendy! Isn't it amazing we're actually meeting the real author?
|-
!Wendy
|''(Gasps and bites lip. Holding out the can to Dipper. Whispering:)'' Dipper! Look! ''(Shows him a can of beans with a picture of "the author" on it)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Man:)'' Uhh, you know what? We should probably get going. Can I have my journal back?
|-
!Unknown Man
|''(Blinks eyes sideways and turns head all the way around. voice deepening:)'' You're not going anywhere. ''(Crawls up wall and turns into "true form")''
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Laughs)'' How do you like my true form? Go on, admit it, you like it!
|-
!Dipper
|You! What did you do to the real author?!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|You'll likely never find out. That [[Ford Pines|six-fingered nerd]] hasn't been himself in thirty years! But I thank you for bringing me his journal. He used to write it while I was in my cage. So many wonderful forms to take! ''(Flipping through the journal, it transforms into the [[Gremloblin]], a [[gnomes|gnome]], and then the [[Hide Behind]], laughing each time)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Whispering to Wendy:)'' We've gotta get that journal back!
|-
!Wendy
|Hey body snatcher! ''(Picks up can of beans and throws at shape shifter)'' Snatch this!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Dodges it, turns into a giant frog monster, and lashes its tongue out at Wendy)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Holds up a piece of metal to block the tongue, making it drop the journal)''
|-
!Dipper
|RUN! RUN! RUN!
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|''(Run through tunnels)''
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Chasing them while taking several forms, then turns into a giant rolly polly monster and chases them to a fork in the tunnels)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Throws his flashlight down one end and runs with Wendy down the other end. They crash into Soos and Mabel)''
|-
!All
|''(Greet each other excitedly)''

!Dipper
|''(To Soos and Mabel:)'' Wait! How do we know they're not the shape shifter?
|-
!Soos
|Maybe I am! Mabel, inspect my shape! ''(Pulls up shirt)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pokes Soos' stomach)'' Poke!
|-
!Soos
|''(Laughs)'' Do that again!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pokes Soos' stomach again)'' Poke!
|-
!Soos
|''(Laughs once more)'' Even better the second time!
|-
!Dipper
|It's definitely them. ''(Gasps)'' Oh my gosh, Wendy, you're bleeding!
|-
!Wendy
|It's cool, it's cool. It's just blood man; don't freak out.
|-
!Mabel
|What happened?
|-
!Wendy
|We got attacked by the shape shifter. ''(Taking off her shirt, and rips off a sleeve to cover the injury)'' He broke out of his cage, pretended to be the author, and wants Dipper's journal.
|-
!Dipper
|Imagine if he escapes to the town! He can transform into anything! We could never trust anyone ever again!
|-
!Mabel
|What do we do?!
|-
!Wendy
|Well, he took us into his home, tricked us, and tried to destroy us. I say we return the favor.
|-
!
|''Cut to a different tunnel. The shape shifter returns to its human form.''
|-
!Shape Shifter
|Dipper, my boy! Come out! ''(Momentarily loses its form)'' I must speak with you! ''(Turns into a creature with six legs, claws, and a one-eyed head resembling a hand)'' REVEAL YOURSELF, YOU SINGLE-FORMED HUMAN WEAKLING! ''(Slams its head into the ground)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Entering the room with Dipper)'' Oh boy, Dipper. That book sure is full of some great monsters!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|There you are! Ooh, and a new one. ''(Turns into Mabel)'' Should I be one... ''(Turns into Dipper)'' ...or the other? How about both!? ''(Turns into a six-legged creature. The top half resembles Dipper while the bottom half resembles Mabel. Both halves have a large mouth with many sharp teeth. Roars)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''They scream and run away as the shape shifter chases them. They enter a room with Wendy and Soos holding onto the valve of a pipe)''
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, he's coming! He's coming! NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!!
|-
!Wendy and Soos
|''(Start turning the valve)''
|-
!Soos
|It's not working, dude!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Catches up to them and tries to grab Dipper's journal with its tongue)''
|-
!Dipper
|HEY, LET GO!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Helps Dipper)'' You leave him alone!
|-
!
|''Wendy is pulled away with the journal. Dipper is left behind.''
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy!
|-
!
|''Wendy jumps on the shape shifter and prepares to attack it with her ax. Soos successfully turns the valve and a strong stream of water bursts from the pipe. Wendy and the shape shifter are knocked back by the water. Dipper, Mabel and Soos get caught in the flow as well. Wendy hits a rock under the water, then the water subsides.''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel & Soos
|''(Gasp for air)''
|-
!
|''The water drains out''.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks up Wendy's ax)'' WENDY!! ''(Voice echoes, follows the tunnel and finds Wendy laying on the ground)'' Wendy! No, no, no-no-no! Can you hear me? Oh, please be okay, please be okay! ''(Shakes her, with no response)'' Oh no, oh no! This is all my fault! If I had told you when we were in the closet we wouldn't be in this mess. But I was too scared and now you could be hurt or worse, and I never even got to tell you I'm, like—In love with you, Wendy! ''(Tears up and buries face in hands)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Standing behind Dipper)'' Uh, Dipper?
|-
!Dipper
|Huh—wha—Wendy?! W-wait, then who's...?
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Gets up and growls)''
|-
!Dipper
|LOOK OUT!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Attacks Wendy, in Wendy's voice)'' Give me back that journal!
|-
!Wendy
|Never!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Pushes her over and lands on her)''
|-
!Wendy
|Get off me! ''(Kicks the shape shifter off)''
|-
!
|''The two Wendys fight while Dipper watches. It is unclear which is the shape shifter. Dipper picks up the ax and approaches them.''
|-
!Wendy
|Give it back; it belongs to Dipper! ''(To Dipper:)'' Hit her with the ax!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|Don't listen to her, Dipper!
|-
!Wendy
|She's the shape shifter!
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, uh, I don't know who's who! Give me a sign!
|-
!Shape Shifter

|''(Roars and returns to its true form)''

!
|''The tube that Mabel froze and unfroze earlier flashes "READY." The shape shifter rips the ax out of its body.''
|-
!Dipper
|Push him in!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Wendy push the shape shifter into the tube. The door closes and the tube begins freezing the shape shifter. The shot pulls back to show Mabel and Soos watching through a screen. Mabel has pressed the button to activate the tube.''
|-
!Mabel
|Frozen! ''(She and Soos fist-bump)'' Boop!
|-
!Soos
|Boosh!
|-
!Shape Shifter
|No! ''(Turns into a rock monster, then a flame monster, then the man from earlier)'' Let me ouuuut! ''(Returns to its true form and roars. It begins to freeze)''
|-
!
|''Mabel and Soos are now in the same room as Wendy, Dipper, and the shape shifter''
|-
!Soos
|Let's get out of here, dudes.
|-
!Shape Shifter
|''(Laughs evilly)''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Wendy and Soos
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Shape Shifter
|You think you're so clever don't you, Dipper? But you have no idea what you're up against. You will never find the author. If you keep digging, you'll meet a fate worse than you can imagine. And this will be the last form you ever take! ''(Turns into Dipper and [[Northwest Mansion Mystery|screams while being frozen]], while Dipper looks on in horror)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Laughs. To Dipper:)'' Good luck sleeping tonight!
|-
!
|''Cut to outside. The tree returns to it's default position''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, I think I'm kind of adventured out for a little while. My face hurts from doing this all day. ''(Makes a screaming face)''
|-
!Mabel
|(Laughs) Yeah, but you gotta admit we're all total heroes.
|-
!Soos
|''(Tousles Mabel's hair)'' Hey, who wants to get some heroes' breakfast, huh?
|-
!Mabel
|''(On Soos' shoulders)'' Syrup on cereal!
|-
!Soos
|Mabel, you're a visionary!
|-
!Dipper
|Look, Wendy, about earlier. In the heat of the moment, I might have said some dumb things, and can't we pretend none of that ever happened? Please?
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, dude. It's okay. I always kinda knew.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, you did?
|-
!Wendy
|''(Chuckles)'' Yeah man, you think I can't hear that stuff you're constantly whispering under your breath?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Groans)'' Oh man! ''(Sits down on a log)''
|-
!Wendy
|Listen Dipper, I'm like, super flattered, but... I'm too old for you. I mean, you know that, right?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Groans)'' Mabel said confessing would make me feel better.
|-
!Wendy
|Well, how do you feel?
|-
!Dipper
|Anxious. Scared. Kinda itchy.
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, don't be itchy man. Let me tell you something. This summer was super boring until you showed up. I have more fun with you than practically anybody else. And if you ever stopped being my friend, ... I would, like, throw myself into the [[Bottomless pit (place)|Bottomless Pit]]!
|-
!Dipper
|So things won't be too, awkward, now?
|-
!Wendy
|I just wrestled myself, dude. That was awkward. If you can handle that monster, you can handle a little awkwardness.
|-
!Dipper
|Friends?
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, dude! Friends! ''(Shoves him backwards off the log)''
|-
!
|''Both laugh, then Wendy pulls him back onto the log.''
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, and hey Dipper? See you for movie night tomorrow. Your place this time, okay? ''(Bikes away)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pops out of bushes)'' Sooo? How did it go?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Surprised:)'' Wha—what did you hear?
|-
!Mabel
|Everything! All the time!
|-
!Soos
|''(From in the bushes:)'' I'M NOT HERE!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, how can everything be so amazing and so terrible all at the same time?
|-
!Mabel
|I'm so sorry for being so pushy Dipper. If it's any consolation, I'm already working on your list of potential rebound crushes.
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks Mabel. Whoa!
|-
!Soos
|''(Sits down at other end of log)'' I'm still bummed we're no closer to finding the author guy. At least I got his science-y coat and briefcase. ''(Holds up laptop, which flops open)'' Whoa! What the?
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, that's not a briefcase, it's a laptop!
|-
!Mabel
|And a really busted up one too.
|-
!Soos
|I bet I could get this thing fixed up in a few days. It's gonna take a lotta duct tape.
|-
!Dipper
|This could be our next clue!

I've been waiting all morning and it's finally here! The [[Gravity Falls Gossiper]] accepted my article about summer fashion tips for squirrels. ''My'' picture is gonna be in the newspaper! Check it!

|''(Looking at the newspaper)'' Is it legal for a child to wear that much make-up?

|Go to the golf course after dark, you say? I don't know, we'd have to break in and-- Just kidding let's break in!!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan's car driving through the golf course's toll. Soos keeps watch while Stan pulls nails out of the fence. He removes a panel. Mabel hands him her sticker book and she and Dipper go through the hole.''

!Stan
|Oh, and hey, Mabel? ''(Sticks a "U DA BEST" sticker on Mabel's sweater)'' Knock her dead, kid.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gives a thumbs-up and goes inside. At the windmill, she is practicing, hitting a golf ball, which goes into the window, and comes to rest beside dozens of others, not in the hole.)'' Darn! Poop heck darn!

|Ugh, I don't get it! What is wrong with this hole? ''(Hears clanking inside the mill, backs away and gasps)'' Did you hear that?

|We good? We good? All right then! Hi, hello. I'm Franz, and welcome to our home!
|-
!Dipper
|What is this?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah! Are you guys tiny humans, or enormous mini-humans?
|-
!Franz
|''(laughs)'' Neither. We're Lilliputtians! Lilli- Lilliputt... the name makes more sense written down than spoken. And we control the balls! Behold!
|-
!
|''The side of the windmill opens, revealing a complex Rube Goldberg-ian convey system, with Lilliputtians turning cranks, pulling levers, and pushing turnstiles. A golf ball rolls out of the windmill into the hole.''
|-
!Mabel
|That's incredible!
|-
!Dipper
|And so needlessly complicated!
|-
!Franz
|Aw shucks. It's only our life-long passion. Would you like us to elaborate through song?
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians gather and prepare to sing.''
|-
!Dipper
|Eh, we're good.
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians groan in disappointment and disperse.''

|-

|We kind of have to play this golf tournament against my rival, Pacifica.

![[Lilliputtian pirate captain]]
|Put a clog in it, ya windmill-lubbers! ''(The pirate ship lights up. The Pirate Lilliputtians are looking over the deck.)'' These frilly bottom popinjays are terrible at controllin' the balls! ''(Draws sword) We'' are the ball masters, says I! Argh!

|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughing)'' Guys, guys, calm down! Your fighting is inadvertently adorable!
|-
!Franz
|''(Bruised and battered)'' Adorable we are, hugeling, but our tale less so. Every hole in the park thinks they're superior, from the cowboys in the east to the grimy miners of the south. If only there was some way to decide which side is best, with... maybe... an award, or, like a trophy, I dunno.
|-
!French Lilliputtian
|But Franz, look! ''(Points to Mabel's sticker)''
|-
!Franz
|The sticker. The sticker could decide!
|-
!French Lilliputtian
|It does say "Ze best" on it!
|-
!Lilliputtian head knight
|Decide for us, hugeling! Choose which mini-kingdom to give a sticker to, and end our war!
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians cheer.''
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, I don't know, guys. I'm not sure I wanna get involved in your weird mini-blood feud.
|-
!Dipper
|Pst! Mabel! This is perfect! These guys control the course! Just tell them you'll give the sticker to whichever group does a better job of helping us win!
|-
!Mabel
|I'm not sure, Dipper. I wanna beat Pacifica, but doesn't this seem like... cheating?
|-
!Dipper
|Pacifica's rich, Mabel. She's cheating at life.
|-
!Mabel
|Hmm...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Blows on a tiny trumpet)'' Thanks, man. ''(Returns it to a knight)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Standing on the castle)'' People of the eighteen holes! We're going to have a game of mini-golf! And whoever does the best job helping me win, gets the sticker!
|-
!Lilliputtian pirate captain
|It'll be us, lass. Not these tulip-munchers!
|-
!Franz
|I will not be insulted by a man with no depth perception wearing earrings!
|-
!Mabel
|Just remember, as long as you're helping me, no fighting.
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians look at each other and smile. Cut to the parking lot. Soos and Stan are in the car.''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, I'm cuttin' Ws into all my shirts. Gotta give the public what they want.
|-
!Stan
|Well, those kids are taking their time. Looks like it's gonna be a while. ''(Turns on the radio. Soos takes off his shirt to work on the neck. Stan leans back in his seat and sighs. He closes his eyes, then looks over at Soos, who, still shirtless, has reclined next to him.)''
|-
!Soos
|Sure are a lot of stars out tonight...
|-
!Stan
|''(Sits up.)'' Well, this is gettin' weird. ''(Leaves.)''
|-
!Preston Northwest
|''(The [[Northwest family's car|Northwest car]] pulls up.)'' But now remember, Pacifica, winning is everything.
|-
!Priscilla Northwest
|Oh, oh, and also looks. Winning and looks. ''(Looks at self in mirror.)''
|-
!Pacifica
|Dad, I've been practicing for, like, a million hours, okay? I've got this. You'll stay and watch, right?
|-
!Preston Northwest
|Pacifica, darling, we have a party to go to. We'll just read about your victory in the paper.
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Gets out of car.)'' Sergei! ''(Sergei climbs out of the trunk and gets the luggage.)''
|-
!Preston Northwest
|Oh, and whatever happens, just remember one thing. You're a Northwest. Don't lose. ''(Slams the door and the car drives away.)''
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Entering the park:)'' How much you wanna bet they're no-shows?
|-
!
|''A succession of lights flashes on, revealing Mabel and Dipper.''
|-
!Mabel
|Looking for someone?
|-
!Pacifica
|Waiting in the dark, not creepy at all. Seriously though, I don't know why you bothered to come. Unless you've got something up your sleeve.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, I guess you could say we've got a ''little'' something, right, right? ''(A Lilliputtian pops out of her sleeve. She shoves it back in, and she and Dipper laugh nervously.)''
|-
!Sergei
|Eighteen holes. Standard rules. Winner lives in glory, loser wallows in eternal shame. On your mark, get set, mini-golf!
|-
!
|''At the cowboy hole. Pacifica putts; the Lilliputtians block her ball with a covered wagon. Mabel putts, and the cowboys raise the grass to move her ball towards the hole. A cowboy shoots the ball, and it goes in. Mabel gives a thumbs-up, and the cowboys return the gesture before turning to mock the pirates. At the pirate hole. Mabel putts, and the pirates shoot her ball out of a cannon into the hole.''
|-
!Pacifica
|Out of my way! ''(Putts. Her ball shoots out the front and lands in her mouth.)'' Are you serious?!
|-
!
|''The pirates cheer, open a can of root beer, and raise their flag. At the miner hole. Mabel putts, and the ball goes down into the mine.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha, ha! Miner hole. I wonder what cute, silly things are going on down there.
|-
!
|''The ball rolls down a chute and two miners prepare to cart it into the mine.''
|-
!Prospector Lilliputtian
|Stop! You can't go in there! There's been a gas leak! Anyone who goes in there will DIE!!
|-
!
|''The miners look scared, then part as [[Big Henry]] approaches.''
|-
!Big Henry
|I'll take it.
|-
![[Polly]]
|Noooo! ''(Runs up to Big Henry.)'' Don't go, Big Henry! We need you!
|-
!Big Henry
|Go home, Polly.
|-
!
|''Big Henry pushes the cart into the mine, leaving the others staring after him. Sweating and breathing heavily, he trudges on through the seeping gas. Cut to the outside, where Mabel and Pacifica are waiting silently for the ball to reemerge. Pacifica checks her watch. Back in the mine. Big Henry slaps himself.''
|-
!Big Henry
|Come on, Big Henry. You can do this. ''(Reaches the end of the track and, struggling, pushes the button to send up the ball. He collapses beside the track, gasping, and pulls out a picture of him and Polly. His eyes fill with tears, smiles, and with a groan of satisfaction he dies peacefully.)''
|-
!
|''The ball rolls out of the mine and into the hole.''
|-
!Pacifica
|What?! ''(Throws her club, which Sergei catches.)'' Sergei! Soda! Now!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Lifts the lid of the mine hole.)'' Okay, guys? That was bedonkulous!
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, little hi-fives everyone, little hi-fives all around. ''(High-fives the miners with his finger)'' Nice one... You did it... You're the man.
|-
!Mabel
|I don't wanna call it out early, but I think the miners might have one of these in their future! ''(points to sticker. The miners cheer.)''
|-
!Franz
|''(Looking at them through a telescope from the windmill)'' Are you kidding me?! After everything we've worked for?
|-
!Dutch Lilliputtian
|Calm yourself, Franz. There may be another way to win the hugeling's favor. Knock on wood. ''(They knock on their clogs.)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Pacifica and Sergei. Sergei gets a Pitt cola from the vending machine.''
|-
!Pacifica
|There's something going on, Sergei. I can feel it.
|-
!Sergei
|Maybe they have little people who control where the balls go.
|-
!Pacifica
|Hoo, we gotta get you English lessons. I mean, think about it. I'm globally ranked. It's ridiculous that she's beating me. ''(A tiny figure darts behind a bush. Pacifica drinks the soda and spits out the pit)'' Ugh, [[Pitt Cola]]! I always forget about the pit. Get me a different one, Sergei. ''(A tiny hand taps her shoulder. She is grabbed and dragged into the bush.)''
|-
!Sergei
|This is bad.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel, tallying the scores.''
|-
!Dipper
|I can't wait to see the look on Pacifica's face when we win. I'm thinking it'll be like "ugh." ''(Makes face.)'' You know how she does that? "Ugh."
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, is it bad that I feel good about her feeling bad?
|-
!Dipper
|Ah, just enjoy your victory, Mabel. Trust me, Pacifica will be fine.
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Screams.)'' ''(She is tied in front of the windmill by the Dutch Lilliputtians.)'' What's going on here? Let me go!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Screams. The Lilliputtian peeps out of Mabel's sleeve.)''
|-
!Lilliputtian
|''(Screams.)'' What'd I miss?
|-
!Pacifica
|Let me go, you creeps!
|-
!Franz
|Welcome twins, welcome! I can tell you're loving this, right, right? No?
|-
!Mabel
|What are you guys doing?
|-
!Dipper
|This wasn't part of the deal, tiny Dutchman!
|-
!Franz
|Okay, so we saw you were favoring the miners, and we figured, what's better than beating Pacifica? ''(blows raspberry)'' Killing her, right?
|-
!Pacifica
|As if! I'm calling my parents. Where's my phone?
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians have taken it and are sending the message "U R DUMM!" to someone named Tiffany.''
|-
!Lilliputtian
|Hehe, send.
|-
!Pacifica
|Hey, hey!
|-
!Franz
|So how about it, hugeling? Who's da best now?
|-
!Lilliputtian pirate captain
|Not so fast land lubbers! ''(The pirates reveal that they have captured Sergei.)'' If you're going to play dirty, so are we. Now give us the sticker, or he walks the plank!
|-
!French Lilliputtian
|No! Give us ze sticker!
|-
!Miner Lilliputtians
|The miners! Give it to the miners!
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians all clamor, pressuring Mabel, until she screams-''
|-
!Mabel
|ENOUGH! ''(The Lilliputtians look at her. One peeks out of the duck's beak.)''
|-
!Mabel
|You know what? ''No'' one gets the sticker!
|-
!French Lilliputtian
|Sacre booo!
|-
!Lilliputtians
|''(Boo.)''
|-
!Mabel
|No, no. Nuh-uh. No booing- stop, no! No one gets the sticker cuz you're all being jerks! I mean, why can't you all just get along?
|-
!
|''Beat.''
|-
!Dutch Lilliputtian
|Because we hate each other.
|-
!Lilliputtian pirate captain
|That's kind of how rivalries work, lass.
|-
!Mabel
|Well then, maybe... maybe rivalries are dumb. Maybe you don't settle them with petty competitions. Maybe the only way to be "da best" is by ending the fighting and working together! ''(Rips off the sticker and eats it angrily. The Lilliputtians gasp and converse.)''
|-
!Dutch Lilliputtian
|It's all so clear.
|-
!Franz
|If we work together...
|-
!Lilliputtian pirate captain
|Then we can cut open her belly and get the sticker! ''(All cheer and rush forward.)''
|-
!French Lilliputtian
|Get ze girl! Slice her open!
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, you guys aren't appreciating the lesson here!
|-
!
|''A lever is pulled near Pacifica, and she starts being pulled toward the whirring blades of the windmill. She screams.''
|-
!Dipper
|We gotta get out of here!
|-
!Mabel
|I have to save Pacifica first! ''(Climbs a lamp post, followed by the swarm of Lilliputtians. She swings along a chain of lights and lands by the windmill, evading the golf pencil spears thrown by the crowd.)''
|-
!Sergei
|''(About to fall off the plank:)'' Ah, Mister Dipper! ???, ???! ''(pronounced as "Niet, niet!"; Russian for "No, no!")''
|-
!Dipper
|Don't freak out, man! The water's shallow! There's literally no way to drown!
|-
!Sergei
|''(Falls in face first.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Seriously?
|-
!Pacifica
|''(As Mabel unties her:)'' Ugh, took you long enough, And watch the earrings. They're worth more than your house.
|-
!Mabel
|You know, on second thought, maybe I won't untie you.
|-
!Pacifica
|Untie me! Untie me!
|-
!Mabel
|That's what I thought. ''(Pulls Pacifica free and grabs a golf club.)''
|-
!Lilliputtian pirate captain
|We have you at miniature pencil point! There's no way around us!
|-
!Mabel
|You ready to putt?
|-
!Pacifica
|Way ahead of you. ''(Grabs her club and they start swinging at the Lilliputtians.)'' You know, you're actually not that terrible. A little rusty, but-
|-
!Mabel
|Just shut up and putt!
|-
!
|''The Lilliputtians are hit out of the way. Dipper and Sergei show up driving a golf cart.''
|-
!Dipper
|Get on, get on!
|-
!Mabel
|Gun it! ''(They drive away.)''
|-
!Lilliputtian pirate captain
|Don't let them escape!
|-
!
|''The golf cart heads for the exit. The knights cut a string, releasing a pair of swinging axes in front of the gate. Dipper hits the gas and they zoom through. They go around a loop-de-loop and Sergei falls off.''
|-
!Sergei
|Sergei overboard!
|-
!Pacifica
|I'll get a new one.
|-
!Dipper
|They're shutting us in! ''(Lilliputtians poke holes through the cart. Mabel climbs on the roof.)''
|-
!Franz
|Don't even think about it. You call yourself a golfer? Without us, that club is useless in your hands!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh yeah? What's ten minus six?
|-
!Franz
|Ten minu- what- hang on...
|-
!Mabel
|Four! ''(Hits Franz into the bonus hole. It glows and shoots up a column of lava, which the golf cart rides on. They skid through the gates and stop in the parking lot, where the cart falls apart. Pencils and an ax poke through the gate.)''
|-
!Franz
|Stay out, you dumb hugelings! ''(Golf balls are tossed over the wall.)''
|-
!Pacifica
|What did you say, you little trolls? I will sue you! I will sue you and I will own you! ''(to the twins:)'' You two! I don't know what you did or what's going on, but if you think just because you saved my life I—
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hands her a sticker that says "I a-paw-logize")'' I'm sorry, Pacifica. We shouldn't have cheated. You totally would have beat me, fair and square.
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Frowns and sticks on the sticker)'' You're just lucky this sticker looks fantastic on me.
|-
!
|''Stan and Soos pull up. Dipper and Mabel get in. Looking at Pacifica standing alone in the parking lot, Dipper shakes his head.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey! Your parents aren't here. Want a ride home?
|-
!Pacifica
|Ugh, please. As if I'd ride in your—
|-
!
|''Lightning flashes and thunder is heard. Cut to inside the car. Pacifica is squished between Dipper and Mabel in the backseat. Stan and Soos are singing the "[[Singing the Driving Song|driving song]]". Pacifica's glove rests on a sticky smudge.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, I found two tacos! ''(Eats one)''
|-
!Pacifica
|You're allowed to eat in the car?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah! The car is where secret surprise snacks happen! Want one?
|-
!Pacifica
|Oh, I'm not supposed to take handouts.
|-
!Mabel
|Handouts? It's called sharing! You do know what sharing is, right?
|-
!Pacifica
|Sha-shaawing?
|-
!Mabel
|Just take it.
|-
!
|''They pull up to [[Northwest Manor|Pacifica's house]]. She gets out.''
|-
!Pacifica
|Thanks for the ride, or whatever. Oh, and Mabel? Um, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I had fun. And tell your servant I like his W-neck!
|-
!Soos
|Yes! ''(The flap falls down.)''
|-
!Dipper
|So are you guys, like, cool now?
|-
!Mabel
|I think we made some progress. The important thing to remember is that at the end of the day, she's just an ordinary kid like us. ''(The gates swing open to reveal the Northwest mansion, complete with fountains and peacocks. Fireworks go off.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Should have charged her for that taco.
|-
!Mabel
|Agreed!
|-
!Soos
|Hey, got any more of those surprise tacos? ''(They all laugh. Franz is hiding on the rear license plate)''
|-
!Franz
|Laugh now, hugelings, but Franz will have his day. Franz will— ''(Falls off and lands upside-down on the side of the road)'' Ah, help! Sand trap, ow, ow!
|-
!
|''Cut to credits.''
|-
!Lilliputtians
|''(Singing:)'' "[[We Control the Balls|We control the balls]]! We control the balls! From Birmingham to Montreal, we control the balls!"
|-
!Miner Lilliputtian
|Hey guys, I figured it out! We control the balls!
|-
!Pirate Lilliputtian
|Now he gets it!
|-
!Miner Lilliputtian
|Oh, you guys!
|-
!Lilliputtians
|''(Laugh, then form a kick-line, singing:)'' "Our lives are filled with nonstop fun! Well there's nothing like a hole in one! ''(Strike a final pose)''
|-
!Sergei
|''(Claps.)'' Can I go now?
|-
!Miner Lilliputtian
|NEVER!

|-
![[Dipper Pines]]
|Alright, Mabel, today is the big day.
|-
![[Mabel Pines]]
|Big day!
|-
!Dipper
|[[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] finally fixed up the [[laptop]]. If this thing works, we could learn the identity of [[Ford Pines|The Author]] and unravel the greatest mysteries of [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]. You ready?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, I'm ready, baby. ''(flips through pages of a [[Ready Baby?|pop-up book]] with a drawing of an infant)'' Ma-ma.
|-
!Dipper
| This is it. This is it. ''(powers on the laptop, which reads "Welcome")'' Aha! It worked.
|-
!Dipper & Mabel
| Blip, blap, bloobity bloop, twins. ''(high-five, bump fists, and stick out tongues)''
|-
!
|''Alarm sounds. The laptop reads "//UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS FORBIDDEN//", and then it reads "Enter Password".''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh! Of course, a password.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't you worry, bro bro. With your brains and my laser focus, there is literally nothing that can distract us from... Did you hear that?
|-
![[Gabe Bensen]]
|''(singing):'' All my life I've been dreamin' of a love that's right for me. And now I finally know her name and it's...
''(talking to the kids:)'' sing it with me kids.

''(singing with kids:)'' [[Literacy]]!

''(Bee puppet:)'' I finally understand what all the buzz is about. Reading!

''(Book puppet:)'' Give me some of that honey! ''(They "kiss". Gabe laughs.)''
|-
!Mabel
| ''(flapping pages of a pop-up of a heart)'' Ba bump. Ba bump.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, boy.
|-
!
|''[[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|Theme song]]''
|-
!Gabe
|Haha. Thank you, thank you.
|-
!Mabel
|Just when I was getting over [[Mermando]], of course, you show up at my doorstep.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walking to bookshelf)'' Oh, yeah, I forgot about Mermando. Did not care for Mermando. ''(grabs the library book off of the shelf and flips though it)'' Okay, this cryptology book says that there's 7.2 million 8-letter words. I'll type, you read. Okay, Mabel? Mabel?
|-
!
|''Mabel's empty chair spins.''
|-
!Gabe
|''(Singing:)'' That's why we don't stick our hands in ''(with kids:)'' [[Other People's Mouths|other people's mouths]]! ''(Talking:)'' Hey, I'm Gabe Benson, ya'll. Good night! ''(Parents walk their kids out) ''
''(Gabe to puppets:)'' Hey, good job today, you guys.

''(Book to Bee:)'' You were late on your cue!

''(Bee:)'' WHAT?

''(Normal:)'' Hey hey, be good to each other. We're all stars.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Rolls in on book cart)'' Hey! Guess who's Mabel! I am. Care to learn more? I bet you do. You like to learn- WAA ''(falls off cart and walks up to him)'' And I'm up!
|-
!Gabe
|Oh, hey, I'm Gabe. Master of puppets. Nice to meet you.
|-
!Mabel
|You're amazing with those puppets.
|-
!Gabe
|Really? ''(sadly:) ''A lot of people think puppets are dumb, or, just for kids or something.
|-
!Mabel
|Are you kidding me? I'm puppet-CRAZY! People call me Puppet-Crazy-Mabel!
|-
!Gabe
|Really? People used to call me Puppet-Crazy-Gabe! So when's your next puppet show?
|-
!Mabel
|My huh?
|-
!Gabe
|I mean, you can't truly love puppets if you're not throwing puppet shows, right?
|-
!Mabel
|Ha, yeah, I mean I'm TOTALLY working on a puppet show.
|-
!Gabe
|Oh, what are the details?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Stalling, nervously:) ''There are soooo many details...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Types in "PASSWORD" on the computer. It beeps.)'' Huh... ''(Mabel sits next to him) ''So, how'd it go?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, how hard do you think it'd be to write and compose a sock puppet rock opera with lights, original music and live pyrotechnics by Friday?
|-
!Dipper
|''(The computer beeps)'' What? ''(grabs Mabel)'' Mabel, are you serious?
|-
!Mabel
|I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED! I got lost in his eyes and his ponytails and I'm gonna be so embarrassed on Friday if I don't have ANYTHING.
|-
!Dipper
|What about cracking this password? You know, mystery twins? ''(bumps fists)''
|-
!Mabel
|If you help me with this for JUST a couple of days I promise I'll help with the password! Please, pretty please! ''(whispering:)'' It's for love, Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|All right, okay-
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hugging him)'' YES! THANK YOU!! THIS GUY! HE'S NUMBER ONE!!!
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, okay, okay, shhhh...''(Dipper and Mabel are leaving the library) ''I can't wait to get to the bottom of this laptop. We're close to something big here; I can feel it...
|-
!
|''Bill's shadow follows them while walking out of the library. Montage of Dipper and Mabel preparing for the opera and Dipper trying to figure out the password. Cuts to everyone (Mabel, Dipper, Soos, Wendy, and [[Waddles]]) in the living room, working on the puppets.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright. This is gonna be called ''[[Glove Story: A Sock Opera]]''. Just to warn you, people's eyes will get wet. Cause they'll be crying. From laughter! From how ''tragic'' it is.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Trying to rip sock puppets that are glued to his face)'' Yeah, um. That's sounds great. ''(Coughs up pom-poms)''
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|Come on, Dipper, you gotta roll with Mabel's craziness. It's what makes life worth living.
|-
!Mabel
|''(singing:)'' [[You're the Boy I Love|Puppet boy, Puppet boy, you're the boy I-]]
|-
!Everyone
|Loooooovvvvveeee! ''(Waddles squeals along)''
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|''(starts to walk in)'' Not even gonna ask.
|-
!
|''Cut to the evening with Mabel putting puppets around her bed.''
|-
!Mabel
|Goodnight, my babies. ''(takes a Gabe puppet and makes it kiss the Mabel puppet)'' Mwop mwop mwop mwop. Mwah! Soon, Gabe Benson-
|-
!
|''Computer beeps.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, wrong password, WRONG, ''WRONG! UGH! (Collapses)''
|-
!Mabel
|Don't stay up all night, Dipper. Last time you got this sleep-deprived you tried to eat your own shirt.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sucking on shirt, then spits it out)'' Pleh. Just a few more tries. ''(Cut to him on the roof, typing and making the computer beep)'' Ugh, I can't take that sound anymore. ''(Pounding on computer)'' I. Hate. You. Sound. ''(Yawns)'' There has to be some shortcut or clue. Who would know about secret codes?
|-
!
|''Wind blows. An eye creeps around the moon, and bricks form around it to reveal [[Bill Cipher|Bill.]] Color vanishes from the world''.
|-
!Bill Cipher
|I THINK I KNOW A GUY.
|-
!
|''Commercial break''
|-
!Bill Cipher
|Well, well, well. You're awfully persistent, Pine Tree. Hats off to you! ''(takes his hat off, tilting the world sideways)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(falling off roof)'' AA! AAA! AAA! AAAAAAA! ''(Falls back on)'' You again!
|-
!Bill
|Did you miss me? ''Ad''mit it, you missed me.
|-
!Dipper
|Hardly. You worked with [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]]! You tried to destroy my uncle's mind!
|-
!Bill
|It was just a job, kid! No hard feelings! I've been keeping an ''(becomes bigger and voice becomes lower:)'' EYE ON YOU ''(normal size and voice:)'' since then, and I must say I'm impressed!
|-
!Dipper
|Really?
|-
!Bill
|You deserve a prize! Here, have a head that's always screaming! ''(claps and a screaming head appears)
|-
!Screaming head
|Aah! Aah! Aah!...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shocked)'' Ah!
|-
!Bill
|''(Snaps and the head disappears layer by layer)'' Hahaha... The point is, I like you. How's about you let me give you a hint, huh? I only ask for a small - ''(Voice gets low and hand and eye light on fire:)'' FAVOR ''(Normal:)'' - in return.
|-
!Dipper
|I'd never do a favor for you! Don't forget who defeated you [[Dreamscaperers|last time]]!
|-
!Bill
|''(Rising out of the roof behind him)'' Right, you "defeated me". Well if you ever change your mind ''(Pretends to grab Dipper's brain)'' I'll be here for you, ready to make a deeaaall. ''(three slots appear spinning on his chest. They stop at a pine tree symbol)'' Hey, wanna hear my impression of you in about three seconds? AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Wakes up)'' AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan in kitchen.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Waving the Stan puppet in Stan's face:)'' Hey, I'm puppet Staaaannn!
|-
!Stan
|Still ignoring this.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks in and yawns)'' Hey Mabel. ''(Yawns)''
|-
!Stan
|Woah, bag check for Dipper's eyes. Ha ha! Nobody?
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, I told you to get some sleep last night! Here, wake up with some Mabel Juice. ''(Holds blender full of red liquid with various objects floating around)'' It has plastic dinosaurs in it!
|-
!Stan
|It's like if coffee and nightmares had a baby!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pushing Mabel into living room)'' Mabel, listen, last night I had a dream with Bill in it.
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, hold up, the triangle guy? ''(holding fingers around her eye to make a triangle)''
|-
!Dipper
|He said he'd give me the code to the laptop if I gave him something. Like I'd actually trust Bill, right?
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry, bro. Today's the day that the mystery twins are back in action. I'll help you crack that code. I've just got to hand off my puppet stuff to my production crew.
|-
!Dipper
|Production crew?
|-
!
|''Cut to Candy and Grenda outside the [[Mystery Shack]] covered in socks.''
|-
![[Candy Chiu]]
|We read the script. Very emotional.
|-
![[Grenda]]
|I cried like eight times.
|-
!Gabe
|Hey ladies. ''(skates up to them)''
|-
!Mabel
|GABE!
|-
!Gabe
|I was just bladin' by. Helps me dry out my ponytail after a shower. ''(Takes off helmet and shakes hair) ''Ah, ah.

|Hubbity-hubbuty.

!Candy
|(''whispering'') ???? ?? ???? ?????! (''Revised Romanization: "Maeibeur'i hante Gaeibeu'eul humchyeohagetda." Subtitled: "I must steal him away from Mabel.")''

!Mabel
|It's so great to see you! I was just working on the world's greatest puppet show. IT HAS PUPPETS!

!Gabe
|Your passion is so refreshing, Mabel. Unlike the girl from last night's puppet show. Single-stich on one puppet, and ''cross-stitch'' on the other? I was like, "Uh-uh!"
|-
!Mabel
|Cross-huh?
|-
!Gabe
|Naturally I deleted her off my cell phone contacts list.
|-
!Mabel
|NATURALLY! Hahahaha!
|-
!Gabe
|I know you won't let me down. Based on what you said the other day, you must be a puppet expert.
|-
!Grenda
|You know, Gabe, you look pretty sweaty. You should really take your shirt off. Right? Aren't we all thinking that?
|-
!Gabe
|Later, ladies. ''(Skates off)''
|-
!Mabel
|GWAAA!! We gotta up our game, girls! Did you hear that thing he said about the stitches?!
|-
!Grenda
|Don't worry, Mabel, your crew can handle it! ''(Holds up puppet of herself, but then rips it)'' Oops.
|-
!Candy
|How many eyes does a face have again? ''(Holds up sock covered in googly eyes)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Trying to keep a mountain of stuff on the car)'' I got it, I got it, ''(Falls)'' Ah! I'm not okay!
|-
!Mabel
|AAA! Okay, I'm back on fabrication. ''(Running)'' Get me my lint roller!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Grabs her)'' Whoa, whoa! Hey, you just said you were going to help me!
|-
!Mabel
|DIPPER! This sock crisis just bumped up to code argyle! The laptop can wait!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, do you seriously think that your random crush of the week is more important than uncovering the mysteries of this town? You're obsessed!
|-
!Mabel
|I'm obsessed? Look at you! You look like a vampire! And not the hot kind!
|-
!Dipper
|''(rubs eyes)'' But you said you were going to help me today!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sock:)'' Oh, I can help you. With tickles! ''(Tickles him)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha! Ha! Ha! ''(punches her arm and Candy and Grenda laugh) ''Okay, fine! You know what? I'll do it on my own! ''(in attic, typing)'' Passwords. Passwords. Mabel. Is. Useless. ''(Yawns)'' Oh, man...
|-
!Computer
|Too many failed entries. Initiate data erase in five minutes.
|-
!Dipper
|No! Noonono! I'm gonna lose everything?! I only have one more try?!
|-
!
|''Everything turns black and white and Bill appears.''
|-
!Bill
|Well, well, well. Someone's looking desperate.
|-
!Dipper
|I thought I told you to leave me alone.
|-
!Bill
|I can help you, kid. (''hand lights on fire)'' You just need to hear out my demands.
|-
!Dipper
|''(looking at computer, which is at 4 minutes now)'' Uh, what crazy thing do you want anyway? To eat my soul? To rip out my teeth? Are you gonna replace my eyes with baby heads or something?
|-
!Bill
|Yeesh, kid, relax. All I want is a puppet!
|-
!Dipper
|A puppet? What are you playing at?
|-
!Bill
|Everyone loves puppets. And it looks to me that you've got a surplus.
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know, man. Mabel worked really hard on these.
|-
!Bill
|Seems to me one little puppet is a small price to pay to learn all the secrets of the universe. (''his voice echoes on the last word'') Besides, what's your sister done for you, lately? How many times have you sacrificed for her, huh? And when has she ever returned the favor? ''(flashes back to scenes from "[[Tourist Trapped]]," "[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]," and "[[The Deep End]]").''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks at Mabel playing outside with her friends, and the computer, which now has 30 seconds on the clock)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Eye becomes a clock)'' Tick tock, kid. ''(Reaches for him and hand lights on fire)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, just one puppet? Fine! ''(shakes hand)'' So what puppet are you gonna pick, anyway?
|-
!Bill
|Hmm, let's see. Eenie meenie mynie... ''(voice gets low and echoes:)'' YOU. ''(Tears Dipper from his body)''
|-
!Dipper
|Huh? ''(floating transparently. Puts his hand through his stomach'') This can't be happening! What did you do to my body?!
|-
!Bill
|''(In Dipper's body, gets up)'' Sorry, kid but you're MY puppet, now! AAHAHAHA! ''(throws computer to floor and steps on it)'' AHAHAHA!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh my gosh, this can't be happening. This can't be happening!
|-
!Bill
|''(stumbles around, cackling. He stops in front of a mirror while a horrified Dipper watches.)'' Man, it has been so long since I've inhabited a body. ''(slaps himself in the face)'' Woo! ''(slaps the other cheek)'' Woo! Haha! Pain is hilarious!! And two eyes? This thing's deluxe! ''(Examines his eyes and pulls down his lip to look inside his mouth.)''
|-
!Dipper
|I don't understand! Why are you doing this?! I thought we had a deal!
|-
!Bill
|Look kid, you've been getting way too close to figuring out some major answers. I've got big plans comin' and I don't need you gettin' in my way. Destroying that laptop was a cinch. Now I just need to destroy your [[Journal 3|journal]]. Race ya to the bottom of the stairs! ''(Tips backward and tumbles down the stairs.)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(gasps. He zooms down through the floor and lands in the living room. He steadies himself and flies through the wall into the hall.)'' Hey!
|-
!Bill
|''(In the kitchen, taking a can of Pitt cola from the fridge.)'' Human soda! I'm gonna drink it like a person! ''(He pours it into his mouth and over his face, laughing.)'' Where do you keep that journal anyway? ''(Opens a drawer and reaches in. He slams the drawer on his arm repeatedly.)'' It's gotta be around here somewhere. ''(Continues slamming drawer, occasionally wincing)'' Boy, these arms are durable.
|-
!Dipper
|I've hidden it! ''(Bill strokes his chin thoughtfully, forks stuck in his arm.)'' Somewhere you'll never find it in a million years!
|-
!Mabel
|Hey Dipper! ''(From the doorway)'' I borrowed your journal to use as a prop in the show I hope you don't mind I'm gonna go before you process this sentence okay BYEE!! ''(runs off)''
|-
!Bill
|''(He looks at Dipper, then grins)'' Sure, sounds great, sister! I'll see you at the show!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait! No, Mabel, don't listen to him! That's not me! ''(He flies after Mabel. Mabel gets in Grunkle Stan's car.)'' You've gotta hear me! ''(He flies in front of the car.)'' No, no! Wait! Stop! ''(The car drives through him.)''
|-
!Bill
|Heh! welcome to the mindscape, kid! Without a vessel to possess, you're basically a ghost!
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|Oh, hey Dipper! There you are!
|-
!Wendy
|What up, dude?
|-
!Dipper
|Soos! Wendy! Help me! ''(He waves his arms and flies through Soos.)''
|-
!Soos
|''(to Bill:)'' We're heading to the theater.
|-
!Wendy
|Need a ride, Dipper?
|-
!Bill
|Oho, anything for you, Red! ''(He gets in the car)''
|-
!Dipper
|I'm gonna stop you, Bill! I'm gonna find that journal before you do and I'm gonna stop you!!
|-
!Bill
|But how can you stop me, ''(slowly turns to Dipper)'' if you don't exist? ''(He laughs maniacally as the window rolls up, showing Dipper's horrified expression. The car drives off, and Dipper is left staring after it.)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the outside of the [[Theatre Time Theater]]. Dipper flies out of a nearby building.''
|-
!Dipper
|Bill? Bill! I gotta get my body back before he does something crazy with it. ''(He flies into the theater.)''
|-
!Bill
|Aw, nothing like the theater, huh toots? ''(He is sitting with an arm around Wendy and Soos.)'' Hey Soos, wanna hear the exact time and date of your death?
|-
!Soos
|Heheh, okay!
|-
!Mabel
|Hey guys! You all made it!
|-
! Stan
|Are you kidding me? I would never miss... whatever this is.
|-
!Bill
|By the by, Mabel, where'd you put my journal again?
|-
!Mabel
|I used it as a prop for the big wedding scene! I still need a reverend, though.
|-
!Bill
|Hey, what if I play the reverend? I mean, someone's gotta hold that journal, right?
|-
!Mabel
|Right! Let's go! ''(runs off with Bill)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, no! Wait! Mabel! ''(He flies after and follows them backstage.)''
|-
!
|''Mabel peeks through the curtain. Gabe is sitting down with his puppets. The lights flicker.''
|-
!Grenda
|The show is about to begin! Please turn off your cell phones! Unless you're texting me, cuties!
|-
!
|''The house lights dim, and, to applause, the curtain opens. The set is a glittery and colorful Mystery Shack. A light illuminates Candy, standing at a keyboard, dressed as David Bowie.''
|-
!Candy
|Gather round, and let us sing, about a girl who had almost everything.
|-
!
|''She is rolled off the stage. A Dipper puppet pops out of a window and sings.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(As Puppet Dipper:)'' Look, it's Mabel! ''(Puppet Mabel pops up.)''
(A''s Puppet Mabel:)'' Hi there!

''(As Puppet Soos:)'' Did you say stable?

''(As Puppet Stan:)'' No, he said Mabel!

''(As Puppet Mabel:)'' Okay, hit it, boys!! ''(The puppets form a line and sing.)''

''(Singing as puppets:)'' [[Who's That Girl|Who's that girl]] with the pig and the braces? She puts smiles on everyone's faces! ''(Gabe smiles and nods along)'' When she's around, you're never bored!

''(As Puppet mayor:)'' I am a mayor, and here's an award!

''(Singing as Puppet Mabel:)'' Thank you, mayor, it's true I'm great. But the perfect girl needs the perfect maaaate... ''(Gabe puppet is revealed.)''

(''As Puppet Gabe:)'' Hey, what's up, I'm Gabe.

''(As Puppet Mabel:)'' Bwaaaa? ''(Heart glasses are layered over eyes)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Grenda is standing backstage. Bill, dressed in vicarage clothing, walks up behind her)'' So, hey, Grendo! Where's that book prop I'm using for the wedding scene?
|-
!Grenda
|It's up in the wedding cake. But that doesn't come down until Act 3. So hold your horses!
|-
!Bill
|''(backing away)'' Oh, I'll hold my horses. I'll hold them... you monster.
|-
!Dipper
|''(flies up to Grenda)'' Hey! Listen! Have you seen Mabel? ''(Grenda doesn't see him.)'' What did Bill say? I can't be heard without a vessel? Where would I find a- ''(notices a pile of puppets and grins)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(As Puppet Mabel:)'' Finally, we're together.
''(As Puppet Gabe:)'' I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have to go fight. In the war! ''(A helmet lands on his head. He yells and runs off into a ravaged, flaming background. With a roar, a gigantic many-tentacled monster appears. Lasers flash, fog rolls in, and gunshots are heard.)''

''(As Puppet Mabel:)'' I'll wait for you, Gabe! I'll wait for you!! ''(Happy music plays and the curtain closes. The audience cheers.)''
|-
!Grenda
|Our intermission has begun! Mill about! ''(The audience does.)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(In her dressing room)'' Whew, okay, you can do this, Mabel. Only 36 more musical numbers. ''(She drinks from the water fountain. The Dipper puppet slowly rises, floating beside Mabel.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Pst, Mabel!'' (She notices the Dipper puppet talking and does a spit take.)'''<nowiki/>'''''
|-
!Mabel
|Aah! It's come to life! The puppetbooks didn't warn me about this! ''(She throws a fork at it.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, it's me, Dipper! You need to help me!
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, what, Dipper?! But you're... so much more of a sock than usual!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, you have to listen. Bill tricked me! He stole my body and now he's after the journal! You have to find the journal before Bill destroys it. It's the only hope to get me back in my body!
|-
!Mabel
|But my cue's coming up any minute! ''(There is a knock on the door and Gabe enters with flowers.)''
|-
!Gabe
|Hey, Mabel, do you have a moment?
|-
!Mabel
|GABE! ''(She grabs the puppet floating beside her and tucks it behind her back, laughing nervously. Dipper struggles to free his hand.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ow! Mabel!
|-
!Gabe
|Mabel, it's clear to me now that you really love puppets. I mean, you went whole hog. And if you stick the ending, well, maybe later you could join me for a biscotti?
|-
!Mabel
|You drive a biscotti? ''(The lights flick on and off)''
|-
!Gabe
|I'll be waiting. ''(He leaves.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Did you hear that? He loves it! This play has to be flawless. Can't we wait until after the show?
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel! You want me to be a sock puppet forever?! ''(The puppet's arms flail)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(laughs)'' I'm sorry, it- it looks funny when you're mad.
|-
!Dipper
|''(grunting)''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, okay, okay, just take over for me till I get back with the book. Little puppet face!
|-
!
|''Cut to the stage. Dipper is providing the voices for the puppets.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(As Puppet Mabel:)'' Gabe! You're back from the war!
''(As Puppet Gabe:)'' Yes I am! Wanna kiss and sing at the same time?

''(As Puppet Mabel:)'' Okay! ''(He makes kissing sound effects as the puppets kiss.)''

(''To himself:)'' Seriously?
|-
!
|''The audience applauds. Mabel climbs the catwalk and runs over to where the giant cake is hanging. The journal sits inside. Mabel climbs over the edge and reaches for the journal.''
|-
!Mabel
|Come on, come on! ''(Falls into the cake and it plummets down. Just before it hits the stage, it is pulled back up.)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(As Mabel:)'' I hope this kiss never ends!
|-
!Mabel
|''(sighs)'' Come on, come on now, there must be a way to get Dipper's body back!
|-
!Bill
|Oho, but why would you want to do that? ''(Mabel looks up to see Bill pulling the cake up, with lights shining behind his grinning face.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Bill Dipper! Bipper.
|-
!Bill
|Shh! You wouldn't want to ruin the show... Whoops! ''(He briefly releases the cake, sending Mabel plummeting.)'' It's slipping! How's about you hand that book over?
|-
!Mabel
|No way! This is Dipper's! I'd never give it away!
|-
!Bill
|Hmm, you didn't seem to have a problem taking it for your own play, ditching him when he needed you. So come to your senses. Give me the book or your play is ruined. ''(Mabel sighs and begins to hand over the journal.)'' There it is. I mean, who would sacrifice everything they've worked for just for their dumb sibling?
|-
!Mabel
|''Dipper'' would.
|-
!Bill
|Huh? ''(Mabel pulls him into the cake and they fall to the stage.)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(As Puppet Stan:)'' I'm giving you away. You are a woman now. Waddles, the rings! ''(Waddles squeals)'' Wait, what? ''(Dipper looks up to see the falling cake.) '' Oh no. ''(The cakes crashes to the floor. Mabel and Bill tumble out, grappling over the journal. Lasers and fog go off.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Get out of my brother's body, you evil triangle!
|-
!Stan
|''(gets out camera)'' Whoa! Children fighting! I can sell this.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hits Bill in the face with the journal and runs away.)''
|-
!Bill
|You can't stop me! I'm a being of pure energy with no weakness! ''(Lunges at Mabel.)''
|-
!Mabel
|True, but you're in Dipper's body. And I know all his weaknesses!
|-
!Bill
|Whaddya mean his- ''(Mabel tickles him)''
|-
!Mabel
|Tickle, tickle!
|-
!Bill
|''(Laughs and falls on the floor.)'' Aah! Body spasms! What are these?
|-
!Mabel
|A little note about the human body- You haven't slept for 24 hours! ''(She runs around the stage, Bill chasing her)'' Also, I got a full night's sleep and I'm on four mega-shots of Mabel Juice!
|-
!Bill
|''(His face drooping)'' Ah! What is this feeling? ''(Wheezing)'' My body is burning! I can't move these stupid noodle legs! Curse you, useless flesh sticks! Body...shutting down... must...scratch... mosquito bites...
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel watch as Bill stumbles around, then he collapses. Bill shoots out of Dipper's body and the world turns black and white.''
|-
!Bill
|Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.. hey! ''(Dipper flies back into his body and opens his eyes.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! Yes! I'm in my own body! And it's... just as underwhelming as I remember. ''(He stands and grips his back in pain.)'' Ooh, everything hurts.
|-
!Bill
|''(cackling. The twins look over to see the Dipper puppet talking.)'' This isn't the last you'll hear of me! Big things are coming! You can't stop me!
|-
!Mabel
|I'm sorry, Gabe.
|-
!
|''She pushes the "Big Finish" button. Bill is revealed to be on a pile of pyrotechnics, which explodes, sending fireworks shooting into the audience and blowing up the box of puppets. In slow motion, the Grunkle Stan puppet arcs through the air, aflame, as Gabe, amid falling puppets, looks on in shock. "[[Ave Maria]]" plays mournfully.''
|-
!
|''The rest of the fireworks go off in a cacophonous boom, and Dipper gleefully stomps on the Dipper puppet. As the smoke clears from the smoldering set, the twins turn to the audience. Some scaffolding crashes to the floor behind them.''
|-
!Mabel
|Don't worry. I've seen enough movies to know this is the part where the audience thinks it was all part of the show and loves it. Cue applause!
|-
!
|''The audience stares at them and starts to boo. They get up and leave the theater, grumbling about how they almost died. Gabe stands, frowning.''
|-
!Mabel
|Gabe! Stick around for the wrap party? We've got mini-quiches!
|-
!Gabe
|Don't speak to me, Mabel. You've made a mockery of my art form. Let's go, my loves. ''(He walks away, kissing the puppets.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Did he just make out with his puppets?
|-
!Mabel
|I might've dodged a bullet there.
|-
!Candy

(''running after him'') ???? ??! ?? ? ??? ? ???! (''Revised Romanization: "Gaeibeu'i jamkkan! Kaendi na ajikdo neol saranghae!" Subtitled: "Wait, Gabe! Candy still loves you!"'')
|-
!Dipper
|Oof. Mabel, I'm sorry about all this. It's my fault your puppets got ruined.
|-
!Mabel
|Well, one of them survived. ''(Pulls out the Mabel puppet.)'' And she has something to say to you. ''(as puppet)'' I'm sorry, Dipper. I spent all week obsessing over a dumb guy. But the dumb guy I should have cared about was you! Bap! ''(Nudges Dipper's face.)'' Mystery twins?
|-
!Dipper
|Mystery twins. ''(They fist bump. Dipper gasps in pain.)'' Ow! What'd Bill do to my hand? Ahh!
|-
!Mabel
|Nothing a little sleep can't fix. ''(They walk offstage.)'' Come on, bro bro, let's go home.
|-
!Dipper
|Seriously, I need to go to the hospital.
|-
!
|''End credits. Real-life Dipper and Mabel puppets.''
|-
!Mabel Puppet
|Hey Dipper, what did one sock puppet say to the other sock puppet?
|-
!Dipper Puppet
|I don't know Mabel, what?
|-
!Mabel Puppet
|You look like you could use a HAND! ''(She laughs. Dipper Puppet faces away annoyed. The curtain closes. Puppet Stan and [[Old Man McGucket]] are sitting in a theater booth)''
|-
!McGucket Puppet
|That joke was really something!
|-
!Stan Puppet
|Yeah, something terrible! ''(Laugh)''
|-
!
|''Mabel wakes up with a scream. She turns the Mabel puppet away from her bed and goes back to sleep.''

!Mabel
|Yeah! I wore my motivational sweater and everything thing! ''(Sweater reads "U can do it Soos". Points to the second o in Soos, which is misplaced)'' I messed up that part.

!.GIFfany
|Oh, Soos. ''(Another .GIFfany appears)'' I am not an ordinary game. ''(Another .GIFfany)'' I am... ''(Points to toy dog on a shelf, making it bark)'' special.

|-
!Soos
|Wha-what did you do to them?
|-
!.GIFfany
|''(Many .GIFfanys appear)'' That's not important. What's important is that you won't have to talk to real girls ever again. You and me can be together. ''(All screens make up one, huge .GIFfany. The large .GIFfany's voice sounds echoic.)'' Forever!
|-
!Soos
|Wow, that's awesome! Sort of a red flag, but mostly awesome! So, what do you want to do now?

!Mabel
|You don't need it anymore; you can toss it out!

!Soos
|Toss it? But, I like .GIFfany. She's good to me. She's ''predictable''.

|Well, have you ever had to choose between two things you like, but you don't know which one is right for you? I mean, I'm just thinkin' long term... Maybe I should be someone a little less ''(Mimicking a game character) ''"beep boop." Heh, you know?
|-
!.GIFfany
|I don't think you know what you're saying, Soos. No one loves you more than me. The girls out there will just make fun of you!

|-
!Wendy
|Alright, Stan. This is weird even for you. Do you need to talk?
|-
!Stan
|Nothing you can say will change my mind, Wendy. Sometimes, a man has to steal an animatronic badger, to stay in this crazy game called life. ''(Unlocks window)''
|-
!Wendy
|Or... you could just not care.
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens window)'' It's about the principle. No one tells Stan Pines he's out of the game. No one tells- whoa! ''(Falls out window)''

|Do you really think that Melody will take you back after this awful date? ''(Screen shows Melody giving Soos back his flowers to her and slams the door. It starts to rain.

''(Gestures to lump of random body parts that are groaning)'' Nope? Not a fan? Too many orifices? Alright, I can tell what you're looking for is this ''(Pulls hand out of a chest)'' disembodied hand! Why is it so expensive? Well, that's quite a tale. And it's called HANDS OFF! No seriously, hands off ''(Takes a glowing reptilian eye from person)'' that's not for sale. Alright, HANDS OFF!!

|-
!Dipper
|I told you, Grunkle Stan. You gotta give that watch back and apologize.

!Dipper, Mabel, and Stan
|What?

|Let's go, kids. ''(Starts to leave)''
|-
!Hand Witch
|NO, WAIT DON'T GO! Ehh- you're right, you're right. I-I-I was just making all of that stuff up. I-I was just trying to get something going, you know? It's so hard to meet people these days... ''(Snaps fingers and hands let kids go and braid Mabel's hair)''
|-
!Dipper
|So this was all just a ploy to get a date?
|-
!Hand Witch
|I'M DESPERATE, OKAY? But every time I bring someone back here without keeping their hands hostage, they just run away.
|-
!Stan
|Well, yeah, look at this horror show! It's creepy even for a cave.
|-
!Mabel
|You just need to redecorate! For example: ''(Grabs a bunch of hands)'' A Handalabra!

!Hand Witch
|OOOH! THE HAND WITCH LIKES.
|-
!Mabel
|Then watch me work. ''(Throws hands)'' HOME MAKEOVER!

|-
!Hand Witch
|Oh, right! ''(Hands come out of her hair and crawl around Stan before reattaching)''
|-
!Stan
|Shakey! Scratchy! I've missed you, old rascals. You're all right, sister.

|Will you be my boyfriend now?

|''The hand crawls around before leaving the room.''
|-
!Stan
|You're a savvy customer. But perhaps you'd be interested in buying... ''(Searching his pockets, then sees [[Waddles]] and grabs him)'' This magic pig! Sure, he doesn't look magic, but there's a very interesting story I'm about to make up about him. And it's called: "ABACONINGS!"

|Mabel, could you knock it off? I'm trying to solve this intelligence puzzle but it seems impossible. ''(It beeps)''
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe you're just not smart enough.

|...We'll see about that. ''(Cut to him reading [[Journal 3]]:) ''"Buried near the falls is the legendary [[Percepshrooms|Percepshroom]]. To increase brainpower, grind it up and apply to forehead overnight" ''(Does as the instructions state; to What-the-heck-ahedron:)'' Tomorrow, I own you!

|What?!

|Waddles! What happened to you? Have you been possessed by the spirit of a nerd!?
|-
!Waddles
|''(Drives closer)'' I understand that my transformation may be vexing, but I have prepared a presentation- ''(Bumps into computer, knocking it over)'' Forgive me. My pig arms are cute and useless.
|-
!Dipper
|The brain goop! You ate it and built all this, didn't you?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs up to Waddles with a children's animal sounds toy)'' THIS ISN'T RIGHT! THE PIG GOES OINK! THE PIG GOES OINK!!!
|-
!Waddles
|Now the pig goes wherever he can shine the light of knowledge into the darkness of ignorance.

|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, this pig's got a gift. He needs to share it with the world!
|-
!Waddles
|I'm sorry, Mabel. There is more to life than making fart noises, and laughing at those fart noises. I see that now. ''(He and Dipper leave)''
|-
!Mabel
|Right. Yeah. You guys. Just go on without me. ''(Presses fart button)''

!

|-
!Mabel
|''(Coming in)'' What the heck is going on here?
|-
!Waddles
|Mabel, you are just in time to behold our greatest achievement. The "[[Smarticle Accelerator]]".

!Dipper
|Solving that brain puzzle was just the tip of the iceberg, With this, Waddles will be able to solve all the greatest puzzles of the UNIVERSE.

|-
!Dipper
|Soon, your pig is gonna be famous! Meeting with scientists, presidents... I wonder if I could teach him to wear pants.
|-
!Mabel
|The whole world? But when will you have time for us? I'm your best friend.
|-
!Waddles
|''(He makes a mechanical hand pet her)'' I'm still your friend, Mabel, but I'm helping people now.
|-
!Mabel
|But what about helping me? Do you really want to spend your whole life in meetings with dumb smart guys? This brain junk has made you forget who you are. Don't you remember... us?
|-
!Waddles
|''([[Remember Those Times|Flashes back on various memories of hanging out with Mabel]])'' It all makes sense now. What good is helping the world if I can't help my favorite person in the world? It's a good thing I built in a dumb-dumb switch. ''(Pulls a lever from "FWD." to "REV")''
|-
!Dipper
|Waddles, Waddles, don't! WAIT!
|-
!Waddles
|I'm sorry, Dipper. In my last eight seconds of consciousness I want you to know that science is a horizon to search for, not a prize to hold in your hand. Also, I miss getting my tummy tickled. ''(Squeals; jumps into Mabel's arms)''

!Dipper
|Good pig. Uggh.

!
|''An arrow with a suction cup on the end sticks to his fez.''
|-
!Stan
|No shooting in the house, sweetie! But perhaps I can interest you in something else. ''(Walks back over to the chest and pulls out a tape)'' Like these spooooky moooovies. Movies are great! You watch the movie, you scare the girl, the girl snuggles up next to you, next thing you know you gotta raise a kid. Your life falls apart. Forget that last part. This next tale is called "Clay Day"! ''(Clay Day title card appears. Cut to the Pines family and [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] in the living room. Mabel is watching TV)''

|-
!Stan and Soos
|Uhhh...
|-
!Dipper
|Everything about this is bad.
|-
!Stan
|Well, that just put me 90 minutes closer to death. ''(Holds up movie)'' It's time you kids learned to watch the classics from my day.
|-
!Mabel
|Ooo, old people movies. Get ready for references we don't understand, and words we can't repeat.

|Well. Your sister's broken.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, Grunkle Stan, I should have told you before. Mabel has a childhood terror of old-timey stop-motion animation. It's like her number one fear since we were kids.

!Stan
|Heh heh. Come on, those hogey old things? How scared could she be?

!
|''Cut to Mabel hiding in the laundry basket in the attic.''

|The cyclops! His face is made of nightmares!
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens the closet door)'' Kid, it's just a movie, it can't hurt you!
|-
!Mabel
|No talking. They wait for you to talk and then crawl inside your mouth!
|-
!Dipper
|Why did you have to show her that tape?
|-
!Stan
|There's got to be a way to get her over this! ''(Looks at the back of the tape)'' Huh...
|-
!
|''Cut to everyone at the gates of [[Harry Claymore|Harry Claymore's]] [[Claymore Manor|workplace]]. Mabel is still in the laundry basket.''
|-
!Stan
|Alright. If we can just get the director to show her the models are fake, maybe she'll finally calm down.
|-
!Soos Ramirez
|I don't know, dude. According to the Internet, special effects genius Harry Claymore is some kind of recluse.
|-
!Stan
|The man wants his privacy. I can respect that. ''(Swings rope over gate)'' Well, everyone over the fence.
|-
!
|''Everyone is in the yard, heading to the house.''
|-
!Stan
|You see, Mabel, those monsters are just clay models moved around one frame at a time, by an antisocial shut-in.
|-
!Soos
|Those people are called animators.
|-
!Dipper
|Hello? Mr. Claymore?
|-
!Stan
|We wanna get a look at your figurines!
|-
!Soos
|We're not paparazzi! ''(Flashes camera phone several times)''

!Dipper
|Aha! ''(Picks up a mini gorilla figurine)'' See, Mabel? It's all just special effects. You can come out.

!Harry Claymore
|I'm afraid they want you. ''(He is also tied up)''

!Stan
|Harry Claymore! Master of special effects! Circa-1970's-something.

|What? You really believe someone moves these figures one frame at a time? I'm not a masochist! I use black magic to make them animate themselves. It was great at first, but one day...
|-
!
|''Flashback''
|-
!Cyclops
|''(Looks at newspaper, which says that computer animation is better than stop motion)'' No! Where's the heart?
|-
!Harry
|Now that they were out of work, they went mad and enslaved me! And now they will turn you into unholy beasts clay to join in their mischeif!
|-
!Soos
|Huh, Mr. Pines. At least you finally get to work with your favorite director. And by work, I mean suffocate inside a big wad of clay!
|-
!
|''More clay is stuffed on Soos. The three call out for help. Mabel sees the whole thing.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, what do I do? How can I defeat those monstrosities? ''(Picks up a wad of clay with two holes in them. Mabel adds a line so it looks like a smiley face)'' Hey. I changed into something I like. Woah. I think I have an idea! ''(Runs down stairs.)'' Hey, One-Eyeclopses! Yeah, I'm talking to you, dumb-dumb! Come at me! WOOAAAAA!!! ''(Runs at it with her arms in front of her and jumps into its stomach, crawls up it, and emerges from its shoulders)'' Wipe that face off your face! ''(Smears it)'' Oh, I've got big plans for you. ''(Later)'' Hey, skeleton dorks! IT'S CLAYBACK TIME!!
|-
!
|''The Cyclops is remade into Shimmery Twinkleheart.''
|-
!Shimmery Twinkleheart
|''(Walks up and falls down on a bunch of skeletons)''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, you conquered your fear!
|-
!Shimmery Twinkleheart
|That's right. Because she believed in herself-
|-
!Mabel
|JAM, IT, TWINKLEHEART! Just start pounding those skeletons!
|-
!Shimmery Twinkleheart
|Hoo hoo hoo... ''(Attacking skeletons)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs to everyone else)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, you did it! So you're not scared anymore?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Taking the clay off of him)'' Oh, I'm scared twice as much now. But now I know it's rational! ''(Starts taking the clay off of Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you. ''(Punches through clay)''. You were right! Stop-motion is pure evil.
|-
!
|''We see the stop-motion monsters fighting in shadow. Shimmery Twinkleheart punches several skeletons.''
|-
!Soos
|And probably really expensive.
|-
!Harry Claymore
|Incredibly expensive.
|-
!Soos
|This is an impressive fight, though. I'm glad I'm facing towards it.
|-
!
|''A scorpion with the head of medusa attacks Shimmery Twinkleheart and they melt into the mass of clay. Unicorns rain from the ceiling and fall into it.''
|-
!All
|''(Clapping)'' Yaaaaayyyyy!!
|-
!Harry Claymore
|That was the best part!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Mystery Shack. Stan, Dipper, and Mabel are watching "Loiclothiclese in the creature with an unreasonable amount of heads."''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, I think today we learned that you can remold your fears.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm just glad that none of us got turned into clay.
|-
!Soos
|Holy Toledo! ''(He steps out of a wall of clay and looks like Gumby)'' Who wants to see me change into most anything? Do do do do do... ''(Becomes cylinder shaped, then normal shaped)'' I can walk through walls! ''(Runs out of shot and back into shot from opposite side)'' Woah, woa-
|-
!Stan
|''(Throws the TV remote at him, cutting off his head)'' We're safe now kids. We're safe. ''(Cut back to Stan in the Mystery Shack at night)'' I don't get it. You don't want the pig, you don't want my tapes, WHAT ARE YA GONNA BUY?! How about this delicious potion? Here, have a free sample. ''(Gives person the potion)''
|-
!Traveler
|''(Drinks it, then stumbles around and collapses)''
|-
!Stan
|You should have bought my merch when you had the chance, buddy. But that's okay. I'll have something new for sale very soon. ''(Painting the person with glue)'' Heh heh heh heh...
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack at day. The person is in a glass case that says "THE CHEAPSKATE" on the front.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Leading a tour group)'' And here we have our latest attraction: the legendary Cheapskate.
|-
!Girl
|I saw it blinking.
|-
!Stan
|Heh! Just an optical illusion.
|-
!Woman
|''(Takes picture)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Leading group away)'' Come along, everyone. Step right up... AHAHAHA!
|-
!Traveler
|''(Pounds on glass)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Returns)'' That's right, I'm a jerk!
|-
!
|''Epilogue. Mabel is standing in front of the case and Dipper is reading on the Gift Shop counter.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To person:)'' Hey! Wanna play tic-tac-toe? ''(Draws tic-tac-toe board on glass)''
|-
!Traveler
|''(Draws X in the top middle space)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, I wanted to be Xs! Let me be Xs.
|-
!Dipper
|Trust me, just let her be Xs.
|-
!Traveler
|''(Sighs and draws an O in the middle space)''
|-
!Mabel
|Yaaay! ''(Draws X in middle right space)'' Actually, I'm sorry, I changed my mind; I want to be Os.
|-
!Tourist
|''(Draws X in upper left space)''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, you're gooonna hate me right now, but could Xs be a possibility?
|-
!Traveler
|''(Writing on glass:)'' HELP ME
|-
!Mabel
|I don't think you're playing this right.

| ''Open to a shot of [[Greasy's Diner]]. [[Lazy Susan]] is locking up the diner for the night..''
|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(hums while sweeping a broom across the floor)'' Ta dum, locking up. ''(peers at possums scurrying around in the dishes, pokes the possums with her broom)'' Shoo, possums, shoo! ''(She walks near a table)'' Git, [[Old Man McGucket|McGucket]], git! ''(pokes him with a broom, making him run out from underneath the table on all fours, panting, and mumbling incoherently.)'' Ta dum, ta dum... ''(locks the door)'' Good night, diner. Good night, trees. ''(She passes by the [[gnomes]] standing on top of each other, attempting to steal a pie.)'' Good night, tiny men stealing my pie. Wait, WHAT?! ''(Lifts her eyelid)''
|-
![[Jeff]]
|Lift with your knees. No, your ''knees''. If I go one more hour without eating, I'm gonna resort to cannibalism. ''(notices Lazy Susan, and tips his hat.)'' Ma'am.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(Shrieks)'' Little magic men! What does it mean? What do I do? ''(bumps into a payphone and dials 911)'' Yes, hi. I's like to report something. I'm at Greasy's Diner. You won't believe what I've witnessed. ''(Cut to two figures sneaking up behind her, from a patch of nearby bushes)'' It's unbelievable! It's indescribable! It's- AAAAAAAH!! ''(The figures sneak up behind her and kidnap her, dragging her away.)''
|-
![[Blind Ivan]]
|It is unseen. ''(The [[Blind Eye Society|Blind Eye]] symbol is graffited on the wall)''
|-
!Jeff
|Welp, back to pie. ''(The gnomes grab the pie and run off. A gnome accidentally drops a slice.)'' I was this close to eating you, [[Gnomes|Steve]].
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Cut to [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]'s bedroom. Dipper is examining a poster board on his wall entitled "Who is [[Ford Pines|The Author]]?''
|-
!Dipper Pines
|Alright author, who are you? Who are you?... ''(chews on a pen, which accidentally breaks)'' Blech! Not again. ''(tosses it into a bin full of broken pens.)''
|-
!Mabel Pines
|''(runs in with a bottle)'' Hey, bro-bro. Look what I got!
|-
!Dipper
|''(sarcastically)'' Yay, a filthy green bottle!
|-
!Mabel
|It's a bottle message from [[Mermando]], remember? He was part fish, part shirtless guy. ''(gasps)'' What if he wants to get back together?
|-
!Dipper
|I wouldn't get your hopes up, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Too late! Hopes are way way up! ''(squeals excitedly, opens bottle cap and reads letter)'' "Dear Mabel..." So far so good! "It is with a heavy heart..." So far so good! "...that I must inform you, I'm getting married"?!
|-
!Dipper
|And there it is.
|-
!Mabel
|''(reading)'' "In order to prevent an undersea civil war... arranged wedding... [[Queen of the Manatees]]?!" ''(looking at picture)'' And she's so beautiful! ''(sighs)'' This can't be happening!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, Mabel. You'll get over him eventually.
|-
!Mabel
|You don't understand, Dipper. ''(Pulls out her scrapbook.)'' On my first day here, I made this page for summer romances. Look at my luck. ''(Points to picture of [[Gnomes|Norman]])'' Turned out to be gnomes, ''(Points to picture of [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]])'' child psycho, ''(Points to a picture of [[Gabe Bensen]])'' made out with his own hands. And now... ''(writes "FAILED" at the top of the page)'' I wish I could just forget about them forever.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, if it's any consolation, my summer mission isn't a huge success either. I'm still trying to find the author of [[Journal 3|this journal]], but with this laptop smashed, I've lost any lead in finding him.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looks at the [[laptop]])'' Wait a minute. Dipper, look!
|-
!Dipper
|Through your bottle?
|-
!Mabel
|Just do it.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Peers through the bottle, and notices a logo entitled "McGucket Labs" magnified on the back of the laptop)'' "McGucket Labs." Wait, Old Man McGucket?
|-
!Mabel
|You don't think?...
|-
!Dipper
|Couldn't be... Doesn't make any sense, unless... ''(He starts connecting pictures and tying strings to the author)'' This matches with this... This goes over here... And then the name... So that would mean... Old Man McGucket wrote the journals?!
|-

|''Cut to [[Mystery Shack]] Gift Shop.''

!Boombox
|''Am I blanchin',''
Girl we blanchin',

I live up in a mansion

Am I blanchin',

Girl we blanchin

I live up in a mansion
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|''(sings along, while sweeping broom across floor)''
Am I blanchin',

Girl we blanchin',

I live up in a mansion
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|Ugh! I can't get that terrible song out of my head.
|-
!Soos
|Oh, you mean "[[Straight Blanchin']]" by 'Lil Big Dawg? It's the catchiest song of the summer.
|-
!Wendy
|What is "blanchin"? Rappers can't just make up words!
|-
!Soos
|Rappers are visionaries, Wendy. If they told me to eat my own pants, I would do it.
|-
!Boombox
|''Eat your own pants. Eat your own pants, yeah!''
|-
!Soos
|I guess I have no choice. ''(unzips pants, and hums)'' Doot, do-do!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(run inside)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy, Soos, we need to go see Old Man McGucket!
|-
!Mabel
|We'll explain on the way! ''(everyone runs outside)''
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|Hey, what about work? Kids! ''(pauses)'' Why is Soos eating his own pants?
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Gravity Falls Junkyard|junkyard]]. The group is searching for McGucket.''
|-
!Dipper
|Old Man McGucket, are you here?
|-
!Soos
|Here hillbilly-billy-billy-billy.
|-
![[Nate]]
|''(standing in front of graffiti that says "McSuckIt", laughing)'' That's good.
|-
![[Lee]]
|Took an hour to think of this, but it was worth it. Ha! ''(They run away)''
|-
!Old Man McGucket
|Get outta here, you salt lickin', hornswagglin!... McSuckit, they got me good. ''(Sees the group.)'' Visitors! Come, come. ''(He leads them inside.)'' Pull up some rusty metal. You're just in time for my hourly turf war with the hillbilly what lives in my mirror. ''(He yells at his reflection in a bathtub.)'' Quit starin' at me when I bathe!
|-
!Dipper
|You can drop the act, McGucket. I know you're the author. You studied the mysteries of this [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|town]] and wrote this book. ''(holds up Journal 3)''
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, you're the genius Dipper's been searching for all summer!
|-
!McGucket
|Uh, genius? I'm no genius. I've never done nothin' worthwhile in my life. Everyone knows I'm no good to nobody. I can't remember what I used to be, but I must've been a big failure to end up like this.
|-
!Soos
|But the laptop has your name on it.
|-
!Dipper
|What about this book? Are you sure you didn't write it? Here, look closely. ''(He flips through the journal.)''
|-
!McGucket
|I told you, I don't recall. Everything before 1982 is just a blur. Just a hazy... ''(The journal flips forward to an image of the Blind Eye, the symbol of the society appear in his irises. He shrieks)'' The Blind Eye! Robes, the men, my mind! They did something!
|-
!Dipper
|Who did?
|-
!McGucket
|I... oh, I don't recall.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, you poor old man! No wonder your mind's all.. '' (blows raspberry)'' You've been through something intense.
|-
!Dipper
|What if McGucket learned something he wasn't supposed to know, and someone, or something, messed with his mind? We've got to get to the bottom of this.
|-
!Wendy
|Think, dude. What is the earliest thing you can remember?
|-
!McGucket
|Uh, this is, I think. ''(He pulls down a newspaper article.)''
|-
!Wendy
|The [[Gravity Falls Museum of History|history museum]]!
|-
!Dipper
|That's where we're going.
|-
!
|''Cut to the group in a [[Soos' pick-up truck|car]]. "Straight Blanchin" is playing.''
|-
!Wendy
|Ugh, Soos! ''(Takes out the CD and tosses it out of the car window, pauses)'' I'll buy you a new one.
|-
!
|''Cut to the History Museum. Everyone enters through the windows.''
|-
!Soos
|Hello? Anyone here?
|-
!Dipper
|All right, keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious.
|-
!Mabel
|''(sighs)''
|-
!Wendy
|Mabel, are you okay? You just walked by a cat without petting it.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh Wendy, everything I look at reminds me of failed romances. That formaldehyde heart. That romantic diorama. Even this poster of my most recent ex-crush. ''(She pulls down a poster of [[Gabe Bensen|Gabe]], revealing a poster of [[Sev'ral Timez]].)'' Aw, come on!
|-
!Dipper
|''(To McGucket:)'' So your last memory was here. Anything coming back?
|-
!Soos
|Guys, look! ''(Down the hall, a shadowy figure runs away.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, who's there? ''(They run into a room filled with depictions of eyes.)''
|-
!McGucket
|Well kettle my corn. He vanish-ified.
|-
!Dipper
|It doesn't make sense. Where did he go?
|-
!McGucket
|I feel like all these eyeballs are a-watchin' me.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait... they are! Move aside.
|-
!McGucket
|''(Moves aside, revealing a central eye)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pushes it and a staircase forms behind the fireplace)'' A secret passageway.
|-
!McGucket
|We'll have to be stealthy. I'll hambone a message if there's trouble. ''(Slaps his arms and legs. Translation:)'' Coyotes are coming for our sweetbreads.
|-
!Dipper
|I have no idea what that means.
|-
!Everyone
|''(Goes down the staircase)''
|-
!Society of the Blind Eye
|''(chanting:) ''"Novus ordo seclorum"
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Who is the subject of our meeting?
|-
!Society member
|''(Lazy Susan is pulled out, blindfolded.)'' This woman.
|-
!Mabel
|Lazy Susan?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|What is it you have seen?
|-
!All members
|Speak!
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Uh, well, uh, I was leaving the diner, and I saw these little bearded doodads, and I was, like, "Bwaaa?"
|-
!Blind Ivan
|There, there. ''(Pulls [[Memory erasing gun|ray gun]] out of the box. The members pull down their hoods.)'' You won't be like "Bwaaa?" for much longer.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|What is that gizmo? It looks like a hair dryer. Are you guys barbers? ''(The Lead Member zaps her with the gun.) AAAAAH!''
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Lazy Susan, what do you know of little bearded men?
|-
!Lazy Susan
|My mind is cleared, thanks to the Society of the Blind Eye.
|-
!Society
|It is unseen!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh my gosh. They erased Lazy Susan's memory.
|-
!McGucket
|''(hamboning:)'' Oh, *&#*%!
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, are you seeing this? They just wiped Lazy Susan's memory!
|-
!Soos
|They should've wiped off that awful mascara. (Chuckles)
|-
!Mabel
|I think she looks beautiful, Soos!
|-
!Wendy
|She's doing the best she can, Soos!
|-
!Soos
|Whoa! Touched a nerve there.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Lazy Susan, how do you feel?
|-
!Lazy Susan
|''(Being led away)'' I feel great! I can't even remember what was wrong, or what I'm doing here, or if I'm a man or a woman!
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Your memories will be safe with us, buried in the Hall of the Forgotten. ''(Removes a tube from the memory erasing gun, and writes on it:)'' (Lazy) Susan Wentworth
|-
!Society
|''(chanting:)'' Into the Hall of the Forgotten. Into the Hall of the Forgotten. ''(talking and dispersing)'' Good chanting, boys. Have you been practicing?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Meeting adjourned.
|-
!Society member 1
|Unsee you later.
|-
!Society member 2
|Unsee you later!
|-
!Dipper
|Amazing. A secret society of evil mind erasers. I'll bet they erased your memory a long time ago. If we could find where your memories have been hidden, it could be the key to unlocking all the mysteries of Gravity Falls. All right, Mabel, Wendy, you two stay here and make sure those robe guys don't come back.
|-
!Wendy
|Whoo! Girl's club.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, you, me, and McGucket are gonna go find the Hall of the Forgotten.
|-
!
|''Soos' hat is sucked into pipe''
|-
!Dipper
|Follow that hat!
|-
!Society member
|Halt! Is someone there?
|-
!McGucket
|Aah! What do we do? Where do we go?
|-
!
|''Cut to them disguised as a diorama.''
|-
!Society member
|Man, these are really poorly made. I could've sworn I heard someone.
|-
!Society member 2
|Probably just the janitor kissing that wax settler woman again.
|-
!Society member
|Whoof! Remind me to erase that from my memory. ''(They leave)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whew! ''(Sees the hat)'' There it is. Hurry!
|-
!McGucket
|Honey fogelin', saltlickin' skullduggery.
|-
!Soos
|Man, you have got to teach me some of those old-man swear words.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Wendy in the main chamber''
|-
!Mabel
|''(sighs)'' I just don't get it, Wendy. I hug a lot, I can burp the alphabet, I have scratch and sniff clothing. Why does every boy leave me?
|-
!Wendy
|Pfft, who cares? Boys are the worst. You shouldn't get hung up, man.
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe I come on too strong, you know?
|-
!Wendy
|Well, what's your opener? Pretend I'm a boy. ''(She puts up her hair, giving herself a mustache.)'' Mmm, testosterone. ''(spits)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(loudly)'' HI! I'M MABEL! I'M TWELVE AND I OWN A [[Waddles|PIG]]! WANT TO GET MARRIED?!
|-
!Wendy
|''(laughs)'' Honestly, that was perfect. You should just forget about guys, man.
|-
!Mabel
|Wendy, that's it. Forget about guys! ''(She picks up the memory gun)'' I just need to type "summer romances" into this thing, and I won't feel bad about them anymore.
|-
!Wendy
|Whoa, hold up, Mabel. We don't even know what that thing does. You could accidentally erase, like, learning to read, or breathe, or...
|-
!Mabel
|Or one of those terrible summer songs you can't get out of your head?
|-
!
|''Cut to the boys in the Hall of the Forgotten. [[Memory tube]]s are stacked to the ceiling.''
|-
!Soos
|Whoa, look at all these tubes.
|-
!Soos
|People must've been getting their memories erased all over town.
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa, look at this. ''(Inserts a tube titled "[[Robbie Valentino|Robbie V.]] Memories" into a viewing machine)''
|-
!Blind Ivan
|''(off screen)'' Yes, Robbie, what is it that you have seen?
|-
! Robbie Valentino
|''(on screen)'' So I was attacked by this [[Rumble McSkirmish|magic kung fu guy]] that was throwing, like, balls of fire at me. I kicked his butt though.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Robbie, speak honestly.
|-
!Robbie
|I was saved by a 12-year-old.
|-
!Dipper
|Why are they erasing peoples' memories? I still don't get it.
|-
!McGucket
|Looky, fellers. ''(He points to a tube labelled "McGucket Memories")'' It's those words what people call me.
|-
!Soos
|Oh, dude, your memories. We did it!
|-
!McGucket
|Grabby, grabby. ''(He takes the tube, which sets off an alarm.)'' I got it!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Wendy and Mabel''
|-
!Wendy
|I don't know, Mabel. Are you really sure this is a good idea?
|-
!Mabel
|All ideas are good ideas! ''(Alarm goes off.)''
|-
!Wendy
|Do you hear that?
|-
!
|''Cut to the males''
|-
!McGucket
|The alarm in my brain is a-ringin' again. Ah!
|-
!Society member
|Halt! Who's there?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no!
|-
!Soos
|Run!
|-
!Society member
|Get back here! ''(Chases Dipper and Soos. McGucket hides.)''
|-
!McGucket
|Oh, you've really tarred it up now, Fiddleford. This is all your fault. ''(Pause)'' Why does my beard have a bandage? Does that even make sense? Why has no one pointed that out?
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, I think we're safe. ''(Hands reach out from the shadows and cover Dipper and Soos's eyes.)''
|-
!Soos
|We playing "Guess Who"? Dude, I know it's you, Dipper. Such big... strong hands.... ''(Everyone, including Mabel and Wendy, is tied to a pole)''
|-
!Blind Ivan
|You shouldn't have come here. We do not give up our secrets lightly.
|-
!Wendy
|Who are you bathrobe-wearing freaks?
|-
!Dipper
|Why are you doing this?
|-
!Mabel
|What's with your creepy British accent?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Well, I suppose we are going to erase your minds anyway. ''(One by one, the Society members unmask)''
|-
!Mabel
|[[Toby Determined]]?
|-
!Dipper
|[[Bud Gleeful]]?
|-
!Wendy
|That [[Sprott|farmer guy]]?
|-
!Soos
|Creepy [[Woodpecker guy|dude]] who married a woodpecker? You too? How's that marriage goin, by the way?
|-
!Woodpecker guy
|Oh, great, great. ''(whispering:)'' Not great.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|And you've never met me before. And if you had, you wouldn't remember. ''(He removes his hood, revealing a bald tattooed head and a red scar through one eye)'' I am Blind Ivan, and we are the Society of the Blind Eye. Formed many years ago by our founder... our founder... Does anyone remember who he was?
|-
!Bud Gleeful
|We've been usin' that ray on our own brains an awful lot.
|-
!Dipper
|Why would you do all this? What do you have to gain?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|As you have no doubt discovered, Gravity Falls is a town plagued with supernatural strangeness. No one knew how to stop the things that went bump in the night, so our founder invented the next best thing: a way for us to forget. We took it upon ourselves to help the troubled townsfolk by erasing the memories of the strange things they've seen. Now the people of Gravity Falls go about their lives ignorant and happy, thanks to us. And as a perk, we help ourselves forget things that trouble us. Everyone has something they'd rather forget. In fact, your own sister was about to use that ray on herself. Isn't that right?
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel? Seriously?
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha, maybe...
|-
!Dipper
|Don't you see? This is ruining lives! What about Old Man McGucket? He lives in a hut and talks to animals, thanks to you. Don't you feel bad about that?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Mmm, maybe a little. ''(Shoots himself with the ray)'' But not anymore. You won't be telling anyone else what you've learned here. Say good-bye to your summer. ''(He aims the ray gun at them)''
|-
!Soos
|Guys, if we're gonna forget everything, I got some stuff I wanna get off my chest. Mabel, for half the summer, I thought your name was Maple, like the syrup. No one corrected me!
|-
!Mabel
|I only love some of my stuffed animals, and the guilt is killing me!
|-
!Dipper
|Sometimes I use big words, and I don't actually know what they mean. I mean, I'm supposed to be the smart guy. If I'm not the smart guy, who am I?
|-
!Wendy
|Okay, I'm not actually laid back. I'm stressed, like, 24/7. Have you ''met'' my family?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Oh, stop being a bunch of babies. ''(McGucket jumps down and knocks away the gun.)'' Owie!
|-
!All
|McGucket?!
|-
!McGucket
|I raided the mining display for weapons. Now fight like a hillbilly, fellers!
|-
!
|''Everyone grabs a weapon: banjos, stuffed raccoons etc. Soos grabs an informational display about dysentery.''
|-
!Soos
|Oh, nobody better miss!
|-
!Blind Ivan
|They know too much. Don't let them escape!
|-
!Wendy
|''(attacking a society member)'' Get this song outta your head!
|-
!Soos
|Dysentery's gonna get you, dawg!
|-
!Dipper
|McGucket's memory tube.
|-
![[Tats]]
|Oh no you don't!
|-
!Dipper
|''(puts the memory tube into a transport tube. It zooms around the room.)'' Mabel, catch!

|I'll take that, thank you. Give it up, boy. You're no match for the unstoppable power of- ''(His rob is caught in the tube and rips off, leaving him in his underwear.)'' That's right, I don't wear nothin' under my robe. Not gonna apologize for that. Maybe y'all should apologize for bein' a bunch of prudes.
|-
!All
|Eew!
|-
!Soos
|Well, time to erase that forever. ''(He holds up the gun, but Blind Ivan snatches it.)''
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Give me that tube.
|-
!Dipper
|Never! That memory belongs to McGucket.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|The Society's secrets belong to us. ''(He has the group in a corner and points the ray at them.)'' End of the line. By tomorrow, this will all seem like a bad dream. Say goodbye to your precious memories. ''(He fires the gun)''
|-
!Dipper
|NO!! ''(He shields his eyes, but finds McGucket has jumped in front of the group, catching the ray.)'' McGucket, you took a bullet for me. ''(As McGucket gets shot with the ray again.)'' Oh my gosh! Are you okay?!
|-
!McGucket
|Okay as I'll ever be! ''(laughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|What?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|''(He keeps shooting at McGucket, who slowly walks toward him.)'' Why... isn't... this... working?
|-
!McGucket
|Hit me with your best shot, Baldy. But my mind's been gone for thirty-odd years. You can't break what's already broken!
|-
!
McGucket
|Say goodnight, Sally! ''(He headbutts Blind Ivan. The Society members are tied up)''
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Unhand us!
|-
!Mabel
|It isn't so fun being tied up, is it? Hey, wanna draw on their faces?
|-
!Blind Ivan
|What?
|-
!Mabel
|Tra-la-la... ''(She crosses out Ivan's "knowledge" tattoo and replaces it with "butts".)''
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Hey, stop that! That's not funny.
|-
!Dipper
|It's pretty funny.
|-
!Soos
|It's, like, objectively funny.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|We'll have our revenge. We'll never forget what you've done.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, I think you just might. ''(He holds up the ray gun.)'' Say cheese.
|-
!
|''Cut to the outside of the Museum. The Society members, in normal clothes, are walking out.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks for visiting the Museum for Gold Miner Appreciation Night. Be sure to tip the gold miner on your way out.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|I'm sorry, but what's my name? Where am I?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, might have overdone that one.
|-
!Mabel
|Your name is Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle. You're a traveling banjo minstrel, with a song in your heart, and funny tattoos on your head.
|-
!Blind Ivan
|Yes, I am Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle. Cheers! ''(walks away, singing)'' "Toot-toot is my name..."
|-
!Dipper
|All right, McGucket, are you ready to see your memories? Find out who you really are?
|-
!McGucket
|I'm not so sure. What if I don't like what I see?
|-
!Mabel
|We've come all this way. Go on.

|''McGucket puts the tube into the machine. An image pops up on the screen of McGucket, 30 years younger.)''
|-
!McGucket
|''(On tape)'' My name is Fiddleford Hadron McGucket, and I wish to unsee what I have seen.
|-
!All
|''(gasp'')
|-
!McGucket
|Sweet sarsaparilla.
|-
!Younger McGucket
|For the past year, I have been working as an assistant for a visiting researcher. He has been cataloging his findings about Gravity Falls in a series of journals. I helped him build a machine which he believed had the potential to benefit all mankind, but something went wrong. I decided to quit the project. But I lie awake at night, haunted by the thoughts of what I've done. I believe I have invented a machine that can permanently erase these memories from my mind. ''(He holds up the memory erasing ray.)'' Test subject One: Fiddleford. ''(He shoots it. The screen goes to static and comes back on)'' It worked! I can't recall a thing. ''(Static, lab is in disarray)'' I call it the Society of the Blind Eye. We will help those who want to forget by erasing their bad memories! ''(Static, McGucket is more disheveled and nervous.)'' Today, I came across a colony of little men, very disturbing. I would like to forget seeing this. ''(Static. McGucket's lab is a mess and his arm is in a cast.)'' I accidentally hit another car in town today. I feel terri-bibble! Terrible. I've been forgetting words lately. I wonder if there are any negative side effects... ''(static. McGucket has a beard and is filming from a motel.)'' I saw [[Gobblewonker|something]] in [[Lake Gravity Falls|the lake]], something big! ''(static) ''My hair's been a-fallin' out, so I got this hat from a scarecrow. Hey, are my pants on backwards? ''(static. McGucket is wild-eyed and filming from the junkyard. Maniacally giggling and speaking gibberish:)'' Yroo Xrksvi! Girzmtov! ''(which is Atbash for:)'' [[Bill Cipher]]! Triangle! ''(The tape ends.)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, McGucket, I'm so sorry.
|-
!McGucket
|Aw, hush. You kids helped me get my memories back, just like you said.
|-
!Mabel
|But did you want those memories back?
|-
!McGucket
|After all these years, I finally know who I am. Maybe I messed up in the past, but now that I seen what happened, I can begin to put myself together again. ''(Hamboning:)'' Thanks for opening my eyes.
|-
!Dipper
|Still don't know what that means. So, wait. You weren't the author, but you worked with him. Do you remember who he was?
|-
!McGucket
|It's beginning to come back, but I need more time. And reading glasses. Heck! ''(spits)'' I got some rememberin' to do.
|-
!Wendy
|So Mabel, you still wanna erase those failed summer romances?
|-
!Mabel
|You know, no one likes having bad memories, but maybe it's better to remember the bad things and learn from them than to go all denial crazy trying to forget.
|-
!Wendy
|That's some mature junk right there, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Yep. Miss Mature. That's me. Hey, you wanna help me vandalize this picture of my jerky ex-crush? ''(They all doodle on a picture of Gabe.)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(They get into the car.)'' Hey, you know what? Going on this big adventure actually made me get that stupid song out of my head.
|-
!Soos
|Nice. ''(Starts the car. "Straight Blanchin" plays.)''
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, come on!
|-
!
|''Credits''
|-
!McGucket
|''(sitting in the back of the car with Dipper. Flipping through the journal.)'' It's all so familiar. It's almost like I can remember...
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan in his [[Underground laboratory|lab]], working on the [[universe portal]]''
|-
!Stan
|''(Pouring fuel)'' All right, you're getting closer. Every day it's getting stronger. ''(A gust of wind grabs his notebook and mug and sucks them into the portal.)'' Haha, yes! ''(A flying pipe hits his hand.)'' Ah! ''(Bandaging the bloody wound)'' I don't care if it's dangerous. I don't care how long it takes. I'm gonna pull this off, and no one's gonna get in my way! ''(Focus on a picture of Dipper and Mabel)''

|I've got to hand it to this perp, no one's broken out of the Infinitentiary before.

|Agh! Oh! ''(Choking)'' That was a mistake! ''(Collapses)''

|I don't know if we should be- ''(Takes out a membership card) ''Wo-oah! Soos has a membership to Laser Tag? Ha ha, I didn't know they let grown-ups in there.

|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading from driver's license:)'' "Jésus Alzamirano Ramirez. Organ donor. Birthday: July 13th." Wait a minute. That's today.
|-
!Mabel
|Woah...
|-
!Dipper
|That's weird. I wonder why he didn't tell anyone.
|-
!Mabel
|Uh-duh! It's probably because he wants someone to throw him a surprise party; I can relate. I've been waiting for a surprise party my whole life.
|-
![[Candy Chiu]]
|''(Walks up and throws confetti on her)'' Surprise!
|-
!Mabel
|Too little, too late, Chiu.

|Wow, you guys thought of everything!
|-
!Mabel
|''(As Dipper puts a cake on the table)'' Grenda, twins are born birthday experts.

|Three, two, one... ''(Yanks blindfold off)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Sees party)'' Huh?
|-
!Dipper, Mabel and Grenda
|Surprise!
|-
!Mabel
|Happy birthday, you king on Earth! We got everything you love. Cake-flavored pizza, pizza-flavored cake, ''(Leading him to a tent labeled "Razzle-Dazzler")'' and one more treat...

|Hey, did you guys see Soos? What happened to--? ''(Sees party)'' Oh no. Oh no, no. Okay, you guys didn't know so it's not your fault, but Soos hates his birthday.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|What?
|-
!Wendy
|It's a total mystery. I guess he's been like this since he was a kid. Some weird personal biz.
|-
!Mabel
|There's gotta be something we can do!
|-
!Wendy
|We've tried everything.
|-
!Stan
|I even petitioned the government to have this day removed from calenders. Now I'm not allowed on airplanes. ''(Holds up mug shot of himself stamped "BANNED" and marked "DANGER FLIGHT RISK")''

!Soos

|-
!Wendy
|''(With others, watching him from behind the house)'' I don't know, guys. Maybe we should just leave him alone, you know?
|-
!Dipper
|No one should be alone on their birthday. There's gotta be a way to cheer him up. We just have to try harder.
|-
!Mabel
|You're right, Dipper! It's time for us to bring out the big guns!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Big Gunz Laser Tag]]. Dipper, Mabel, Soos, Stan, Wendy, Candy, and Grenda are walking in.''
|-
!Soos
|''(With blindfolds on)'' Alright, guys. Blindfold me once, shame on you. Blindfold me twice- wait a minute. Hot dog smell? Sticky floors? Future sounds? ''(Takes off blindfold)'' Laser tag? I-I love laser tag. How'd you guys know?
|-
!Mabel
|Um, we definitely didn't rifle through your wallet? ''(Awkwardly laughs)''
|-
!Laser Tag Announcer
|Welcome to the year 8000. Society: collapsed. Fog machines: everywhere.

|Are these walls just mattresses spray painted purple?

!Stan
|Think this place used to be a mattress store.

|I-I don't know, guys. I'm not sure I'm up to this today.
|-
!Dipper
|Don't worry, Soos. As soon as you start playing with us, you're gonna have a great time.
|-
!Mabel
|We promise, no matter what happens, we won't leave your side.
|-
!Soos
|Well, I guess I could give it a shot.
|-
!Laser Tag Announcer
|Prepare for laser battle! In three, two, ''(Writing on billboard: "GO!" as buzzer sounds)''

!Dipper
|Soos!

|''(Mabel kicks the wall repeatedly)''
|-
!Lolph
|Nice try. But that's solid time-tanium, kid! There's only one way out of here!
|-
!Blendin
|Through me... ''(Shows only Blendin's head and hands)'' Oh, uh, ''(He fiddles with and punches his wristwatch as his [[Camouflage suit|uniform]] alternates through scenery)'' Sorry... C-come on... ''(Uniform turns to his normal gray suit)'' Through me! And that's, what it would be like if I'd just...gotten it right the very first chance, but it's still as effective.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel gasp''
|-
!Mabel
|The time traveler guy! What did you say your name was again? Blendo... Blondin...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Snaps fingers)'' Blar-blar!
|-
!Mabel
|There it is!
|-
!Blendin
|It's Blendin! Blendin Blenjamin Blandin! How could you not know my name after you ruined my life?
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel look at each other, confused.''
|-
!Blendin
|Initiate flashback! ''(Presses button on wristwatch, and a holographic screen is projected)'' It was after you [[The Time Traveler's Pig|stole my time device to win your stupid pig]]! I was cast out of the Time Anomaly Removal Crew; my whole life's purpose. ''(On screen: a hand rips off Blendin's name tag, and his suit turns into a prison design)'' And then I was given ten squared life sentences in time prison. I spent every day since then planning my vengeance. ''(On screen: Blendin shapes mashed slop like Dipper and Mabel's faces, then squishes them. Turns off flashback)'' And now finally, it has come!
|-
!Dipper
|Look, we're sorry about all that, but we're in the middle of something really important right now.
|-
!Mabel
|It's our friend's birthday today, and we promised we wouldn't leave his side!
|-
!Blendin
|What? You think some dumb birthday matters right now? Do you know where you are? Welcome...to Globnar!
|-
!
|''The far end of the room opens to show the Globnar arena. Events are taking place, like falling through portals, being set on fire, fighting a glob monster, battling on a moving clock, and fighting one another with age-altering weapons.''
|-
!Mabel
|Is this a reality show? Are we in Japan?
|-
!Blendin
|It's gladiatorial time combat!
|-
!
|''A man in a green future suit falls down, and another is lifted up by a rock and given a [[Time Wish]].''
|-
!Blendin
|The winner gets a precious Time Wish, and then decides the loser's fate!
|-
!Loser
|''(Shaking with fear)'' N-n-no! Please!
|-
!Winner
|''(Holds up a thumbs-up, then changes it to thumbs-down and smiles. Loser screams while being vacuumed away by a purple beam of light)'' ''(Dipper and Mabel look on in horror)''
|-
!Blendin
|And the two of you are officially challenged. Dundgren! Get me my war-paint.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, we need a way out of here! But how?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sees Lolph with a [[Tape measure time machine|time device]])'' I have an idea.
|-
!Mabel
|Hang in there Soos, we're coming for you.
|-
!
|''Cut back to laser tag at Big Guns''
|-
!Soos
|Dipper? Mabel? Requesting backup! Ah! Oh! Ah, Ah! Oh no! ''(Gets hit by several lasers from all directions)''

Your great-great-great-''(Looks at Dipper questioningly, who signals her to keep going)''-great-great-great-''(as Dipper holds up his hand in a stop gesture)''-great grandmother! From the past times.

|-
!Lolph
|Gam Gam! How could you?
|-
!Mabel
|I ain't no one's Gam Gam, sucka! You just got time-tricked!
|-

|-
!Mabel

|-
!Dipper
|Okay! I think...I've...got it! ''(Lets go of tape and links arms with Mabel. They disappear and reappear in midair)''

!Dipper and Mabel
|Ahhh! ''(Fall and land on mattress)''
|-
!Mabel
|Uh... Are we back?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, no, look! Mabel, the laser place is a [[Mr. Zzz's Mattresses|mattress store]]! We went too far in the past!
|-
!Mabel
|Time travel, man! Why you gotta be so complicated?
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel duck under a bad as Blendin, Lolph, and Dundgren land on a bed close by''
|-
!Dundgren
|It looks like they overshot their destination by 10 years.
|-
!Blendin
|I don't see them. ''(Wipes off face-paint)'' You better find those kids!
|-
!Lolph
|You'll get your justice, Blendin.
|-
!Blendin
|I'm gonna keep stammering until you find them! I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I...!
|-
!Lolph
|I hate that guy.
|-
!Dundgren
|Let's move.
|-
!Lolph and Dundgren
|''(Jump and flip over the mattresses and land in front of the door)'' Yeah! ''(Fist bump, they walk out the door)''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay. We just gotta to go forward 10 years. We can be back before Soos even realizes we were gone.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh no! ''(Looks at time machine, which is dented and and radiates blue electricity)'' The timey thing, it's busted! Can you fix it?
|-
!Dipper
|M-m-maybe. I need some tools. And I think I know where to get some.
|-

|''Pan to sign reading "MYSTERY SHACK 1 mile"''

|''(Shakes Dipper)'' Dipper, Dipper. Look. ''(Turns Dipper's face towards Soos)''
|-
!Dipper
|No. Way.
|-
!
|''Soos looks at a Mystery Shack staff shirt, then at his own wishfully.''
|-
![[Abuelita]]
|Mi precioso. You keep wandering off. You don't want to be late for your big day.
|-
!Soos
|''(Walking out with his grandmother, holding her hand)'' Sorry, Abuelita.
|-
!Mabel
|Big day? This could be the birthday where that personal biz went down. We could finally find out why Soos hates his birthday.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks at time travel device)'' Alright. But let's be quick.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos' house, with a birthday party in the backyard. Dipper and Mabel are spying on the party from behind bushes.''
|-
!Kid
|''(Running with friends)'' I want a piece of birthday cake!
|-
![[Soos' cousins|Cousin]]
|''(To Soos:)'' Who's a handsome birthday boy?
|-
!Cousin 2
|It's you!
|-
!Abuelita
|''(Carrying box. Laughs)'' Soos, you are such a lady's man.
|-
!Soos
|They're my cousins, grandma, gross.
|-
!Abuelita
|''(Opens box)'' I got you a racecar cake.
|-
!Dipper
|Man, I don't know why Soos hate his birthdays, this looks great.
|-
!Soos
|''(Licking frosting off of racecar. He sees a kid takes a seat at the head of the table)'' Uh, sorry dude, but could you move seats? That's the seat of honor.
|-
!Kid
|Uh, who's it for?
|-
!Soos
|Oh, heh. It's for my dad actually. I haven't seen him in like... eight years. But he's coming today! ''(Hears doorbell ring)'' That must be him! ''(Wipes face and rearranges party hat. Runs to the door as Mabel and Dipper follow, looking in through a window. Soos breathes in and out)'' Alright Soos. Today's the big day. Be cool. Be. Cool. ''(Opens door)''
|-
!Mailman
|Postcard for... ''(Looks at postcard)'' ...Soos.
|-
!Soos
|''(Takes postcard which says "Hello! from New Orleans", the same postcard present Soos was holding earlier. Reading backside:)'' "Sorry, champ. Couldn't make it this year. Real busy again. See you next year for sure. Dad."
|-
![[Reggie]]
|Hey, don't sweat it, cuz. You'll see him next year.
|-
!Soos
|Heh, yeah. Next year. ''(Pulls out a box of postcards, all from different places: Massachusetts, New York, and all seem to have the same message. Puts postcard in box)'' Uh, I'm gonna go lay down. You party without me dudes. ''(Walks away)''
|-
!Abuelita
|Wait! What about your presents? ''(Picks up present and pushed a key through the paper which makes a "Yayah!" similar to Soos' keyboard machine in [[Double Dipper]])''
|-
!Dipper
|So ''that's'' why Soos hates his birthday. It's the day he realized his dad wasn't coming back.
|-
!Mabel
|So, how much partying can fix that
|-
!Robbie
|''(Shoots Dipper in face with a water gun)'' Heheh, dorks. Young Robbie!
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos, sitting glumly in his room''
|-
!Abuelita
|''(Outside the room, to herself)'' Ay, Soos' father is a deadbeat! ¡Si alguna vez muestra su carota por aquí, se la voy a partir pieza por pieza! ''(Subtitled: "If he ever shows his face here again, I'll tear him limb from limb!")'' Ahem. ''(Walks into room)'' Soo-oo-oos. I made you cookies shaped like dinosaurs.
|-
!Soos
|I don't want cookies. I wanna see Dad again.
|-
!Abuelita
|And he wants to see you, he's just... busy.
|-
!Soos
|Busy in New Orleans...
|-
!Abuelita
|Aye, yes...Trust me. You ''will'' feel better someday.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Spying through window with Dipper)'' Ugh, this is awful.
|-
!Dipper
|We promised Soos a happy birthday, but how can we give him that now? This goes beyond anything we know how to fix.
|-
!Blendin
|''(Offscreen)'' Th-this way!
|-
!Dipper
|Uh-oh. Hide!
|-
!
|''Lolph, Blendin and Dundgren walk to where Dipper and Mabel had been hiding.''
|-
!Blendin
|They've gotta be around here somewhere. I-I-I think I heard them! ''(Looks at tree)''
|-
!Lolph
|Freeze! ''(Shoots laser gun at tree, which blows up, revealing Robbie, who runs away crying)'' Trace their chrono-signatures.
|-
!Blendin
|Man, the sooner I defeat those kids in Globnar, the sooner I can win my time wish.
|-
!Dundgren
|Tell you what I'd do if I had a time wish. Retire early. Spend more time with the kids.
|-
!Blendin
|Naing Niang Niang Niang Niang, with the kids! Don't you know a time wish can do literally anything? Any impossible problem solved ''(Snaps finger)'' just like that? I mean, imagine the possibilities.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, Mabel, that's it! The time wish! If we defeat Blendin in that space battle...
|-
!Mabel
|...Then we can wish that Soos' dad came to his twelfth birthday!
|-
!Dipper
|And Soos' birthdays would be fixed forever. ''(Snaps finger)'' All of them.
|-
!Mabel
|But do you really think we can win Globnar?
|-
!Dipper
|It's the only chance we have. Besides, it's for Soos. He would do the same for us. ''(Walks out from behind tree with Mabel)'' Here we are Blendin. We surrender.
|-
!Blendin
|It's them!
|-
!Dundgren
|Freeze! ''(Points laser gun at them)''
|-
!Lolph
|''(Pulling out his own gun)'' Careful, they're from the past. They might have powder muskets or slap bracelets.
|-
!Dipper
|Look guys, no tricks this time. We're ready to challenge you, okay?
|-
!Blendin
|Yes! Let the Globnar begin! Prepare... for... GLOBNAAA- ''(Blendin's voice is cut off and a green mute symbol appears in front of his mouth)''
|-
!Lolph
|Hey, turns out I can mute him.
|-
!Dundgren
|Man, I wish we'd known that earlier.
|-
!Lolph
|Initializing! ''(Presses button wrist, and the group disappears in a flash of white, leaving a red screwdriver behind)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the Globnar arena. The group reappears inside. The crowd is shouting "Globnar" repeatedly, punching their fists in the air, and the group is shown on a large screen at the edge of the arena. A large hole opens up one one end of the arena, and the Time Baby floats up out of it.''
|-
!Time Baby
|Silence! ''(Most of the arena hushes)''
|-
!Globnar Fan
|Wooh! Oh yea!
|-
!
|''The Time Baby shoots Globnar fan with laser vision.''
|-
!Mabel
|That is one big baby.
|-
!Time Baby
|''(Raising hands)'' Welcome Globnar tributes! I have a very important nap to get to so let's make this quick. You each have a chance to settle your time-feud through gladiatorial combat.
|-
!Robot
|''(Carrying a baby bottle shaped like a hourglass and filled with a universal-textured substance)'' You will have until Time Baby finishes drinking the cosmic sand in this hourglass. ''(Moves to Time Baby)''
|-
!Time Baby
|No!
|-
!Robot
|Come on. ''(Pokes Time Baby with bottle)''
|-
!Time Baby
|Ow!
|-
!Robot
|It's good for you. ''(Pokes Time Baby with bottle)''
|-
!Time Baby
|Wah!
|-
!Blendin
|Get ready, kids. When I get that time wish, you'll wish you were never born. Or rather, you'll wish you were born, because I'm gonna wish you were never born!
|-
!Dipper
|Dream on. There's two of us.
|-
!Mabel
|And we have hair!
|-
!Blendin
|Oh-oh, yeah? Well I have training! ''(Twirls spear)'' What do you think I did in prison all that time?
|-
!Mabel
|Uh oh.
|-
!Time Baby
|Let the Globnar... BEGIN!
|-
!
|''Lightning is seen and a scoreboard lights up, giving each team zero points. Blendin's, Dipper's, and Mabel's handcuffs fall off. Blendin screams and the camera pans into his mouth.''
|-
!
|''Cut to various Globnar events: Blendin and Dipper fighting with sticks, Blendin pushes Dipper away and Mabel jumps at him, and he knocks her away as well. Blendin jumpes over the hands on the clock, but they trip Dipper and Mabel over and Blendin gets a point. ; Blendin and the twins each have futuristic cycles that can defy gravity. The twins' do a wheelie and speed up, crossing the finish line first and gaining a point. ; Cut to Dipper and Blendin playing a strange game, which is interrupted by a monster with a clock for a face. After a while of playing then two reams are tied at 244. A quick montage of images flash of other contests: Blendin chasing the kids on a giant wheel, Mabel and Blendin having a "time dog" eating contest, the tributes fighting in robotic cuckoo clock suits, having a wheelbarrow race, Mabel and Blendin fighting with spears on unicycles on a tightrope while Dipper swims through clocks to get away from a time shark, and the three playing a game that resembles a giant Jenga. A clock is seen and an announcer sings "Globnar." The tributes are seen working together and pushing the clock-faced monster through a door in the wall.''
|-
!Time Baby
|Very good. You have escaped the [[Cyclocks]].
|-
!Blendin
|Yes! Blendin for the almost-win!
|-
!
|''The score is shown to be 764 to 763, Blendin.''
|-
!Time Baby
|There is only one final challenge for Globnar. An ancient game, thousands of years old, chosen for its exemplification of pure strategy: The ancient art... of Laser Tag!
|-
!
|''A course and laser guns appear.''
|-
!Time Baby
|The one who touches the victory orb first will win!
|-
!Dipper
|Laser tag? Seriously?
|-
!Blendin
|Oh, I know it doesn't seem that challenging now, but just wait till they turn on that fog machine. You'll be done for! You just wait until ya--
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shoots him multiple times, making the vest say "Hit!")''
|-
!Blendin
|Aw, man.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, grab the orb!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs up to the top of the pyramid to the orb)'' Got it! ''(Touches it and everything goes white)''
|-
!Time Baby
|''(He finishes drinking the cosmic sand)'' It is finished!
|-
!Robot
|''(Pats the Time Baby's back and he burps)''
|-
!
|''The crowd cheers and the kids' score goes up to 999.''
|-
!Blendin
|No! No! No! No! Nooooo!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(High five)'' Yes!
|-
!Time Baby
|You have made victory in Globnar. Before I give you your time wish, tell us; what fate have you decided for the loser?
|-
!Blendin
|Oh, jeez...
|-
!Mabel
|Death!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel!
|-
!Mabel
|Sorry. Got carried away...
|-
!Dipper
|So Blendin did try to wish us out of existence, but it was kind of our fault for ruining his life.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, and he's kind of too sad to be a real bad guy.
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe if we treat him right in the present, he'll turn out better in the future. ''(To Time Baby:)'' Okay. As long as you keep an eye on him, we'd like to set Blendin free, and restore his position at the Time Anomaly Correction Unit.
|-
!Mabel
|And give him pretty hair!
|-
!Time Baby
|So be it.
|-
!Blendin
|''(Handcuffs fall off)'' Wh-what? You'd do that for me? ''(Mustache-shaped hair grows on his head)'' I got my job back! ''(Places hand on Lolph's chest)'' I feel like hugging somebody.
|-
!Lolph
|I can kill you in eight different ways.
|-
!Blendin
|''(Removes hand)'' Yes, sir.
|-
!Time Baby
|''(Rubbing face)'' Now, children. What is it that you want for your time wish?
|-
!
|''A glowing orb floats down between Dipper and Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|Thank you, but the wish... isn't for us.
|-
!Time Baby
|Not you? But then who? Who is worthy to receive such power?
|-
!
|''Cut to Big Gunz Laser Tag.''
|-
!Soos
|Dipper? Mabel? Aw, who am I kidding? I'm not up for this ''(Goes towards exit and takes out coin)'' Heads I stay, tails I go make myself some dinosaur shaped cookies. ''(Flips coin)''
|-
!
|''A kid is drinking from a water fountain when time starts to slow down. Two kids playing in the laser tag arena also slow down and stop. Soos's coin stops in mid-air.''
|-
!Soos
|Huh. That's... unconventional.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(They appear with Blendin)'' Soos!
|-
!Soos
|G-guys!
|-
!Dipper
|We're so sorry we left you hanging dude. We got caught up in this time travel junk--
|-
!Mabel
|And there was a time cyclops--
|-
!Dipper
|And don’t forget about the--
|-
!Mabel
|Heheh.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Time race!
|-
!Mabel
|But, the point is, Soos, we think we know how to fix your birthday.
|-
!Soos
|Woah, really? Wait, you guys did all of that... for me?
|-
!Blendin
|And that's not all. ''(Presses button on wristwatch and the time wish appears)'' Behold your time wish! The power to alter time paradox free in any way you choose.
|-
!Dipper
|We think the only thing that can make you happy is meeting your dad.
|-
!Mabel
|But the choice is yours.
|-
!Soos
|You mean I can finally see my dad by touching this thing? And you guys battled through time and space just to get this for me? ''(Takes out postcard from New Orleans)''
|-
!Dipper
|What are you waiting for, Soos?
|-
!Soos
|''(Glances at postcard then puts it away)'' Alright, here goes nothing. ''(Places hand on time wish and it gives off white light. When the light clears, Mabel and Dipper get cleaned from their battles.)''
|-
!Dipper
|What the--?
|-
!Mabel
|Wait what?
|-
!Soos
|Bam! I fixed you dudes up.
|-
!Dipper
|But Soos, what about meeting your dad?
|-
!Soos
|Well, birthdays are supposed to be spent with the people who care about you. But you know what, that dude didn’t care about me enough to visit me once, let alone fight monsters through time and space like you dudes. I mean, you had a gladiator fight, just to make me happy. I've been being ridiculous this whole time. Whoever my dad was, he can take a hike. ''(Throws postcard)'' I know who my family is now, and it’s you dudes. ''(Hugs the twins)'' Thanks for giving me the best birthday ever.
|-
!Blendin
|Are you kidding me?! Do you have any idea what you’ve just wasted?! Do you how many have died to get the time wish; the wars that were started?!
|-
!Soos
|Oh that’s not all dude. ''(Holds up slice of pizza)'' I also wished for this [[Infinite pizza slice|slice of infinite pizza]]. Watch. ''(Takes bite of pizza, which regenerates)'' And it can do that for like...infinity.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh yeah, okay, cool.
|-
!Blendin
|Okay, yeah. Phew. That’s a good time wish!
|-
!Soos
|There’s still ten minutes before Laser Tag closes. You dudes wanna play?
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah.
|-
!
|''Dipper, Mabel and Soos run into Laser Tag zone, laughing.''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Happy birthday, Soos!
|-
!
|''Cut to Credits Scene. It is 2002 and Soos is in his backyard.''
|-
!Soos
|Whoa. Though I heard an explosion. ''(Sees screwdriver dropped by Dipper)'' Whoa, what’s this. ''(Reading print on screwdriver:)'' "Mystery Shack."
|-
!
|''Cut to Mystery Shack''
|-
!Stan
|''(Throwing [[Deputy Durland|Durland]] outside.)'' "That is it! You are singlehandedly the worst handyman I've ever seen."
|-
!Soos
|Uh, hey. Excuse me sir.
|-
!Stan
|Hey you, gumdrop. Think you can fix a [[Mystery Cart|golf cart]]?
|-
!Soos
|Well, uh. I don’t know if I--
|-
!Stan
|''(Throws Staff shirt on Soos)'' Boom. You’re hired. One size fits all. ''(To crowd:)'' Step right up to the Mystery Shack folks, step right up...

|''(In the video:)'' Who's ready to fall in love tonight? ''(The crowd cheers and he stumbles face-first into the camera)'' Whoa! Ow! I hope nobody's filming this!

!Dipper
|Whoa! Like a real ''concert'' concert? I've never actually been to one of those before. ''(Brushes elbow)''

!Robbie
|What? No way! ''(Glances at picture of Wendy and then quickly hides it)''

!Wendy
|''(Rubbing the back of her neck nervously)'' Robbie, we split up forever ago. It's really sweet you'd throw yourself into a grave for me but, man, time to move on.

|-
!Dipper
|Come on, Mabel, it's Robbie.
|-
!Mabel
|But he's suffering. How can I be happy if I know someone else is sad? It totally throws off my happiness chart.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, trust me. If there's one thing I've learned this summer, it's not to get mixed up in needless romantic drama. ''(Whispering:)'' Besides, we're finally in with Wendy's friends. With Robbie gone, there's a good social balance. Maybe we should let the good thing be, you know.
|-
!Robbie
|''(To a nearby vulture:)'' Just eat me already, man. ''(Vulture squawks and attacks)'' Ah! I was just being dramatic! Quit it! Ow! Ow! My face! Vulture!

|''Cut to the [[Mystery Shack]], where Wendy and the twins are.''
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, man. I'm sorry you guys had to see that.
|-
!Mabel
|You know what Robbie needs? A new girl! Romance is like gum. Once it's lost its flavor, you just cram another one in. ''(Chews wad of gum)''
|-
!Wendy
|Mabel, it's not that easy.
|-
!Mabel
|It is if you're the world's greatest matchmaker! I've never had an unhappy customer; like [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] and [[Melody]].

!
|''Cut to Soos, who is standing behind a cardboard box, video chatting with Melody.''

!Soos Ramirez
|Watch this. ''(As he gradually bends down behind the cardboard box:)'' Walking down some actual stairs. ''(Melody giggles; from behind the box:)'' Did it look cool?
|-
!Melody
|''(Giggles)'' The coolest.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Mabel, Wendy and Dipper.''
|-
!Mabel
|Match made! And then, of course, there's [[Waddles]] and [[Gompers]].
|-
!
|''Pan to Gompers, who is wearing a wedding veil made of saran wrap. Tin cans are tied to him with string and Waddles duck taped to his side. Wedding music plays, Gompers bleats, and then eats the saran wrap-veil.''

|-
!Wendy
|That might work for a goat and a pig, but Robbie's a hopeless case.
|-
!Mabel
|Hopeless case, ehhh?
|-
!
|Cut to right outside of the Mystery Shack, where [[Stan Pines|Stan]] is standing on a ladder, sewing a rainbow afro onto a stuffed gorilla.

|-
!
|''A van pulls up. A [[Unnamed singing hippie|Woodstick attendee]] is sitting on top of it, playing his guitar and singing a [[Singing by the Open Road|song]].''
|-
![[Unnamed singing hippie|Woodstick attendee]]
|''(Singing:)'' Singing by the open road. My sandals are so open toed.
|-
!Stan
|Folk music! It's the Woodstick Festival! Soos! ''(Rummaging through a suitcase full of various medieval weapons as Soos comes out)'' Lock down the shack and hide my shirts before anyone tie-dyes them! ''(Pulls out a crossbow and aims them at the hot air balloons)'' They're slow. I could probably take a few down.
|-
!Soos
|Wait, Mr. Pines! ''(Moving Stan's crossbow out of the way as the arrow flies off; a bird caws off-screen)'' I've been thinking. Every year this festival comes by and every year you shun what could be potential customers.
|-
!Stan
|You really think I could make money off of these free-loading, kale-munching freak shows?
|-
!Soos
|You just gotta figure out what appeals to them.
|-
!Stan
|Hmm. How do I appeal to young people? So young people are into hot air balloons, ehh?
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel at the front door of the [[Valentino Funeral Home|Valentino household]].''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, Mabel. Robbie's a broken teacup and you're going to piece him back together. ''(Rings doorbell)'' Okay, this could get intense. ''(The door opens and she gasps)''
|-
![[Greg and Janice Valentino|Mr. and Mrs. Valentino]]
|Howdy do!
|-
!Mrs. Valentino
|Happy day!
|-
!Mabel
|It ''is'' intense. ''You're'' Robbie's parents? I always thought he was, like, raised by sad wolves or something.
|-
!Mr. Valentino
|Oh, well, he doesn't like to talk about us. He always says we're too cheerful for funeral directors. ''(Both laugh)'' Come in. Come in.
|-
!
|''Cut to the inside of the house. There is a glass coffin with a corpse in it. On top of it is a tray of crackers and grapes. Mr. Valentino grabs the tray and approaches Mabel, who is sitting on the couch.''

!Mr. Valentino
|Cracker platter?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, no time for crackers, sorry. I'm here to cheer Robbie up. Cannot have a dry cracker mouth for that.

!Mrs. Valentino
|''(Walking to the bottom of the staircase with a plate of spaghetti in her hands; calling up to Robbie:)'' Robbie Stacey Valentino! There's a little girl here to see you. ''(To Mabel:)'' You go on up. ''(Hands Mabel spaghetti plate)'' And could you bring him his lunch?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Seeing that the sauce and meatballs on the spaghetti are shaped into a smile)'' Lady, I like your style. ''(Giggles and heads upstairs)''
|-
!Mrs. Valentino
|You know who would look good in a sweater like that? Mrs. Grabelson's remains!
|-
!Mr. Valentino
|Oh, absolutely!
|-
!
|''Cut to the upstairs floor, where Mabel is walking by pictures of Robbie from over the years. She stops at his bedroom door.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Knocks on door)'' Robbie! It's Mabel!
|-
!Robbie
|''(From inside his room:)'' Who?
|-
!Mabel
|Remember me? I'm like girl-Dipper!
|-
!Robbie
|''(From inside his room:)'' Ugh, go away!
|-
!Mabel
|I heard a come in! ''(Opens the door, turning on the lights as she enters the room)''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Recoiling at the bright lights)'' Agh, hey! Listen, kid. Nobody in the Pines family is welcome here. In case you forgot, your stupid brother is the one who ruined my life!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Setting down Robbie's lunch and pulling up a chair to sit)'' And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it. Listen, Robbie, I always used to see you as a creepy jerk, like the human version of rat poison.
|-
!Robbie
|''(A bit flattered by the comparison)''Uh, go on. ''(Taking a seat on his bed, across from Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|But when I saw you in the cemetery today, I realized, Robbie's not a bad guy. He's just a heartbroken soul who needs love and gloves with fingers.
|-
!Robbie
|Hey, fingerless gloves look awesome!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Wagging a finger and chuckling)'' No they don't. Robbie, you just need a good matchmaker. I guarantee I'll find you true love or twice your sadness back.
|-
!Robbie
|''(Sighs)'' If I say yes, will you leave my room?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Zips Robbie's hoodie)'' I guarantee it.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel in her room, sitting in front of a miniature diorama of the [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|town]] and its residents.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Cracks knuckles)'' Okay, Gravity Falls, who wants to go out with Robbie? ''(Sorting through the wooden figures of the residents)'' Okay. [[Lazy Susan]]? Too old. [[Grenda]], too young. [[Multi-Bear]]? I'm putting you in the maybe pile. Who could it be? Who could it be? ''(Bleating and squealing from Gompers and Waddles)'' What's that Wompers? Someone we already know? But who could possibly be superficial and gothy enough for–? ''(Waddles squeals)'' Of course, that's it! You two really are America's favorite power couple.
|-
!
|''Cut to Thompson residence, inside the garage where Wendy and her friends and Dipper are.''
|-
!Lee & Nate
|''(Chanting as they duck tape snacks onto Thompson:)'' More snacks! More snacks!
|-
!Thompson
|I'm just happy to be included— ''(Nate puts tape over Thompson's mouth and Thompson's speech is muffled)''
|-
!Wendy
|Ha! This is brilliant. The perfect way to sneak cheap snacks into the concert, and it was all Dipper's idea.
|-
!Lee and Nate
|Woo! Nice.
|-
!Wendy
|Well done.
|-
!Nate
|Ideas!
|-
!Lee
|''(Bending down and placing a hand on Dipper's shoulder)'' Kid, I sense greatness in you.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Chuckles)'' Oh, well, I don't know about—
|-
!Lee
|''(Lifting Dipper up onto his shoulders)'' —Greatness!
|-
!Wendy
|Alright, now everyone go home and finish getting ready for the concert.
|-
!Nate
|Hey, don't wait up, Tambers.
|-
!Tambry
|Don't call me Tambers.
|-
!Nate
|''(Laughs)'' Classic Tambers.
|-
!Tambry
|''(Reading a text:)'' "Tambry, You. Me. Date. Bring that sweet, sweet bod. Your secret admirer."
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Greasy's Diner]], where Mabel is watching Robbie, who is quietly sitting in a booth.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(As [[Lazy Susan]] walks by her)'' Love is about to happen, Lazy Susan. Watch and learn.
|-
!
|''A bell rings as the door to the diner is opened. Tambry walks in and approaches the booth Robbie is sitting in.''
|-
!Tambry
|Ugh, Robbie? ''You're'' my secret admirer?
|-
!Robbie
|Tambry? Ugh, this is just what I get for trusting a toddler. Listen, I don't think this is gonna work out. Dating somebody I already know? It's kinda like admitting defeat.
|-
!Tambry
|Um, way to assume I'm even ''interested''.
|-
!Robbie
|Tambry, let's be real. If I wanted to date you I would have done it already. I'm just a little out of your league. ''(Noticing a mustard stain on the elbow of his sweatshirt)'' Whoa, is that mustard? Don't want to waste that bad boy. ''(Licks mustard stain)''
|-
!Tambry
|''(Pulling out her cell phone and typing)'' Status update: On blind date with sociopath.
|-
!Robbie
|Oh, sure, bring out the phone. Classic Tambers. ''(To a waiter:)'' Hey can I get some chili fries? To go.
|-
!Mabel
|What? How is this possible? I'm supposed to be the best matchmaker ever.
|-
!
|''Chattering among the patrons. "Let's go." "It's him." The door to the diner bursts open and Love God storms in.''
|-
!Love God
|Woo-hoo! Who's ready to fall in love tonight?
|-
!Patrons
|Love God! ''(Cheering)''
|-
!Love God
|''(Starts up the jukebox) ''That's what they call me. We're rewriting history tonight, and it starts with ''(as he points at a male patron and a female employee:)'' you and you! ''(The man and woman look at each other and start kissing)'' Love is real and it's in your ''face!'' ''(Chuckles; to an elderly, female patron:)'' What's your name, you little angel?
|-
![[Meredith]]
|''(Chuckles)'' Meredith.
|-
!Love God
|''(In a hurried whisper:)'' Meredith, Meredith. We got a problem. ''(Cut to a man sitting across from them)'' That cutie right there is your soul mate and you're living without him.
|-
!Meredith
|Oh, no. What do I do?
|-
!Love God
|Get it, girl. You know what you love. ''(Points at the man as Meredith runs off)'' Pow! Match made!
|-
!
|''Meredith runs towards the man, picks him up and laughs. Cut to Mabel, who is hiding behind a booth.''
|-
!Mabel
|I must know how this works.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel approaching Love God, who is stuffing a large sandwich into his mouth.''
|-
!Mabel
|Hi. Love God? Mabel here. Big fan. Can I just say, that was some of the finest matchmaking I've ever seen? Can you please, please tell me your secret?
|-
!Love God
|''(Licks his fingers)'' Well, between you and me, let's just say my name's not exactly a coincidence. ''(His wings flutter)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh. My. Love God. Are you an actual ''love god?''
|-
!Love God
|Call me a cherub. The internet pretty much does my job for me nowadays so I'm taking time to focus on my rock career. ''(Handing her a cassette)'' Boom. Cassette. Boom. For you.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh! That's... great. ''(Subtly drops the cassette)'' So, anyway. Can you make anything fall in love? Like that snake and that badger?
|-
!
|''Outside, through the window, a badger and snake are seen fighting, hissing and growling at each other.''
|-
!Love God
|Hmm, ah gee, I dunno. That might be kinda hard to—''(Points at the animals) ''Kaboom! Match made!
|-
!
|''The animals smile, the snake wraps itself around the badger and the badger walks away.''
|-
!Mabel
|They're gonna make a snadger. How are you doing that?
|-
!Love God
|[[Love potions|Love potion]], yo. I got it all. Summer love. Young love. Anti-love. You just gotta put a little on your fingers and pow!
|-
!Mabel
|I need that potion. How much would it cost? ''(Grabbing a squirrel)'' And will you accept squirrels as payment?
|-
!Love God
|Whoa, no way. You might think you know what's best for people but this stuff can have major social consequences. That's why it can only be used by a serious expert.
|-
!Woman
|Love God! Sign my face!
|-
!Love God
|''(To woman:)'' Only if you sign mine, baby. Let's get weird! ''(They start kissing)''
|-
!
|''Mabel carefully takes a love potion off of Love God's belt as he is facing away from her and replaces the empty slot with a squirrel. She puts a finger over her mouth and shushes the squirrel as she leaves. Cut to the kitchen of the Greasy Diner, where a chef is finishing Robbie's order of fries. Mabel approaches, the love potion in her hand.''
|-
!Mabel
|Mind if I add a little something to these fries?
|-
!Chef
|''(Shrugging)'' I don't see why not.
|-
!
|''Mabel pours the contents of the potion onto the fries. Cut to Robbie and Tambry, who receive the fries.''
|-
!Robbie
|''(Taking a bite of a fry)'' Whoa. Did your whole thing suddenly get a lot more likable?
|-
!Tambry
|''(Taking a bite of a fry)'' You don't seem as needy as I used to think you were.
|-
!Robbie
|Hey, you wouldn't wanna maybe get outta here and, I don't know, go kiss in public a lot?
|-
!Tambry
|''(Taking his hand)'' For some reason, I do. ''(Pulls out phone and begins to type as Robbie plays with her hair)'' Status update—you know what? Forget it. ''(Puts phone down and grabs her purse)'' Maybe I should stare at something other than my phone for a while.
|-
!Mabel
|Match made!
|-
!
|''Cut to Thompson's garage, where Wendy, Dipper, Nate, Thompson and Lee are.''
|-
!Wendy
|All right. Who's ready for the best and most overpriced day of our summer?! ''(All cheer)''
|-
!Thompson
|''(Holding up trail mix and safety whistles)'' I brought a baggie of trail mix and safety whistles, in case we get separated.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pretending to clear throat:)'' Lame.
|-
!Lee
|This kid is a champion.
|-
!Nate
|We're just waiting on Tambry. Can't leave without Tambry.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Walks in, holding her happiness chart)'' Sorry, guys, but Tambry's a little busy at the moment. Wink. Wink.
|-
!Nate
|''(Nervously:)'' What does that mean? Why are you winking?
|-
!Mabel
|Let's just say she and Robbie took a trip to Smoochville. Now everyone's happy.
|-
!Nate
|Wait, wait. Robbie and Tambry? This can't be happening.
|-
!Mabel
|How's that?
|-
!Nate
|He knew I liked her! How could he do this?
|-
!Lee
|Whoa, hold it. You like Tambry and you told Robbie but not ''me''?
|-
!Nate
|You always make fun of my crushes, man.
|-
!Lee
|''(Wacking Nate's head)'' That's what we do, genius.
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, oh! This is so like Tambry to do this. Date my ex behind my back. ''(Pulling her hair)'' I'm gonna tear her highlights out.
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, guys. Calm down. We're gonna be late for the concert.
|-
!Nate
|Uh, news flash, kid. I'm not going to the concert. ''(Pointing to Lee)'' Not with him.
|-
!Lee
|Hey, that won't be a problem 'cus I'm out.
|-
!Wendy
|Me, too!
|-
!Thompson
|''(Frantically, as everyone but the twins leaves:)'' Wait! Wait! This group is all I have! Don't make me go back to having no friends! Guys!
|-
!Mabel
|Match made? ''(All the stickers on her happiness chart fall off)''
|-
!Thompson
|Wait, guys. Don't go! Not my mailbox!
|-
!Nate
|''(Punches Thompson's mailbox and recoils)'' Ugh. Ow!
|-
!Thompson
|''(Growls; to the twins:)'' What did you just do? I've let these guys pick on me for years to keep this group together. And now they've totally fallen apart.
|-
!Dipper
|But we were all starting to finally hang out together. I was one of the gang.
|-
!Thompson
|Well, unless you can break up Robbie and Tambry immediately, there is no gang. I have no more friends and neither do you. ''(Peeling off duck tape sticking a chip to his shirt)'' I'm gonna to eat this. ''(Leaves)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, what did I tell you about staying out of Robbie's personal life?
|-
!Mabel
|I know, I know. I just wanted to be a good matchmaker. I never should have gotten that love potion from the Love God.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, love potion? If you did a spell, then can't you, like, undo it?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' That's it! If I undo the spell then everyone will be friends again! But I'm gonna need your help. Also, you are not pulling off that v-neck.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Dejectedly:)'' I know.
|-
!Mabel
|Burn it!
|-
!
|''Cut to Woodstick Festival.''
|-
!Man in hot air balloon
|Whoa! Ha ha!
|-
!
|''Pan through various festival activities and then to Stan and Soos, who is sewing.''
|-
!Stan
|Balloon faster, Soos. We need this thing up in the air before the festival ends.
|-
!Soos
|Are you sure that that open flame should be that close to that dangling cloth and rope?
|-
!Stan
|I'm sure about everything. Now lube up those engine gears with some kerosene! More kerosene!
|-
!
|''Cut to the Woodstick Festival entrance. Mabel and Dipper peek out from behind two trash cans trash bins. Thompson walks by, pulling Wendy, Nate and Lee towards the entrance.''
|-
!Thompson
|Uh! Come back, guys! Come on. The tickets were a hundred bucks. I sold my watch. You gotta come to the concert.
|-
!Wendy
|Ew, and have to look at that? No, thanks.
|-
!
|''Robbie and Tambry are seen walking together, arms linked.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' Ugh, they're doing that couple hug walk. ''(To Tambry and Robbie:)'' Guys you're in public! People can see you!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Whispering:)'' Dipper, come on. ''(They sneak past the guards and hide near [[Love God's van]].)''
|-
!Man
|Love God. Sound check for Love God.
|-
!Love God
|''(The van's trunk opens and Love God falls out) ''Ow. Let's make some miracles happen. Groupies, bed-head me.'' (Chuckles)'' Love God's about to get crazy. ''(Walks away with his groupies)'' Whoa, hey, alright.
|-
!Mabel
|Now's our chance.
|-
!
|''The twins run to the open trunk of the van, where Love God left his belt of love potions.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Mabel grabs the belt and looks at the love potions, which are all labeled)'' Here we go. ''(Reading the labels:)'' Let's see. "Puppy-love." "Interspecies love." "Love of country music." Ew. Oh! "Anti-love!" "To reverse the effects of love potion simply spray on your victim and watch their heart die on the inside."
|-
!Dipper
|Sounds good to me. ''(They turn to leave but Love God is standing in front of them)''
|-
!Love God
|Hey! You're the one who's been stealing my stuff. I am ''not'' loving this.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm sorry, but I made a mistake and I have to fix it.
|-
!Love God
|Kid, I tried to tell you. This stuff is way too dangerous. On my oath as a god I cannot let you—oh hey, where'd you just go?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Running away with Dipper)'' I'm sorry Love God! But it's for the good of my friends.
|-
!Love God
|''(Chasing after them)'' Come back here!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Seeing Love God about to get to her, she throws the anti-love potion)'' Dipper catch!
|-
!
|''Dipper catches the potion and runs on stage, where The Handlebar Brothers are performing, followed by Mabel and Love God.''
|-
!Love God
|''(To the Handlebar Brothers:)'' Get those kids!
|-
!The Handlebar Bros.
|''(Standing in front of Dipper and Mabel)'' Halt! We mustache you to move. ''(The twins karate chop their mustaches, causing the brothers to butt heads and fall to the ground)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' Good one. ''(They dive into the audience and start crowd surfing)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To a crowd member)'' Ooh! Thank you.
|-
!Dipper
|Agh! No, no, no. Everyone is touching everything!
|-
!Love God
|''(Doing breaststrokes as he crowd surfs)'' Give me back that potion. ''(To a crowd member, high fiving them:)'' Oh, hey, what's up? ''(To another crowd member, handing them a cassette:)'' Here, have a cassette. ''(The crowd surf ends and he lands on the ground as the twins run away)'' Dang it. ''(Flutters wings)'' Fly, tiny wings! Get up there! ''(Starts flying)'' Oh. I haven't had to use these in a ''long'' time.
|-
!
|''Love God continues to chase the twins. They past through a booth with Sprott drinking cider. When Sprott sees them, he pours half of his cider to the ground.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, look. ''(Sees Robbie and Tambry. Grabs cap of spray bottle and puts it on top of potion bottle)'' Just one clean shot to the back of their heads and everything's fixed.
|-
!Love God
|Sorry, kids, but you've left me no choice. Visions of heartbreak past! ''(Summons a pink smoke which reveals illusions of Mabel's past crushes)''
|-
![[Gabe Bensen|Gabe]]
|We're back Mabel.
|-
![[Sev'ral Timez]]
|''(Singing:)'' We like you now.
|-
!Boy from "[[Tourist Trapped]]"
|Yes. Definitely. Absolutely!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Punches illusion of boy)'' Ugh. Ha! You really think we'd fall for that? ''(Looks at Mabel, who is surrounded by the remaining illusions)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Giggles)'' Sure you can all marry me. Oh, guy from the $10 bill, I forgot I had a crush on you.
|-
!Dipper
|Dang it, Mabel. They're not real.
|-
![[Mermando]]
|Just give us the bottle, Mabel.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel don't!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan and Soos. Soos is still fixing up the balloon and Stan is staring at the blueprints.''
|-
!Stan
|It's finally done. When these idiots see this balloon, they'll understand that I love young people. ''(Shot of blueprints showing a [[Stan balloon|hot air balloon that looks like Stan]] and has "I HEART KIDS" written on it) "I heart kids." All right. Let 'er rip.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Soos lets the balloon go and takes a step back)'' Oh no! A letter ''rip!'' ''(Dives out of the way)''
|-
!Stan
|What the H?! ''(Gets crushed by the letter "H" from the balloon and the letter "R" hits the ground immediately after)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the crowd. The Stan balloon looms overhead, now reading "I EAT KIDS." People begin shouting and screaming.''
|-
!Teen 1
|I eat kids? But we're kids!
|-
!Teen 2
|It's heaven's punishment for our terrible taste in everything!
|-
!
|''The balloon begins to malfunction, sets fire and plummets towards a young boy and his mother who are sitting on a picnic blanket.''
|-
![[Charlie (kid)|Charlie]]
|Mommy, is the floating head going to eat us?
|-
![[Charlie's mother]]
|''(Holding him close and silently crying)'' Yes, Charlie. Yes he will.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Mabel, who is surrounded by visions of heartbreak past.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(As Mabel hands the potion to "Mermando")'' Mabel it's a trick. Don't give him the—
|-
!Love God
|''(Taking the bottle from "Mermando") ''Gotcha! ''(The illusions disappear)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ugh! Curse my over-sized heart.
|-
!Love God
|Sorry, kids, but that's what happens when you mess with a god. Only a greater being from the heavens themselves could possibly stop—''(Crowd screaming as the Stan balloon approaches)''
|-
!Man
|It's coming down!
|-
!Love God
|Whoa!
|-
!
|''The balloon lands on Love God, causing him to drop the potion. A crowd gathers around the balloon as a man hoses it off. Mr. and Mrs. Valentino are watching from a distance.''
|-
!Mr. Valentino
|Oh, no. I hope someone didn't die.
|-
!Mrs. Valentino
|Yes, that would be awful. ''(Both laugh)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos and Stan''
|-
!Stan
|What's everybody crying about? In my day zeppelins fell from the sky like raindrops.
|-
!Teen 2
|It's him! The horrible old man from the sky! ''(People shrieking)''
|-
!Stan
|You know what? Being loved by the youth is overrated. Being feared, now that's priceless. ''(They walk away from the balloon wreckage, where Dipper and Mabel are standing)''
|-
!Dipper
|Love God? Are you okay?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Fingers crossed; whispering:)'' Please be immortal. Please be immortal.
|-
!Love God
|''(Gasps as he crawls out from under the wreckage)'' Dude. I am so over this.
|-
!Announcer
|''(Offscreen; over a mic:)'' Love God to the stage. Love God to the stage.
|-
!Love God
|Agh, look kid. Take it, okay. Spray everyone for all I care. You wanna mess with peoples' lives? You wanna play god? Do it. 'Cus I'm sick of it. ''(Walking away)'' Medic! I need onion rings...
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Dipper hiding behind a bush that Robbie and Tambry are sitting in front of.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, Mabel. Now's our chance. They break up and the whole friend group gets back together.
|-
!
|''As Mabel is pointing the potion towards Robbie and Tambry reluctantly, Robbie turns around and sees Mabel. Dipper hides as Mabel hides the potion behind her.''
|-
!Robbie
|Mabel! Mabel, I just wanted to thank you. I've been so miserable since Wendy broke up with me that I thought my life was over, but you were right. I just needed to move on. I'm... happy ? Weird, huh?
|-
!Tambry
|''(Offscreen:)'' Robbie, people are commenting on our picture. ''(Robbie winks at Mabel and walks away)''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, maybe we shouldn't do this. I mean, every time we play with peoples' fates it's only made things worse. ''(They look at Robbie and Tambry, who are painting each others eyes with eye paint)''
|-
!Dipper
|They ''are'' kinda perfect for each other in a gross kinda way. But what about our friend group?
|-
!Mabel
|Well, maybe it'll sort itself out. I mean, there's gotta be something that could bring everyone back together.
|-
!
|''Cut to Thompson, who is wearing a jacket and hat to cover the snacks he is hiding and is holding a cake.''
|-
!Thompson
|Guys, I made a friendship cake. So let's all get over this, okay? ''(Gets hit in the head with a beach ball, dropping the cake)'' Ugh! My cake! ''(Bends down to pick it up the cake but his coat rips revealing the hidden snacks)''
|-
!Security Guard 1
|Hey! Food from the outside! ''(They chase after Thompson, who screams and runs)''
|-
!Security Guard 2
|Get him!
|-
!
|''Cut to the rest of the gang.''
|-
!Lee
|Whoa! Hey, look!
|-
!Wendy
|Is that Thompson?
|-
!
|''Briefly cut to Thompson, who is hugging onto a utility pole. Security guard 2 blows a whistle as Security guard 1 beats Thompson with a broom. Thompson grunts as he is struck. Whistle blowing and Thompson grunting. Back to the group. All laughing.''
|-
!Nate
|Yeah, fight the machine Thompson!
|-
!Wendy
|Throw snacks at 'em!
|-
!Robbie
|Use jerky as a weapon!
|-
!Nate
|Thompson!
|-
!All but Dipper & Mabel
|''(Chanting continuously)'' Thompson!
|-
!
|''A broom is swung at him and he cries out as he falls off, grabbing a rope and dangling down as the two security guards beat him like a piñata with a broom and a large stick. The gang continues to cheer him on (with the exception of Dipper, Mabel and Robbie). Cut to Nate and Lee. Lee stops chanting and then Nate does. Lee playfully punches Nate's shoulder and Nate does the same. Cut to Tambry and Wendy, with Lee and Nate now cheering again. Tambry stops cheering and smiles apologetically at Wendy. Wendy stops and does the same. Robbie smiles at Wendy and she smiles back apologetically.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Dipper:)'' I think every just might be all right.
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe someone up there really ''is'' a genius matchmaker.
|-
!
|''Cut to Thompson who is on the top of the utility pole, smiling at his friends.''
|-
!Thompson
|All according to plan. ''(He's hit again and his friends continue to cheer as the guards beat him senselessly)''
|-
!
|''Cut to credits. "[[Goat and a Pig]]" plays as various pictures of Gompers and Waddles wedding and life as a couple are shown.''
|-
!(Singing)
|A goat and a pig. A couple of livestock living their lives stuck together in harmony. A pig and a goat, showing the world that a pig and a goat can be family. Love's so strong, love's so big. Such a beautiful goat and a pig. Bound in matrimony now and forever. Shopping for groceries and buying a condo and filing their taxes together. Goat and a pig, goat and a pig.

|''Episode opens with a shot of [[Northwest Manor]] in a thunder storm. Cut to manor interior, closeup of [[Priscilla Northwest]] reading a paper.''
|-
!Priscilla Northwest
|[[Preston Northwest|Preston]], I must say, the guest list for this year's [[Northwest Fest|party]] has so much diversity!
|-
!Preston
Northwest
|Yes, a nice mix of millionaires ''and'' billionaires. ''(Swats servant with a newspaper)'' Put the oyster fork at an angle! We're not animals, man.
|-
!Priscilla
|Now where the devil is—? ''(Turns to doorway, sees [[Pacifica Northwest|Pacifica]] in a lake foam green dress)'' Pacifica! ''(Pacifica curtsies, she walks up to her)'' What did I tell you about that dress? The theme is ''sea foam green'', not lake foam green! Go change!
|-
!Pacifica
Northwest
|But, I- I kinda like it.
|-
!Preston
|Mind your mother, Pacifica.
|-
!Pacifica
|But-- ''(Preston rings a bell.)'' Yes, father.
|-
!
|''The ground begins to shake, while at the table, plates and utensils clatter. The Northwests and their staff stare and gasp.''
|-
!Preston
|Oh no! It's... ''happening''.
|-
!
|''Furniture and dinnerware fly at the unfortunate individuals present, while everyone either ducks or hides underneath tables.''
|-
!Preston
|You are my possessions! ''(Swats a plate away)'' Obey me!

|''More things fly at Preston. He screams and ducks underneath the table.''
|-
!Priscilla
|This is a disaster! The party's in just 24 hours!
|-
!Preston
|Surely there's someone who can handle this sort of nonsense!

|Be strong, bladder. ''(Pats stomach.)'' We're not gonna move till sunset.

|-
!Toby
|Well tonight's the night, but I've been out here for days! ''(Zoom out to reveal tattered and filthy Toby.)'' The Northwest family's annual high-society-shindig-ball-soiree is here! And even though common folk aren't let in, that doesn't stop us from camping out for a peek at the fanciness!
|-
!Girls
|Oooooooooh!
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, can someone ''please'' explain why people care about this?
|-
!Grenda
|It's pretty much the best party of all time. Rich food, richer boys!
|-
!Mabel
|They say each gift basket has a live quail inside!
|-
!Candy
|''(Paws at TV screen)'' Give me your life, Pacifica.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Scoffs)'' Guys, in case you've already forgotten, Pacifica Northwest is the ''worst''. ''(Knock at door; Dipper gets up to answer it.)'' And that's not just jealousy talking. I'd say that to her face. ''(Opens door, sees Pacifica.)''
|-
!Pacifica
|I need your help.
|-
!Dipper
|You're the worst. ''(Slams door.)''
|-
!Girls
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Dipper
|See? ''(Knock at door; Dipper opens it reluctantly.)''
|-
!Pacifica
|Look. You think it's easy for me to come here? I don't want to be seen in this hovel. But there's something haunting Northwest Manor. ''(Takes off sunglasses.)'' If you don't help me, the party could be ruined!
|-
!Dipper
|And why should I trust you? All you've ever done is try to humiliate me and Mabel.
|-
!Pacifica
|Just name your price, okay? I'll give you anything!
|-
!Mabel
|Hi, Pacifica! Excuse us! ''(Drags Dipper away by the arm.)'' Dipper! Don't you see what this means? If you help Pacifica, you could get us invites to the greatest party of all time!
|-
!Dipper
|What? Mabel, this is ''Pacifica'' we're talking about!
|-
!Mabel
|But it's Candy and Grenda's dream!
|-
!Candy & Grenda
|''(Starry-eyed, miming rainbows.)'' Dreeeaaaaaaam.
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh. Fine! I'll bust your ghost. But, in exchange, I'll need three tickets to the party.

|Hrrn! You're just lucky I'm desperate.

|''Cut to exterior shot of Northwest Manor. A [[Northwest's family car|limo]] drives through the crowds as a [[Unnamed Northwest butler|butler]] pulls a lever to open the main gates and let it through.

|Welcome to Northwest Manor, dorks. Try not to touch anything.

|Ah, if it isn't the man of the hour! Hopefully you can help us with our little... situation, before the guests arrive in an hour.

|Splendid! Pacifica, take our guest to the "problem room," and, uh... he's not wearing ''that,'' is he?

!Dipper
|Ugh, it's like this collar is strangling me. Who do you guys think you're impressing with this stuff?
|-
!Pacifica
|Um, everyone. ''(Ties Dipper's bow tie.)'' ''You'' wouldn't understand. High standards are what make the Northwest family great.
|-
!Dipper
|Funny, I thought it was [[Northwest Cover-up|lying about founding the town]]. ''(Fiddles with a picture frame's tassel.)''

!Candy
|[[Marius von Fundshauser]]! He's a baron from Austria!
|-
!Mabel
|Forget the quail, I'm putting ''him'' in my guest basket!
|-
!Grenda
|Hold up, ladies. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think this boy is out of our league.
|-
!Candy
|Grenda is right. He's a white whale. Hunting him will destroy us.
|-
!Mabel
|There are ''tons'' of cute boys coming. Let's swear a sisters' truce not to waste time on Marius. ''(All place hands together.)''

|-
!Pacifica
|This is the main room where it's been happening.
|-
!Dipper
|Yep, this looks like the kind of room that would be haunted, all right. I wouldn't worry about it, though. ''(holds up the [[Journal 3|journal]])'' [[Ghosts]] fall on a ten-category scale. Floating plates sound like a Category 1.
|-
!Pacifica
|So what? Are you gonna bore him back into the afterlife by reading from this book?
|-
!Dipper
|Just gotta splash this sucker with some anointed water ''(Holds up small, round bottle of water)'', and he should be out of your probably-fake blonde hair.
|-
!Pacifica
|What was that about my hair?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes out [[wikipedia:EMF detector|EMF detector]])'' Shh! I'm picking something up.

!
|''Dipper walks further into the room, stopping before a tall painting of a lumberjack over the fireplace. The device loses its signal for a moment.''
|-
!Dipper
|C'mon, stupid thing. ''(Taps device, and the signal returns)'' There we go.
|-
!
|''Dipper looks back at the painting, and the lumberjack inside has disappeared.''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, Pacifica?
|-
!Pacifica
|Aah! ''(Screams as blood dripping from above, gasps, looks up)''
|-
!
|''Blood swells from the mouths of the stuffed animal heads on the walls. Dipper and Pacifica shout as the fire bursts out of the fireplace.''

|I smell... A NORTHWEST! ''(Ax materializes in his hand, begins dragging ax along the floor)'' Come out, come out, wherever you are!

|-
!Dipper
|''(Whispering:)'' I'm looking! And it's not dumb, okay? This book is gonna save our lives! Alright, here we go. Advice: ''(Holds [[Dipper's black light|portable black light]] over book, which reads "PRAY FOR MERCY!")'' Aww, seriously?!

!Candy
|Yes yes, a truce! Uh, Grenda? Can you go fetch us some fancy napkins?
|-
!Grenda
|Wow, okay!
|-
!Candy
|Listen, Mabel, I don't know if I can follow this truce! He is too adorable!
|-
!Mabel
|Huh, me too, Candy. But what do we do? He's unattainable!
|-
!Candy
|What if we flirt with him as a team? With our cuteness combined, one of us might have a chance!
|-
!Mabel
|It is the perfect plan, but what about Grenda?
|-
!Candy
|I love Grenda, Mabel. But these boys are fancy! Her aggressive flirting style might scare them away!
|-
!
|''Shot of Grenda pointing at a boy's jacket.''

!Pacifica
|Hurry! Through the garden! Watch out for peacocks!
|-
!
|''Dipper, head in journal, hits a peacock as they go. Dipper and Pacifica muddy their shoes on the garden path as they run.''
|-
!Dipper
|Come on, come on-- ''(Flips through journal desperately)'' I got it! Haunted paintings can only be trapped in a silver mirror. ''(Points ahead of them)'' Look! There's a silver mirror right there!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Pacifica run towards a pristine white room, where a large, rectangular mirror hangs on the rear wall. Pacifica grabs his arm, stopping him before he can enter.''
|-
!Pacifica
|Wait! Don't go in there! This room has my parents' favorite carpet pattern! They'll lose it if we track mud in there!
|-
!Dipper
|What? Are you serious?! ''(Tries to force his way into the room, but Pacifica holds him back)''
|-
!Pacifica
|We'll find another way!
|-
!Ghost
|''(From a distance)'' Come out! ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|Pacifica, we don't have time for this! Let me through!
|-
!Pacifica
|No, my parents will kill me!
|-
!Dipper
|Why are you so afraid of your parents?!
|-
!Pacifica
|You wouldn't understand!
|-
!
|''Pacifica tugs on Dipper's journal, tripping them both and causing them to fall through a painting of a skeleton in a crown and robe into a dark, dusty, cobwebbed room. The ghost flies past in the opposite direction.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ahh... What is this place?
|-
!Pacifica
|That's weird. I don't even know where this room is.
|-
!Dipper
|Hopefully the ghost doesn't either.
|-
!Pacifica
|Yeah, maybe we're safe. ''(A sheet behind her seems to come alive, reaching out to swallow her)''
|-
!Dipper
|Pacifica, watch out!
|-
!Pacifica
|Aaaaah!
|-
!Ghost
|YOUR FATE IS SEALED! ''(Pursues Pacifica, knocking over a box of silver dishes, utensils and other objects)''
|-
!Dipper
|A silver mirror!
|-
!Pacifica

|-
!Ghost
|PREPARE TO DIE, NORTHWEST! ''(Raises ax and charges Pacifica)''
|-
!
|''Dipper dashes in front of Pacifica, holding the silver mirror. Dipper and Pacifica are knocked out of a first floor window, become entangled in a window drape and fall down a short hill.''
|-
!Pacifica
|Did you get him? ''(They look at the mirror, still held by Dipper)''
|-
!Ghost
|''(From inside the mirror:) ''NO! FREE ME! ''(Pounds on mirror's interior)''
|-
!Dipper & Pacifica
|Haha! Yes!
|-
!Pacifica
|We did it! ''(Hugs Dipper. Eyes widen when she realizes what she's doing, and then she backs off awkwardly. She clears her throat and holds out a dollar, avoiding eye-contact with Dipper)'' Can I ''pay'' you to pretend that never happened?
|-
!
|''Cut to Northwest Manor garden, where Preston and Priscilla Northwest are meeting Dipper, while Pacifica and a waiter stand nearby.''
|-
!Preston
|Well, Pacifica, you really found the right man for the job. ''(Snaps fingers, butler shakes Dipper's hand)''
|-
!Priscilla
|We can't thank you enough. ''(Pauses)'' That's enough. ''(Butler stops shaking Dipper's hand)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, just holding up my end of the deal. ''(Turns to leave)''
|-
!Pacifica
|Wait, leaving already? You're at the world's best party, dummy.
|-
!Dipper
|Heh, I'd love to stay, but I've got a Category 10 ghost to dispose of. ''(Walks into a garden pillar)'' Aah! Heh heh... Category 10. ''(Both laugh as Dipper leaves)''
|-
!
|''Cut to outer garden as Dipper walks away.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To self:)'' Call me crazy, but, maybe she's not that bad after all.
|-
!Ghost
|''(Laughs from mirror)''
|-
!Dipper
|What are you laughing about, man? I defeated you.
|-
!Ghost
|You've been had, boy. You remind me of me a hundred and fifty years ago.
|-
!Dipper
|What do you mean?
|-
!Ghost
|''(Flashback montage; Voiceover:)'' One hundred and fifty years ago this day, the Northwests asked us lumber-folk to build them a mansion atop the hill. We were told t'would be a service to the [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|town]], that once a year they would throw a grand party, and all would share in the bounty. It took years of backbreaking labor and sacrifice, but when it was time for the grand party they promised the common folk of the town, they refused to let us in.
|-
!Flashback Lumberjack
|''(As he pounds on mansion gate) ''YOU PROMISED, NORTHWEST!
|-
!Ghost
|''(Voiceover:)'' With the trees gone, the mudslides began. While they partied and laughed, I was swept away by the storm! ''(Offscreen, a swept-up ax embeds itself in the lumberjack's head)'' And so I said with final breath, "One-fifty years I'll return from death, and if the gate's still closed to town, wealthy blood will stain the ground!" A curse passed down until this day. ''(Shot of [[Nathaniel Northwest|Northwest ancestor]] writing down curse and holding it in hand, then transitions to Preston, curse warning in hand, nodding to Pacifica)''
|-
!Dipper
|So, wait a minute. The Northwests ''knew'' this haunting was coming, and they tricked me into helping them to avoid ghostly justice? ... I'll be right back.
|-
!
|''Cut to manor interior.''
|-
!Preston
|Thank you so much for coming, Mayor. As a sign of our respect, please take this chimp servant. Keep him away from bright lights, he gets... grabby.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Offscreen)'' Northwests! ''(Mansion main door opens, revealing Dipper pointing at Preston accusingly)'' You've got some explaining to do!
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Dashes in from another room)'' Dipper, you came back!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Points at Pacifica)'' You lied to me! All of you did! All you had to do was let the townsfolk into the party and you could've broken the curse! But you made me do your dirty work instead!
|-
!Preston
|''(Leans down threateningly; Dipper glares at him, unfazed)'' Look at who you're talking to, boy. I'm hosting a party for the most powerful people in the world. You think they'd come here if they had to rub elbows with ''your'' kind?
|-
!Dipper
|"''My'' kind?" ''(Looks at Pacifica)'' I was right about you all along. You're just as bad as your parents. Another link in the world's worst chain!
|-
!Pacifica
|I'm sorry, they made me! I should've told you, but-- ''(Preston rings the bell. Blushing, Pacifica steps back)''
|-
!Preston
|Enjoy the party! It's the last time you and your kind will ever come. ''(Dipper glares and marches away, chimp servant offers him a tray)'' No no! Those aren't for him.
|-
!
|''Cut to mansion exterior, where Dipper is about to exorcise the ghost.''
|-
!Dipper
|Stupid Northwests, making me do their exorcism for them. "Exodus demonus, spookus scarus, aintafraidus noghostus--"
|-
!Ghost
|''(From mirror:)'' Dipper, Dipper! Please let me get my vengeance on the Northwests! You hate them as much as I.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, I feel you. It's just, my sister's in there, and you seem a ''little'' unstable, man.
|-
!Ghost
|Very well, boy. Then... before you banish my soul, may these tired lumber eyes gaze upon the trees one final time?
|-
!Dipper
|Uh... I guess. ''(Holds mirror up to the forest)'' Go nuts, man.
|-
!
|''The ghost cackles madly and the mirror becomes red-hot. Dipper drops it as it burns his hand, and it shatters on the ground, releasing the ghost back to the mansion.''
|-
!Dipper
|Aah!
|-
!Ghost
|Yes! VENGEANCE!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no! Mabel!
|-
!
|''Cut to manor interior, main ballroom.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Marius:)'' Hi! I'm Mabel. So, Australia, huh? Do you guys eat kangaroo meat over there, or... are they... strictly pets?
|-
!Marius
|I am from Austria.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs nervously; taps Candy's shoulder)'' Tag! Tag!
|-
!Candy
|I am Candy! I love the tiny hats you wear on your shoulders.
|-
!Mabel
|Hi! If you were a boat, do you know what kind you'd be? A dream boat. That's what kind.
|-
!Candy
|''(Elbows Mabel)'' You are tagged out!
|-
!Mabel
|I tagged back in!
|-
!Candy
|You can't do that!
|-
!Mabel
|I can tag myself! It's allowed!
|-
!Candy
|No, no! ''(Unintelligible arguing)''
|-
!
|''Marius nervously walks away as the two girls continue to argue.''
|-
!Grenda
|AHEM! What exactly was all that? You were flirting with Marius without me!
|-
!Candy
|We are sorry, Grenda, it's just...
|-
!Mabel
|Your flirting style can come off as a bit... intense...
|-
!Grenda
|''(Blushing)'' Oh, I see! You think I shouldn't be myself just because I'm in this stupid mansion! I thought you liked my style!
|-
!Candy
|We do! But these boys might not!
|-
!Grenda
|Oh, then I guess they wouldn't like this, either! Hey, Marius!
|-
!Marius
|Ja?
|-
!Grenda
|You've got something... on your shirt!
|-
!
|''Marius looks down at his shirt, and Grenda smacks his nose. Marius shouts, Mabel and Candy gasp angrily. All three girls walk away in different directions. Marius glances after Grenda, starry-eyed.''
|-
!
|''Cut to Preston, ringing a glass.''
|-
!Preston
|Thank you all for coming! I think we can all say this party was a rousing success.
|-
!Sportsman
|I guess you could say it was a slam dunk, Presto.
|-
!Preston
|''(Unenthusiastic:) ''Yes, yes, I guess, sure. ''(Happily:) ''A toast! To our family name-- ''(Glasses shatter, sound of laughter)'' What?!

|-
!Mayor
|Ah, the grim reaper! I'd been wondering when you would arri-- Aaah! ''(Beam hits mayor, turns mayor and wheelchair to wood. He falls over)''
|-
!
|''Guests begin running and screaming in every direction. The ghost fires the beam at everyone he can see. Dead taxidermy animals come alive and advance on the guests.''
|-
!Priscilla
|Preston, what are we going to do?
|-
!Preston
|Prepare the panic room. ''(Punches stuffed squirrel off of his shoulder)''
|-
!
|''The front doors fly open with a flash of lightning and thunder, revealing Dipper, soaking from the rain, agape in shock at what he sees. One of the guests reaches out towards him.''
|-
!Terrified Guest
|Please, help me! ''(Freezes, wooden)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Jumps back) ''Whoa, that is messed up!

|A Northwest? ...Pacifica!

!
|''Cut to hallway with secret room.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Running to Pacifica) ''Pacifica! There you are! The ghost is turning everyone to wood, and he just started rhyming, for some reason? ''(Tugs Pacifica's hand)'' I need your help! ''(Pacifica pulls her hand away)'' Pacifica?
|-
!Pacifica
|You wanna know why this room was locked up? This is what I found in here. A painted record of every horrible thing that my family's ever done. Lying, cheating, and then there's me. I lied to you just because I'm too scared to talk back to my stupid parents! ''(Takes off diamond earrings and throws them at a painting of Preston and Priscilla Northwest)'' You were right about me. I ''am'' just another link in the world's worst chain.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' Pacifica, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. But just because you're your parents' daughter doesn't mean you have to be like them. It's not too late.
|-
!Ghost
|''(Offscreen)'' IT'S TOO LATE!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no! ''(They run into the main hall)''
|-
!Ghost
|You are all wood!

!Pacifica
|Dipper, wait!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks up a silver platter)'' Alright ghost, prepare to get-- ''(Energy beam knocks the journal out of Dipper's hand, and he drops the platter)'' ah! No, wait! ''(Ghost fires a burst that hits Dipper)'' No no no! No, someone help! SOMEONE HEEEELLLLP...! ''(Dipper freezes in [[Into the Bunker|a familiar form]])''

|-
!Ghost
|A FOREST OF DEATH, A LESSON LEARNED, AND NOW THE NORTHWEST MANOR WILL BURN! ''(Laughs as the manor sets fire)''
|-
!Pacifica
|Hey, ugly! Over here! You want me to let in the townsfolk? 'Cause I'll do it! Just change everyone back!
|-
!Ghost
|YOU WISH TO PROVE YOURSELF? PULL THAT LEVER AND OPEN THE GRAND GATE TO THE TOWN! FULFILL YOUR ANCESTORS' PROMISE!
|-
!Preston
|''(Coming out of an underground hatch with Priscilla Northwest and a butler)'' Pacifica Elise Northwest! Stop this instant! We can't let the town see us like this! We have a reputation to uphold! Now come into the panic room. There's enough mini-sandwiches and oxygen to last you, me, and a butler a full week. ''(Whispers:)'' We'll eat the butler!
|-
!
|''Pacifica looks at Dipper's wooden statue, and reaches for the lever.''
|-
!Preston
|You dare to disobey us? ''(Rings bell; Pacifica nervously reaches for the lever as he continues to ring it.)'' Dingally dingally! Is this bell broken?!

!Pacifica
|''(Stomps foot, determined.)'' Our family name is broken! And I'm gonna fix it! ''(Pulls the lever.)''

|Pacifica, you are not like the other Northwests. I feel... lumber justice. ''(Fades to nothing, the ax in his head falling to the floor and sinking into the ground)''
|-
!
|''There is a rumbling noise, and the doors of the manor burst open as the people of Gravity Falls enter the party.''
|-
![[Manly Dan]]
|Aw, yes! Yeah! ''(Jumps into cider fountain)''
|-
!Preston
|Good lord, the riffraff! They're everywhere! ''(Tyler giggles, picking up a fork and placing it down again)'' That's not how the fork should be placed!
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, man, what happened?
|-
!Grenda
|Ahem!
|-
!Candy
|Grenda! We are so sorry.
|-
!Mabel
|We shouldn't have left you behind.
|-
!Grenda
|It's okay. Maybe I do need to work on my flirting. Come on, let's go dunk our heads in some cheese and chocolate. Friends?
|-
!Mabel & Candy
|Friends! ''(Group hug.)''
|-
!Marius
|Wait! Don't go! Grenda, was it? I must speak with you. There is something about you, I can't get you out of my head. You're so bold and confident. I know you are probably out of my league, but, might I give you mein phone number?
|-
!Grenda
|I don't have a phone! Write it on my ''face!''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa-ho-ho! Go Grenda!
|-
!Candy
|I guess we shouldn't have sold her short. I call bridesmaid!
|-
!Mabel
|What? I call co-bridesmaid!
|-
!Dipper
|Man, if your family hates you for this, they're idiots. This is great.
|-
!Pacifica
|Enjoy it while it lasts. Next year I'm sure they're just gonna lock everyone out again.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey. Guess what we're standing on.
|-
!
|''Pacifica gasps, seeing her parents' favorite white carpet pattern. Then she laughs, and she and Dipper have some fun knocking things onto the carpet.''
|-
!Pacifica
|Haha. But seriously, I'd better go and find someone to clean this up. ''(Walks away.)''
|-
![[Old Man McGucket|McGucket]]
|Woo! Scobbity-doo! Hornswaggle m' goat knees!
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa-ho-ho, what's up, McGucket? Hey-- ''(McGucket grabs Dipper by the shoulders and they dash around a corner to speak in private.)''
|-
!McGucket
|Dipper! I've been lookin' for ya. I fixed the [[laptop]]. I been doin' calculations, and I think something terrible is comin'! The apocalypse! The End Times!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pinches the bridge of his nose, sighing.)'' You know what, McGucket? How about we talk about this stuff tomorrow? It's a party. Let's have some fun for once, huh? ''(Walks off, smiling)''
|-
!McGucket
|But--!
|-
!
|''McGucket plucks the laptop from his beard and opens it. The screen reads "IMMINENT THREAT" with what appears to be a countdown, showing less than twenty-four hours until the portal activates''.
|-
!McGucket
|Oh, this is bad! Something's coming! Something big!
|-
!
|''The camera pans to just above McGucket, where a tapestry depicts a triangle eye which looks similar to [[Bill Cipher]] in the sky above a burning landscape and cowering figures. Below the worshippers are skulls and bones lying on the ground.''
|-
!
|''Cut to credits. In a coat closet within the manor.''
|-
![[Agent Powers]]
|''(Disguised; in a fake accent:)'' Quick, in here, my darling! ''(Pulls disguised [[Agent Trigger]] into the room after him.)''
|-
!Agent Trrigger
|''(High pitched voice:)'' A moment alone at last!
|-
!Powers
|You can drop the act, Trigger. ''(Both remove disguises.)'' They're seeing activity on the machine. It's go time.
|-
!Trigger
|Roger that. ''(Salutes.)''
|-
!Powers
|Where's my phone?
|-
!Trigger
|I don't have it.
|-
!Powers
|Yes you do, it was in your purse.
|-
!Trigger
|Oh, so I'm just supposed to hold on to everything for you?
|-
!Powers
|I asked you when we were in the car!
|-
!Trigger
|Why do we always have to fight at parties?!
|-
![[Tambry]]
|''(Opens door; pauses)'' Not even gonna ask. ''(Shuts door)''

|The ''Episode begins with an establishing shot of [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]], late at night. A blue pulsing light glows. Then, a shot of the [[vending machine]] inside [[Mystery Shack|the Shack]], which is also periodically back-lit by the pulsing blue light. Cut to [[Stan Pines]] in the [[underground laboratory]] beneath the Shack, working on the [[universe portal]]. Stan pulls a lever, and green fluid pumps into large, glass tanks.''
|-
!Stan
|Come on, come on. Should be just enough to finish the job. ''(Removes his fez and glove, and without knowing, wipes toxic waste on his forehead, which sizzles and briefly glows green)'' Whew. Can't be too careful with this stuff.
|-
!
|''Red lights flash and a buzzer goes off. Stan smiles and turns to look at screen. The screen reads "EVENT INITIALIZED" and an eighteen hour countdown begins.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Reading from [[Journal 1]]:)'' "Warning," blah blah blah, "Extreme usage could result in minor gravity anomalies." Can it, Poindexter! ''(Slams journal shut)'' I've come this far. I'm not givin' up now! ''(Pushes a button, and the portal begins to spin)'' Yes, this is it.
|-
!
|''Stan's fez floats off of his head. Outside the Shack, rocks float off the ground, along with [[Gompers]] the goat. A boat lifts out of [[Lake Gravity Falls|the lake]]. In the [[Gravity Falls Junkyard|scrapyard]], broken-down cars and junk lift off the ground, and inside [[Old Man McGucket|McGucket]]'s makeshift shack, a blue light blinks, illuminating the sleeping and floating McGucket and the functioning [[laptop]] which now reads "ACTIVE" under an image of the portal. Back in the Shack, [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], as well as [[Waddles]], float off their beds, but sleep undisturbed. There is a resounding "thunk" as everything in town touches back down to the ground.''
|-
!Stan
|It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but it'll all be worth it. ''(Synchronizes what looks like a large wristwatch with the steadily ticking countdown, still displayed on the monitor)'' Just eighteen more hours. Finally, everything changes. Today.
|-
!
|''A draft blows the journal shut.''
|-
!
|''Cut to shortened [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Cut to Mabel, running down the halls, followed by a tired Dipper.''
|-
!Mable
|''(Running down hall)'' Ahh! It's here it's here it's here!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Dipper:)'' Okay, so I was just opening random doors - because I'm a creep - when I found something amazing!
|-
!Dipper
|''(While rubbing his eyes)'' If it was worth waking up at seven AM for, that ''will'' be amazing.
|-
!Mabel
|Feast your eyes! ''(Opening door to reveal closet filled with various types of fireworks in a box labeled "DO NOT TOUCH!")''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Puts hand on Dipper's shoulder)'' Bro. Bro. We're both thinking it.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Crazy rooftop fireworks party!
|-
!Stan
|''(Marches up to them)'' Not so fast, kids! There is no way on earth you're setting off those dangerous, illegal fireworks... ''(Smiles and bends down to put his arms around their shoulders)'' ...without me.
|-
!
|''Cut to roof. Dipper is grabbing a icy-pop from the cooler. Mabel is standing excitedly next to Stan, who is sitting on the lounge chair with a lit [[wikipedia:Sparkler|sparkler]] and [[wikipedia:Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]].''
|-
!Stan
|Here you go, sweetie. ''(Lights Mabel's [[wikipedia:skyrocket (firework)|skyrocket]] with a sparkler)'' Set something on fire for your Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Aiming the skyrocket; Screaming:)'' I AM THE GOD OF DESTRUCTION! ''(Skyrocket shoots off)''
|-
!
|''[[Sheriff Blubs]] and [[Deputy Durland]] approach the Mystery Shack as the fireworks go off.''
|-
!Blubs
|Hold on a minute. Do you have a permit for those?
|-
!Dipper
|Uh...
|-
!Stan
|Uh, do you have a permit for being totally lame? ''(He and the twins laugh)''
|-
!Mabel
|Heyoooo!
|-
!Blubs
|''(Chuckles)'' Well, I can't argue with that. ''(Walking away and waving)'' Carry on.
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs)'' But seriously though we should probably clean this mess up.
|-
!
|''Pans out to a full view of the Mystery Shack; there are many small fires around and on it. The rope holding up the flags snaps.''
|-
!Mabel
|With water balloons?
|-
!Stan
|I don't see why not.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan sitting outside on the couch drinking a [[Pitt Cola]], and Dipper running away from Mabel, who is throwing water balloons at him.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Laughs as he runs. Throws water balloon which goes about a foot before falling onto the ground)'' Seriously?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hits him with a water balloon, knocking him back. Runs by, screaming in a tribal-like fashion)''
|-
!Stan
|Ah. This is what Saturdays are for. Doing dumb things forever.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(As they jump onto the pile of water balloons)'' DUMB THINGS FOREVER! ''(Land on the water balloons which all pop into a big burst of water)''
|-
!Stan
|''(As a splash of water comes at him:)'' Whoa, there! ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holding up an icy-pop)'' To Grunkle Stan! Not just a great uncle...
|-
!Dipper
|The greatest uncle! ''(He and Mabel throw water balloons at Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs)'' Alright, alright. I tell you it's unnatural for siblings to get along as well as you do.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Waves hand dismissively)'' Ha-ha! Don't worry. We've still got plenty of summer left ''(Attacking Dipper in a hug)'' to drive each other crazy!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pushes Mabel away with a water balloon, which falls on her face)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Laughs nervously and frowns)'' Yeah, plenty of summer left. ''(Rubbing the back of his head nervously as Dipper and Mabel approach him)'' Kids, there's something I, uh, something I should tell you. It's um ''(Scratches chin)'' Well it's complicated. I... I'm gonna go refresh my soda. ''(Walks away. Cut to him walking alone behind the bushes)'' Enjoy it while you can, Stan. They'll find out sooner or later. Today's the day.
|-
!
|''A glowing red dot appears on Stan's fez.''
|-
!Stan
|What is that, a ladybug? ''(Slaps it)''
|-
!
|''More red dots target Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|What the--? Oh no!
|-
!
|''A masked agent pins Stan down. [[Agent Trigger]] approaches.''
|-
!Agent Trigger
|''(Into walkie-talkie:)'' Target secure! Take the house!
|-
!
|''Several helicopters fly above the Shack. Cut to a conufused Dipper and Mabel, surrounded by a handful of agents.''
|-
!Mabel
|What the--?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Agent
|''(Into walkie-talkie:)'' Kids are secure. Roof team! Go!
|-
!
|''Several agents rappel out of a helicopter. Cut to the Mystery Shack attic, where agents crash in and cock their weapons.''
|-
!Agent 2
|Clear!
|-
!
|''Another couple agents rush through the gift shop, wielding a bat. Another crashes through a window, using a rope.''
|-
!Agent 3
|Clear!
|-
!
|''Yet another agent breaks through Dipper and Mabel's window. Waddles is seen standing in confusion. He squeals when the agent tackles him.''
|-
!Agent 4
|Pig secure! We have secured a pig!
|-
!
|''The agents wrap yellow police caution-tape around the Shack. Several police cars are parked outside. An agent leads a struggling Stan in handcuffs.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Being led to the government vehicle)'' Ugh! Hey, hands off, you stooge!
|-
!Agent
|''(Plants Stan's face on the trunk of the police car)''
|-
!Stan
|Aah! I don't understand! What did I do that warrants ''this'' much arresting?
|-
!
|''Dipper, Mabel and [[Agent Powers]] and Agent Trigger walk up.''
|-
!Dipper
|The government guys? I thought you got [[Scary-oke|eaten by zombies]]!
|-
!Trigger
|We survived. Barely.
|-
!Powers
|I used Trigger as a human shield. He cried like a baby. ''(Walks over)''
|-
!Trigger
|What? Hey! Not in front of the special-ops guys!
|-
!Powers
|''(Holds up digital tablet)'' This is security footage of a government waste facility. ''(Pan in on screen where footage of a person in a radiation suit stealing barrels is shown as Powers continues to talk)'' At o'four hundred hours last night someone robbed three hundred gallons of dangerous waste.
|-
!Stan
|What? You think that's me?
|-
!Powers
|Don't play dumb with us, Pines.
|-
!Stan
|But I actually ''am'' dumb! ''(As he is led away by an agent)'' Last night I was stocking the gift shop. I swear!
|-
!Mabel
|Wait! Grunkle Stan! You've got the wrong guy! Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift the occasional tangerine, but he's not some evil super villain!
|-
!Powers
|''(Bending down to get at eye-level with the twins)'' Listen, kid. We've been watching your family all summer and we've seen some disturbing things. But nothing as dangerous as what your uncle is hiding. Somewhere hidden in this shack is a doomsday device! ''(To Trigger, handing him the tablet:)'' Trigger, you take the children. I'll talk to the old man. ''(To the twins:)'' Sorry to break it to you kids ''(Puts on sunglasses)'' but you don't know your uncle at all. ''(Walks away)''
|-
!
|''Trigger snaps his fingers and points at the children. Two agents approach the twins.''
|-
!Agent 5
|''(Bends down and takes Mabel's icy-pop, holding an evidence bag)'' Icy-pop. Clear.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Reaching up toward her icy-pop)'' Hey!
|-
!
|''The other agent leads the twins away. Once they are gone the first agent who took Mabel's icy-pop looks to his left to see if the coast is clear and then licks the icy-pop. Mabel and Dipper are led into a police car, and the door is shut behind them. Looking out the window they can see Stan in a government vehicle.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at them and taps on the window with his cuffed hands)'' Kids, you gotta believe me! For once I'm actually innocent! ''(As the car drives off)'' Kids!
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|''(Walking towards the Mystery Shack; In a sing-song voice:)'' Headin' into work. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doooo.
|-
!Agent 6
|Ground team! Move, move, move!
|-
!Agent 7
|Break down the door!
|-
!
|''Two agents break down door to the Mystery Shack and a helicopter flies over the Shack.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Turns around and starts walking away)'' Or maybe not.
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Gravity Falls Police Department|Gravity Falls police station]], Stan getting his mug shots taken, his prints taken, and then Stan sitting in front of a bulletin board with various pictures attached to strings that all meet up to a picture of him.''
|-
!Powers
|Stanford Pines, you stand accused of theft of government waste, conspiracy, and possession of illegal weapons. How do you plead to these charges?
|-
!Stan
|Uh, guilti-cent! I mean, inno-guilty! Um, can I have my phone call?
|-
!
|''Cut to shot of a fast food restaurant called "[[Yumberjacks]]," where [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] is at the drive-thru.''
|-
!Soos
|Okay, gimme whatever you got that comes with a free toy.
|-
!Stan
|''(Through walkie-talky:)'' Soos!
|-
!Soos
|Mr. Pines? ''(Touches drive-thru lumberjack-speaker)'' Is this some sort of... possession situation?
|-
!Stan
|''(Through walkie-talky:) ''Just pick up!
|-
!Soos
|''(Picks up walkie-talky) ''Mr. Pines, what happened? I heard you got arrested or something? I had to go get some panic food.
|-
!Stan
|''(Through walkie-talky:)'' Listen, I need something from you. You know that vending machine in the gift shop? I need you to guard it with your ''life''. No matter what happens, no matter ''who'' talks to you, don't let them touch that machine. ''(Walky-talky makes whining sound as Stan cuts out)''
|-
!Soos
|Time for a repair guy ''(Adjusts hat)'' to become a repair ''man''.
|-
!Drive-thru employee
|''(Sticks arm out to hand Soos his kid's meal)'' Sir, your Junior Yum-Yum Baby-Time Kiddo Meal?
|-
!Soos
|Just put one in my mouth. ''(Employee opens box, removes a fry, and places it in Soos' mouth. Soos makes munching noises as he chews)'' Let's do this. ''(Tires screech, Soos drives wildly through a hedge)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel in the car with Trigger. Powers speaks through a video link at the front of the vehicle.''
|-
!Powers
|We've got Mr. Pines in custody. Our men are searching the shack for the device. You take care of those kids.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' What're you gonna do to us?
|-
!Trigger
|We'll be taking you to child services.
|-
!Mabel
|Boo!
|-
!Trigger
|In the meantime, ''(Presses buttons)'' enjoy some mindless reality TV, designed to pacify you and make you stop asking questions.
|-
!
|''Cut to television screen. A surgeon in scrubs stands over a patient laying on a stretcher.''
|-
!Surgeon
|I'm about to make the incision...
|-
![[Justin Kerprank|Justin]]
|KER-PRANK! ''(Jumps out of a potted plant, surgeon screams, screen reads "[[Ker-Prank'd|KER-PRANK'D]] in large font)''
|-
!TV Announcer
|You're watching "KER-PRANK'D" with Justin Kerprank!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the twins.''
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, this is crazy. There's no way Stan was stealing hazardous waste! We gotta clear his name!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Thinks, then spots the camera at the front of the car)'' Hmm...wait a minute, the security tapes! Didn't Stan say he was restocking the gift shop last night? If we could get the Mystery Shack surveillance tapes, we could prove he's innocent!
|-
!Mabel
|We just need to think of a way out of here. Think, Mabel... ''(Looking out car window)'' Think.
|-
!
|''Their vehicle comes up beside a logging truck driven by [[Manly Dan]].''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Notices a [[Sev'ral Timez]] bumper sticker on the back and knocks on the window to get Dan's attention, writing on the foggy car window:)'' SEVRAL TIMEZ IS OVERRATED
|-
!Manly Dan
|''(Gasps)'' NOOOOO! ''(Veers the logging truck into the government vehicle, which goes into a spin and falls off the road into the forest)''
|-
!Trigger
|Mayday! Mayday! Agent down! ''(All scream, and the car crashes into the trees. Trigger gets stuck between the car and a tree branch, and struggles to get free)'' Darn branch!
|-
!Mabel
|Haha, yes! ''(Opens the door, Dipper and Mabel leave the car)''
|-
!Trigger
|Backup! Requesting backup! Ah!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pulls the earpiece out of Trigger's ear and crushes it on the ground)''
|-
!Mabel
|Come on, Dipper. We're gonna go clear our uncle's name.
|-
!Trigger
|Oh, you poor kids. You really think your uncle's innocent? I've seen it all before. ''(Mabel walks away, but Dipper pauses to listen)'' False names, double lives, one minute they're playing with water balloons, the next they're building doomsday devices. Your uncle scammed the whole world. You gonna let him scam you, too?
|-
!Dipper
|You ''(hesitates) ''you don't know what you're talking about. ''(Walks away)''
|-
!Trigger
|You're gonna regret this!! ''(Airbag inflates, Trigger cries out, the car's horn beeps)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel hiding on the side of the road. Two government vehicles pass by, and as they do, Dipper and Mabel disappear from the roadside. The camera angle changes to show them hiding in the trunk of the rear car, and an arrow-shaped sign pointing in the direction they're headed that reads "MYSTERY SHACK". Cut to a view of the countdown, which now reads roughly five hours. Cut to Stan in the interrogation room, checking his wristwatch device.''
|-
!Stan
|Only five more hours till it happens. I gotta ''be'' there! Come on, Stan, you gotta think of a way outta this. ''(Pounding head on table)'' Think! Think!
|-
!
|''Suddenly the device blinks, reading "ANOMALY IN PROGRESS." The coffee on the table floats out of its cup, along with the cup itself and various items, then crashes back down.''
|-
!Stan
|They're getting stronger. Of course, that's it!
|-
!
|''Cut to the center of town, where many cars, objects, and people float off the ground and then fall back suddenly.''
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|''(To [[Lazy Susan]]:)'' Is it just me, or did the entire world just hiccup?
|-
!Lazy Susan 
|I'm sure it's just a baby-sized earthquake.
|-
!Tyler
|Aww, baby-sized!
|-
!
|''Cut to view of the laptop, which shows the countdown that Stan initiated. McGucket is in his shack, packing a bag.''
|-
!McGucket
|It's happening! The End Times! When that machine activates... I gotta get outta town! ''(Shoving a raccoon into a bag)'' Get in there, raccoon wife! Git! ''(Runs off while a helicopter flies past overhead)''
|-
!
|''Cut to overhead view of the Mystery Shack, surrounded by agents. Dipper and Mabel are hiding in a bush near the Shack.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, here's the plan. I'll take out those two guard guys, you karate chop the other dude in the neck and then we'll back flip through the front door!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, aren't you forgetting the simpler solution?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, right.
|-
!
|''Cut to two agents looking at the Rock that looks like a face rock.''
|-
!Agent
|So is it a rock, or is it a face?
|-
!Agent 2
|I think, it's... a metaphor.
|-
!
|''As they ponder, [[Mabel's grappling hook]] shoots overhead through the Shack's (now broken) window. Dipper & Mabel slide along the rope into the Shack. They dash down the stairs, avoiding detection from the agents inside the Shack, and head into Stan's office, locking the door behind them. Then they fist bump.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright. If I was Stan, where would I hide those surveillance tapes? ''(Looks on the bookshelf and in a filing cabinet)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Seeing a bolt on the Jackalope head mounted on wall)'' Wait! The antelabbit!
|-
!Dipper
|Don't you mean "jackalope?"
|-
!Mabel
|Pfft, that can't be right. ''(Fixes the jackalope's bent antler, and the wall turns open to reveal two old-looking TV monitors and a tape player)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Yes!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Points to a tape halfway in the player)'' It's this week, this is it! ''(Pushes it in)''
|-
!
|''Cut to tape of Wendy, Soos, and Mabel in the Mystery Shack's gift shop, where Soos is doing the worm dance.''
|-
!Mabel & Wendy
|''(On tape:)'' Go! Go! Go! Go!
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Dipper:) ''Someone yelled "Wormy Dance." We had to! Fast-forward.
|-
!
|''(Tape fast-forwards through several hours)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha! There it is! Stan restocking like he said! And the date shows it was last night! It's proof! He's innocent!
|-
!
|''On the tape, Stan sneaks out of the shop at around 7PM.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Fast forwards through till 8PM, seeing that Stan has not returned)'' ...Uhh-oh.
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, maybe he's just going to the bathroom outdoors. The way nature intended!
|-
!
|''Cut back to surveillance tape. At 5AM, a figure in a haz-mat suit is wheeling barrels of radioactive waste into the gift shop.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no, Stan, you didn't...
|-
!Mabel
|Don't panic. That could be anyone in that suit!
|-
!Stan
|''(On the tape, drops a barrel on his foot)'' Gah! Hot Belgian waffles! Wait, I'm alone. I can swear for real! ''(Takes a deep breath)'' SON OF A--
|-
!Dipper
|''(Shuts off the tape as Mabel covers her ears)'' That's him, alright.
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, okay, so maybe Grunkle Stan stole some toxic waste. That doesn't mean he's leading a nefarious double life!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pulls a box from under the TV screen)'' Mabel, I'm not so sure about that... ''(Takes a lamp from the desk and turns it on, revealing a box full of passports and IDs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(She and Dipper looking through the box)'' What? What is all this? ''(Reading from one of the IDs:)'' "Stetson Pinefield?"
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading from IDs:)'' "Hal Forrester?" "Andrew '8-Ball' Alcatraz?" These are fake IDs, Mabel! You wouldn't need these unless you were trying to hide your real identity!
|-
!Mabel
|But why would Stan do that? ''(Picks a newspaper clipping out of the box, whose headline reads "STAN PINES DEAD." She passes the clipping to Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|WHAT?! "Stan Pines ''Dead?''"
|-
!Mabel
|''(Reading from article clipping:)'' "Foul play suspected in Pines' death." Fiery car crash, brakes cut...by who?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks out another clipping that shows a picture of Stan)'' "Unnamed grifter at large?" Why would they call him unnamed? Unless Stan...
|-
!Mabel
|Isn't...
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Stan?! ''(Look up at the portrait of Stan on the wall behind them)''
|-
!
|''Cut to countdown clock, now reading under sixteen minutes.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pacing)'' Stan Pines is dead?! Then who have we been living with? It doesn't make any sense!
|-
!Mabel
|There has to be some explanation. Maybe we're getting Ker-Prank'd! Justin Kerprank is gonna jump up from behind one of these plants ''(Turns to look at potted plant) ''any minute now! ''(After a brief pause she scoots forward and looks into the potted plant)'' ...Any minute, Justin.
|-
!Dipper
|I can't believe it. This whole summer I've been looking for answers and the biggest mystery was right under our nose.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Digs through clippings)'' Ugh, there's gotta be some kind of explanation in here somewhere. What the... "secret code to hideout?"
|-
!Dipper
|Let me see that. ''(Takes out [[Journal 3]] and his [[Dipper's black light|portable black light]])'' "A1, B, C3"... I've never seen a code like this.
|-
!Mabel
|Wait! I have! Dipper, it's the vending machine!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan checking the wristwatch device, which reads about thirteen minutes now.''

!Powers
|''(Enters interrogation room with two other agents)'' Alright, Pines. Playtime is over. Chopper's ready to dust off to Washington. I'll enjoy putting you away.
|-
!Stan
|What? Um, can't we stick around for maybe one minute? Uh, one minute thirty seconds?
|-
!Powers
|We're not falling for your games, Pines. You've been running your whole life. Your time is finally up.
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at a clock on the wall)'' Bathroom break? Just give me... fifteen seconds!
|-
!Powers
|''(As he unlocks Stan's handcuffs)'' Sorry, but you've got a flight to catch.
|-
!Stan
|''(Watch begins to beep)'' Oh, yeah? So do you.
|-
!Powers
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Everything floats up from the floor. Stan kicks the table into the agents. Cut to outside the police station, where everything is losing its grip on the world. Cut back to Stan in the station.''
|-
!Powers
|Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Aah!
|-
!
|''Stan hits Powers with the back of his chair, turns over, thrusts away from the wall, catches the cuff key in his hands and un-cuffs himself.''
|-
!Powers
|Hey! Dang it, get back here! Men, get him!
|-
!
|''Stan kicks one of the agents in the chest, catches his wallet and hops from agent to agent out of the room.''
|-
!Powers
|No! You won't get away with this!
|-
!
|''Stan slams the door in Powers' face, locking it behind him. His watch beeps and gravity is working again. Behind Stan, Durland falls out of a room next door, followed by a blindfolded Blubs, swinging a bat at a piñata.''
|-
!Blubs
|Gon' getcha, gon' getcha!
|-
!
|''The agents in the interrogation room slide to the floor with a squeaking sound.''
|-
!Powers
|Ow!
|-
!
|''Outside, everything hits the ground again, and Stan runs out of the station to a taxi.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Panting; To taxi driver:)'' Do you know where the Mystery Shack is?
|-
!Taxi Driver
|Uh, yeah?
|-
!Stan
|Okay. Here's a hundred bucks. Drive as far away from the Shack as possible, and don't stop when the cops start chasing you!
|-
!
|''(The driver shrugs and speeds away, while Stan hides behind a wrecked car as the agents come out of the station.)''
|-
!Powers
|He's getting away! ''(Sees taxi)'' Obviously, follow that cab!
|-
!
|''Cut to Shack exterior. Trigger drives up to order the other agents.''
|-
!Trigger
|Stanford escaped! He's at large! We need to sweep the town! ''(As agents disperse from the Shack)'' Move! Move! Move!
|-
!Soos
|''(Sneaks in to guard the vending machine)'' Alright Soos, remember the plan. Protect the machine, earn Stan's trust, legally get adopted by Stan, change name to Stan Junior.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos?
|-
!Soos
|Ahh! Oh, kids! Where've you been?
|-
!Dipper
|What are you doing here?
|-
!Soos
|Stan gave me a mission to protect this machine! Ha! And I thought ''I'' loved snacks.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, listen. Something huge is going on here. If Stan is hiding some dangerous secret, we need to find out what it is! I need you to step aside.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, just let us through so we can prove this is all just a big misunderstanding.
|-
!Soos
|Guys, I know this seems crazy, but I promised Stan I would guard this with my life.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Dipper nods at her)'' I'm sorry, Soos. ''(Blows a handful of glitter directly into Soos' face, getting it in his eyes)''
|-
!Soos
|Aah! Attack glitter! It's pretty, but it hurts! 
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Jump on Soos)'' C'mon Soos... c'mon... c'mon... please!
|-
!Soos
|''(Holds them back as they try to get past)'' Aww, c'mon, I don't wanna fight you guys! This hurts me more than it hurts you! ''(As he is getting kicked in the face by Mabel)'' Ah! Seriously, it hurts me ''way'' more that it hurts you!
|-
!
|''Dipper reaches for the number pad and enters the code. All shout as the vending machine swings forward, shoving them to the floor. All cough, then gasp at the secret passage behind the machine.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Leading the way down the stairs)'' It's like something from a video game...
|-
!Mabel
|Or a dream...
|-
!Dipper
|...Or a nightmare.
|-
!
|''Cut to shot of Stan's feet as he races back to the Shack, cut to Soos, Dipper & Mabel heading down in the elevator, then cut back to Stan, checking the watch.''
|-
!Stan
|I gotta be there when it happens! ''(Running through the woods. Rips part of his suit on a branch)'' Aah!
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos, Dipper & Mabel entering Stan's lab. All gasp.''
|-
!Mabel
|Guys, are we dreaming? Somebody wake me up.
|-
!Dipper
|This can't be real...
|-
!Soos
|I don't understand. Why would Mr. Pines have all this?
|-
!Dipper
|It's just like that bunker in the woods...
|-
!Soos
|But what is it doing underneath the Mystery Shack?
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, okay, so he's got a ''huge'' gigantic lab. That doesn't mean anything bad! Everyone's got secrets! ''(Sees the picture of her and Dipper, picks it up)'' It's still Stan, and he loves us. And we love him. Right?
|-
!Dipper
|It can't be... it's impossible. The ''other'' two journals? All this time... all this time, Stan had them?! I can't believe it! Was anything he said to us real?! ''(Kicks desk)'' Why would he have those journals?!
|-
!Soos
|Maybe ''he's'' the author.
|-
!Dipper
|Or maybe he stole them from the author! Maybe the reason he has all those fake IDs is because he ''is'' a master criminal, and this machine is his master plan! (''Opens each journal to the page with the portal on it, lays them accordingly, and turns on his black light. Gasps)''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading from the journals:)'' "I was wrong the whole time. The machine was meant to create knowledge but it is ''too powerful''. I was deceived, and now it is too late. The device, if fully operational, could ''tear our universe apart!'' It must not fall into the wrong hands. If the clock ever reaches zero, our universe is doomed!" ''(All look at the countdown clock, now reading one minute, thirty seconds)''
|-
!Soos
|It's the final countdown! Just like they always sung about!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flips through journal to a page reading "MANUAL OVERRIDE")'' The agents were right! We have to shut it down! ''(All enter the portal room, gasp, ground begins to shake)'' There! Quick! Turn these, together! ''(All turn three keys, a device near the center of the room pops open to reveal a large red button)'' That's it! The shutdown switch! This all stops... now!
|-
!Stan
|DON'T TOUCH THAT BUTTON!! ''(Standing in the doorway, panting)'' Dipper, just back away. ''(Dipper's hand remains suspended inches over the button)'' Please don't press that shutdown button, you gotta trust me.
|-
!Dipper
|And I should trust you ''why?!'' After you stole radioactive waste? After you lied to us all summer?! I don't even know who you are!
|-
!Stan
|Look, I know this all seems nuts, but I need that machine to stay on! If you'd just let me explain-- ''(Wrist device beeps, ground begins to shake again)'' Uh-oh, oh, no! Brace yourselves!

|''(Punches him in the face)''
|-
!Stan
|Oh! Ow! What the heck was that for?!
|-
!Ford
|This was an insanely risky move: restarting the [[Universe portal|portal]]! Didn't you read my warnings?!
|-
!Stan
|Warnings, schmarnings. How's about maybe a thanks for saving you from what appears to be, I don't know, some kind of sci-fi sideburn dimension?
|-
!Ford
|Thank you? You really think I'm gonna ''thank you'' after what you DID THIRTY YEARS AGO?!

!Stan
|What ''I'' did? Why, you ungrateful... ''(Tries to punch him but Ford ducks and grabs him)'' Don't expect me to go easy on you, just because you're... family. ''(As Ford slams him to the ground)'' Ah!
|-
![[Mabel Pines]]
|Hey, hi. Mabel here. Quick question: WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?!
|-
!Ford
|Stan, you didn't tell me there were children down here. And some sort of large, hairless gopher?
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|Heh heh. I get that a lot.
|-
!Stan
|They're your family, Poindexter. Shermie's grandkids.
|-
!Ford
|I-I have a niece and nephew? ''(Shakes Mabel's hand)'' Greetings. Do kids still say greetings? I haven't been in this dimension for a ''really'' long time.
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, a six-fingered handshake? It's a full finger friendlier than normal!
|-
!Ford
|Heha, I like this kid. She's weird.
|-
![[Dipper Pines]]
|I-I can't believe it. You're the author of the [[Journal (disambiguation)|journals]]!

''(Walking in circles) ''I've been waiting for so long to meet you, I-I don't know what to say I have so many question I ''(Starts breathing heavily)'' Oooooohhh I think I'm gonna throw up. ''(As Mabel comes over) ''Hmmpf! No-no, false alarm. Hmmpf! Just gotta ride it out!
|-
!Ford
|Listen, there'll be time for introductions later. But first, tell me, Stan: are there any security breaches? Does ''anyone else'' know about this portal?
|-
!Stan
|No, just us. Also maybe the entire U.S. government.
|-
!Ford
|The ''what''?!
|-
![[Agent Powers]]
|''(Seen on security camera; to other agents)'' Fan out! We're not going anywhere till we find Stan Pines and those kids!
|-
!Ford
|''(Sighs)'' Okay. It's all right. We've got a ''while'' before they find this [[Underground laboratory|room]]. We just need to lay low and ''think of a plan''.
|-
!Mabel
|Well, it looks like we're stuck down here for a while. Who wants to tell us their entire mysterious backstory?
|-
!Ford
|Yes, I have some questions about this myself, Stanley.
|-
!Dipper
|Stanley?
|-
!Mabel
|But your name is Stanford.
|-
!Ford
|Wait, you took ''my'' name?! What have you been doing all these years, you knucklehead?!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, Grunkle Stan, no more lies! You owe us some answers: What's the deal with this portal? Why did you keep this a secret?
|-
!Mabel
|And what happened between you and your brother?
|-
!Soos
|I hope all this aligns ''exactly'' with my fanfic, Stan. If not, I will be very disappointed.
|-
!Stan
|Okay okay okay, I have a lot of explaining to do. It all started... a lifetime ago... nineteen sixty something. [[Glass Shard Beach, New Jersey]]. ''(Cut to a seagull landing on a sign that says "GLASS SHARD BEACH-HOME OF GLASS SHARD WATER TOFFEE" and coughing up a bottlecap)'' I lived with my [[Caryn Pines|ma]] and [[Filbrick Pines|pa]] in the Lead Paint District in the [[Pines Pawns|family pawn shop]]. ''(Cut to Stan's father sitting down in a chair)'' Dad was a strict man. Tough as a cinderblock and not easily impressed.
|-
!Filbrick Pines
|I'm not impressed.
|-
!Stan
|Ma was a pathological liar, which served her well as a phone psychic.
|-
!Caryn Pines
|''(To someone on phone)'' That'll be 99 cents an hour.... No, ''you're'' overpriced.... Yeah, I predicted you were gonna hang up.
|-
!Stan
|''(Cut to Ford as a child reading in the top bunk of a bed)'' And then there was my nerdy twin brother, Stanford. As if his abnormally high IQ wasn't enough, he also had a rare birth defect: ''(Cut to an X-ray of Stanford's hands, with the extra pinkies circled and the word "abnormality" written above)'' six fingers on each hand. ''(Cut to Ford drawing in a notebook)'' Which might have explained his obsession with sci-fi mystery weirdness. ''(Cut to Stan as a child with a bucket on his head running into a wall)'' As for me, I had what mom liked to call: personality. ''(In the flashback, Stan throws the bucket off his head and the twins laugh and run off.)'' But as different as we were, we were the perfect team. ''(Cut to the twins walking around in a cave)'' And every day we'd wander the beach, looking for adventure. ''(In the flashback)'' Whoooaa...
|-
!Ford
|''(In the flashback)'' A shipwrecked sailboat, possibly haunted by pirate ghosts!
|-
!Stan
|This is the greatest thing I've ever seen! And I've once seen a dead rat floatin' in a bucket!
|-
!Ford
|''(Pushes him)'' Hahaha, ew, what's wrong with you?
|-
!Stan
|Huh, you know what this thing's missin'?
|-
!Ford
|Flags.
|-
!
|''Cut to the twins pushing the boat, which has their shirts hanging off the masts, down the beach. They are both badly sunburned.''
|-
!Ford and Stan
|Kings of New Jersey! Kings of New Jersey! Kings of New Jersey!
|-
!Ford
|''(Kneeling in front of the boat which has "STAN O' WAR" painted on its side)'' I dub thee: the Stan O' War! ''(Gets hit in the head by a small rock)'' Ow! What the heck? ''(Glares at three children standing nearby)''
|-
![[Crampelter]]
|Well, well, if it ain't the loser twins. Nice boat. Ya get it at the dump? Heheheheheheheh! ''(high fives his two friends)''
|-
!Stan
|You would know, Crampelter! Get lost!
|-
!Crampelter
|Listen, dorks, and listen good. ''(Pointing at Ford)'' You're a six-fingered freak, ''(Pointing at Stan)'' and you're just a... dumber, sweatier version o' him. And you're lucky you have each other because neither of you will ever make any friends! ''(Leaves with his friends)'' Ha, hahahaha! Dorks and losers...
|-
!Ford
|''(Looking at his hand)''
|-
!Stan
|Hey. Don't let those idiots get to you.
|-
!Ford
|But I am a freak. I just wonder if there's anywhere in the world where weirdos like me fit in.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, chin up, buddy. Look. ''(He and Ford look at the sea)'' One of these days, you and me are gonna sail away from this dumb town. We'll hunt for treasure, get all the girls, and be an unstoppable team of adventurers.
|-
!Ford
|You really mean it?
|-
!Stan
|High six?
|-
!Ford
|High six. ''("High sixes" him)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Voice-over from the present:)'' Those were the good times. Those bullies may have been right about us not making many friends, but when push comes to shove, you only really need one. ''(In the flashback, Ford is solving a math problem on a chalkboard while Stan draws a monster-caricature of his school mistress. She hits him on the head with a ruler. Cut to the twins a few years later sitting on the boat. Cut to a few years later, when Ford is at a party laughing nervously at an angry girl, who pours her drink on him. Stan walks over and pours his drink on himself.)'' Ford's brains seemed to get more impressive every year. So did our pet project. ''(He and Ford are putting a sail on their boat; cut to Stan in class blowing a paper through a straw at a student next to him, then leaning over and copying off of Ford)'' Sure I got in more than my fair share of trouble, but when your brother's the smartest kid in school, you've always got a leg up on the competition. ''(Cut to Ford winning a science fair, and then Stan comes over and puts his arm around him)'' The future was lookin' bright. For both of us. Till one day... ''(Cut to Stan eating [[Toffee Peanuts]] in class while Ford writes something)''

|-
![[Principal of Glass Shard Beach High School|Principal]]
|Now, Mr. Pines, I'd like to speak with you very frankly if I may.
|-
!Filbrick
|Very frankly is the only way I speak.
|-
!Principal
|You have two sons: one of them is incredibly gifted, the other one is standing outside of this room and his name's Stanley.
|-
!Caryn
|What are you saying?
|-
!Principal
|I'm saying your son, Stanford, is a GENIUS! All his teachers are going bananas over his science fair experiment! ''(Gives Ford a pamphlet)'' Ya ever heard of West Coast Tech? Best college in the country. Their graduates turn science fiction into science FACT! The admissions team is visiting tomorrow to check out Stanford's experiment. Your son may be a future millionare, Mr. Pines.
|-
!Filbrick
|I'm impressed.
|-
!Caryn
|But what about our little free spirit, Stanley?
|-
!Principal
|That clown? At this rate he'll be lucky to graduate high school. Look, there's a saltwater taffy store on the dock. And somebody's gotta get paid to scrape the barnacles off of it. Stanford's goin' places. But hey, look on the bright side: at least you'll have one son here in New Jersey forever.
|-
!Stan
|''(Sits down sadly outside the door; cut to Ford and Stan on the swings)'' Heh. Joke's on them if they think you wanna go to some stuffy college on the other side of the country. Once we get the Stan O' War complete, it's gonna be beaches, babes, and international treasure hunting for us.
|-
!Ford
|Look, Stan, I can't pass up a chance like this. This school has cutting edge programs and multi-dimensional paradigm theory.
|-
!Stan
|Beep boop. I am a nerd robot. That's you. That's what you sound like.
|-
!Ford
|Heheh. Ah, well, if the college board isn't impressed with my experiment tomorrow, then okay, I'll do the treasure-hunting thing.
|-
!Stan
|And if they are?
|-
!Ford
|''(Punches him)'' Well then, I guess you better come visit me on the other side of the ''country''. Haha. ''(Walks away)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Voice-over from the present:)'' Without Ford I was just half of a dynamic duo. I couldn't make it without him. ''(Cut to Stan walking through the science experiments at the school at night.)'' And now, thanks to that dumb college, I was gonna lose my brother forever. ''(In the flashback, Stan stops at Ford's experiment. In the flashback:)'' This is all ''your'' fault, ya dumb machine! ''(Punches the table and a piece comes off the machine)'' Oh no. Oh no no, what did I do? ''(Puts the piece back on)'' There. Alright. Good as new. Probably. ''(Puts the tarp back on and leaves; cut to Ford in front of the tarp the next morning with the college board)''
|-
!Man
|Alright, kid. Show us what ya got.
|-
!Ford
|Okay! Well, what would you say if I told you that the future of technology was beneath this sheet? ''(Pulls tarp off)''
|-
!Man
|I'd say that we wasted a car trip.
|-
!Ford
|''What? (Looks at machine, which isn't moving)'' But it was stable yesterday! A fuse must have blown or something.
|-
!Man
|''(Crosses "Stanford Pines" off of a list of names)'' Kid, a perpetual motion machine has one job: to not stop. I don't think you're West Coast Tech material. ''(Leads the other college board members away)''
|-
!Ford
|No, wait! Don't go! I worked so hard! ''(Steps on an empty Toffee Peanuts bag, picks it up and growls)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Cut to their house; he is sitting on a couch playing with a paddleball)'' One-paddle-paddle-paddle, two-paddle-paddle. Man, that [[Real people mentioned in Gravity Falls|Jackie-O]], what a fox. ''(Ford enters)'' Hey, what's the word, Sixer?
|-
!Ford
|''(Holds up Toffee Peanuts bag)'' Can you explain what ''this'' was doing next to my broken project?!
|-
!Stan
|Ho-okay. I might have accidentally been, horsing around-
|-
!Ford
|This was no accident, Stan; ''you'' did this! You did this because you couldn't handle me going to college on my own!
|-
!Stan
|Look, this was a mistake! Although if you think about it, maybe there's a silver lining. Huh? Treasure hunting?
|-
!Ford
|Are you kidding me? Why would I want to do anything with the person who sabotaged my entire ''future''?! ''(Shoves Stan onto the couch)''
|-
!Filbrick
|''(Picks up Stanley by his shirt)'' You did ''what'', you knucklehead?
|-
!Caryn
|''(Comes out of a room with a crying baby)'' Stanley? What's goin' on in here?
|-
!Stan
|Wait, no, I can explain; it was a mistake!
|-
!Filbrick
|''(Throws Stan outside)'' You ignoramus! Your brother was gonna be our ticket out of this dump! All you ever do is lie and cheat right on your brother's coattails. Well this time you cost our family potential ''millions''! And until ''you'' make us a fortune, you aren't welcome in this household. ''(Throws a duffel bag at him)''
|-
!Stan
|What?! Stanford, tell him he's bein' crazy! ''(Ford, who was watching out his window, closes his curtains)'' Stanford? Don't leave me hangin'. High six? ''(Filbrick slams the door)'' Fine. I can make it on my own! I don't need you! I don't need anyone! I'll make millions and you'll ''rue'' the day you turned your back on me! ''(Gets in his [[Stanmobile|car]] and drives away; voice-over from the present:)'' Thanks to one dumb mistake I had no brother, no home, no nothing. But I had a plan to fix everything.

|-
!Mabel
|Oh! This story's so sad! I know what you two little broken teacups need: to hug it out! Hug it out! Hug train's comin' in the station. HUGAPOLOOZA! TWO THOUSAND!
|-
!Stan
|Kid, will ya knock that off? I'm tryin' to tell my life story here. ''(Cut to Stan as a young man with a metal detector on the beach)'' I had decided I wasn't gonna show my face at home until I made something of myself. Unfortunately, the treasure-hunting business was slow going. Apparently gold was some kind of... rare metal. ''(In the flashback, Stan sees a billboard advertising the traveling salesman lifestyle and throws his metal detector away)'' Luckily I struck a different kind of gold.... in ''sales. (Cut to Stan in a commercial; in commercial)'' Hi! I'm Stan Pines of Stan Co. Enterprises. Are sick of ''this'' always happening to ''you''? ''(A pitcher of juice is thrown at him, getting juice all over him)'' Then you need the Shammy of the future! ''(Begins to wipe himself off, then the commercial skips ahead to him completely clean)'' Made with the same material astronauts use to clean up cranberry stains on the moon! That's the Sham Total! It's a total sham. ''(Voice-over from the present:)'' I had made my mark, all right. Unfortunately, so did the Shammies. ''(Cut to a woman using a Sham Total to clean a robe, but the blue dye from the Shammy leaks onto it.)'' Apparently the cheap dye I used to color them only made stains worse. ''(Cut to an angry mob)'' Customers went crazy about that. Fortunately they were using Stan Co. brand pitchforks. ''(The mob's pitchforks break; Stanley drives by them in his car; i flashback)'' SUCKERS! ''(Voice-over from present)'' I was officially banned from New Jersey, but with a quick name change, Steve Pinington was ready to take on Pennsylvania. ''(In another commercial)'' Hi! I'm Steve Pinington! ''(Pulls at Band-aid on his arm)'' Are you sick of bandages that are hard to remove? Then what you need is the Rip Off! The Rip Off ''won't'' give you rashes, I repeat: it ''won't'' give you rashes. ''(The words "IT WON'T GIVE YOU RASHES" appears on the screen; voice-over from present as angry mob with rashes chases Stanley out of Pennsylvania)'' It gave ya rashes. ''(Cut to a map of USA with a line moving around it)'' I traveled the whole country, sometimes outside of it, always one step ahead of the law, looking for something that would be my big break.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa. So that explains all the fake IDs.
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Ford)'' But, wait, what about you? Did you end up going to your dream school?
|-
!Ford
|Not exactly. ''(Cut back to the past, on the auditorium of Backupsmore University)''
|-
!Speaker
|''(Standing at podium)'' Alright, I know Backupsmore wasn't anyone's first choice, but what we lack in prestige, we make up for in ''mostly bug-free dorms''! I'm sure your families are proud, more or less.
|-
!Ford
|''(Sitting in the audience, looks at a picture of his family; cut to him studying in his dorm; voice-over from the present)'' In a place like that, I had to work twice as hard. Luckily, that's what I do best. I went from undergrad to PhD three years ahead of schedule, wrote a thesis that was nationally ranked, and was awarded an enormous grant for my own scientific research! But what to study. ''(Cut to Ford looking at his hand, then at a book about anomalies)'' My whole life I'd been teased for my six fingers. But that got my thinking about anomalies: things that were odd, unusual, statistically improbable. And according to my investigations, there was one place with a higher concentration of these things than anywhere else. ''(Cut to Ford standing in front of a map of USA with dots marked on it, most of which are in Oregon. Ford circles Oregon)'' A small lumber town in roadkill country, Oregon: [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]].
|-
!Stan
|''(in a flashback, marks Xs on a map of USA titles "STATES I'M BANNED IN"; Voice-over from present)'' Meanwhile, your old uncle Stan was doing great. I had come up with a sophisticated new business strategy. ''(In the flashback, picks up a lottery card and begins scratching some circles off with a coin, in flashback)'' Come on, owl... ''(scratches another owl)'' owl... ''(Scratches a football player with an omelet)'' football player with an omelet!? Gah! ''(Crumples the card up and throws it against the window; voice-over from present)'' I was in great shape, living on my own, and the best part was: I didn't need help from nobody. ''(Cut to him in the flashback dialing a number at a payphone)''
|-
!Ford
|''(In flashback, over phone)'' Hello? This is Stanford Pines.
|-
!Stan
|''(Hangs up phone and sighs)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Driving into Gravity Falls; voice-over from the present)'' I was heading out on my own as well. ''(Standing in front of the Mystery Shack being constructed)'' I set to work using my grant money to investigate the strange properties of this town, but what would I find here? ''(A giant hand grabs his car)'' Bingo. I began to investigate at once. ''(Cut to him setting a Journal on a table, tracing his hand, pasting the trace on the Journal, and writing "1" on it)'' I knew I'd have to record my findings. I began to keep a [[Journal 1|journal]]...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Screams)'' THE JOURNALS!!!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present. Everyone is staring at Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|Sorry, sorry, ''(Clears throat)'' just got excited there... About the journals... Keep-keep talking.
|-
!Ford
|I began to keep a Journal...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Screams)''
|-
!Ford
|Just going to ignore that. There were anomalies everywhere. And the more I looked, the more I saw. ''(Cut to him as a young man catching [[Eye-Bats]] and putting them into a jar, then recording it in his Journal; the [[Shape Shifter]] hatches in front of him, then immediately turns into a cup. Stanford writes in his journal about the "floating cliffs". Cut to him and a [[Gnomes|gnome]] that looks like Shmebulock; in flashback)'' Fascinating, what did you say your name was?
|-
!Gnome
|Shmebulock... Senior.
|-
!Ford
|''(Writes in [[journal 3]] and looks at cover; voice-over from present)'' It was finally a place where I felt at home, but something nagged at me: where did it all come from? It seemed to me the answer must come from outside of our world, a dimension of weirdness leaking into ours. I realized the only way to understand Gravity Falls would be to build a gateway: a portal to the source of its weirdness. ''(In the flashback, is drawing the portal map in the journals)'' But I couldn't make it alone. I decided to call up my old college buddy, [[Old Man McGucket|Fiddleford McGucket]], a young but brilliant mechanic, who was wasting his talent trying to make personal computers in some garage in [[wikipedia:Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. ''(Cut to McGucket's garage full of computers, where he is playing a banjo when the phone rings. He picks it up)''
|-
!McGucket
|Hello? Fiddleford Computermajigs?.. You say you're tryin' to build a transuniversal polydimensional metavortex? Well that's mathematically feasible! I reckon. ''(Spits)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Cut to Ford and McGucket working on the portal, when the power surges)'' Many long nights were spent perfecting the machine. It would be a crowning achievement of my studies. An answer to the source of this town's anomalies.
|-
![[Tyler's mother]]
|''(To [[Tyler Cutebiker]], who is on a bike)'' Git out, git out, git out! ''(The two hurriedly leave the area)''
|-
!Ford
|''(He and McGucket carry a dummy to the portal)'' The time had come to test it. ''(In flashback)'' Ready, and... ''(They release the dummy, but a rope from it catches McGucket and he flies toward the portal, screaming)'' What? ''(Grabs the rope and holds him, back but McGucket's head is in the portal)'' I got ya, buddy! ''(pulls the rope and McGucket and the dummy come out of the portal; to McGucket)'' What is it? Is it working? What did you see?!
|-
!McGucket
|Ahh! VOTMZRIG IVSKRX OORY.
|-
!Ford
|Fiddleford?
|-
!McGucket
|When Gravity Falls and earth becomes sky, fear [[Bill Cipher|the beast with just one eye]].
|-
!Ford
|Fiddleford, get a hold of yourself, you're not making any sense. ''(Puts his hand on McGucket's shoulder)''
|-
!McGucket
|''(Jerks away)'' This machine is dangerous. You'll bring about the end of the world with this. Destroy it before it destroys us all!
|-
!Ford
|I can't ''destroy'' this; it's my life's work!
|-
!McGucket
|I fear we've unleashed a grave danger on the world. One I'd just as soon forget. I quit! ''(Walks away)''
|-
!Ford
|Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you! I don't need anyone! ''(A whispering sound is heard)'' What? Who said that? ''(Backs into a wall; voice-over from the present)'' I was in over my head, and feared I was losing my sanity. I needed help. Someone I could trust.
|-
!Stan
|''(Cut to him in his apartment when he hears knocking. Grabs baseball bat)'' Just give me a few more days, Rico! I'll pay your goons back, I swear! ''(A Gravity Falls postcard comes through his mail slot. He looks out and sees the post man leaving. He looks at the postcard which says "PLEASE COME! -FORD. Cut to him walking up to Ford's door)'' You haven't seen your brother in over ten years. It's okay. He's family. He won't bite. ''(Knocks)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Opens door)'' Who is it?! Have you come to steal my eyes?! ''(Points crossbow)''
|-
!Stan
|Well, I can always count on you for a warm welcome.
|-
!Ford
|Stanley, did anyone follow you? Anyone at all?
|-
!Stan
|Eh, hello to you, too, pal. ''(As Ford grabs him and pulls him inside)'' Ah!
|-
!Ford
|''(Shines flashlight in Stan's eyes)''
|-
!Stanley
|''(Pushes him away)'' Ah! Hey! What is this?
|-
!Ford
|Sorry, I just had to make sure you weren't... uh, it's nothing. Come in, come in. ''(Darts away)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Following him)'' Uh, you gonna explain what's going on, here? You're acting like Mom after her tenth cup of coffee.
|-
!Ford
|''(Holding Journal 1)'' Listen, there isn't much time. I've made ''huge'' mistakes and I don't know who I can trust anymore. ''(Turns the head of a skeleton away from him)''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, uh, easy there. Let's talk this through, okay?
|-
!Ford
|I have something to show you. Something you won't believe.
|-
!Stan
|Look, I've been around the world, okay? Whatever it is, I'll understand. ''(Standing in the portal room)'' There is ''nothing'' about this I understand.
|-
!Ford
|It's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension. I created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe. But it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction. That's why I shut it down and hid my journals, which explained how to operate it. There's only one journal left. And you are the ''only'' person I can trust to take it. ''(Gives Stan the journal)'' I have something to ask of you: you remember our plans to sail around the world on a boat? ''(Stan smiles.)'' Take this book, get on a boat, and sail as far away as ya can! To the edge of the Earth! Bury it where no one can find it!
|-
!Stan
|That's ''it''?! You finally wanna see me after ten years, and it's to tell me to get as far away from you as possible!?
|-
!Ford
|Stanley, you don't understand what I'm up against! What I've been through!
|-
!Stan
|No, no. You don't understand what ''I've'' been through! I've been to prison in three different countries! I once had to chew my way out of the ''trunk of a car''! You think you've got problems? ''I've got a mullet, Stanford!'' Meanwhile, where have you been? Living it up in your fancy house in the woods! Selfishly hoarding your college money, because ''you only care about yourself''.
|-
!Ford
|I'm selfish? ''I'm selfish'', Stanley? How can you ''say'' that after costing me my dream school?! I'm giving you a chance to do the first worthwhile thing in your life and you won't even listen!
|-
!Stan
|Well, listen to this: you want me to get rid of this book? Fine, I'll get rid of it right now! ''(Takes out lighter)''
|-
!Ford
|No! ''(Grabs the journal)'' You don't understand!
|-
!Stan
|''(Takes it back)'' You said you wanted me to have it so I'll do what I want with it!
|-
!Ford
|My research! ''(Tackles Stan, then runs for the journal, but Stan trips him. Ford runs after him)'' Stanley, give it back! ''(Pushes him onto some of the buttons)''
|-
!Stan
|You want it back, you're gonna have to try harder than that!
|-
!
|''The portal turns on.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Trying to pull the journal away from Ford)'' You left me behind, you jerk! It was supposed to be us forever, you ruined my life!
|-
!Ford
|You ruined your own life! ''(Kicks him into the side of the control panel, branding the symbol onto his back. Stan screams and falls to the floor)'' Stanley! Oh my gosh I'm so sorry! Are you alr-
|-
!
|''Stan punches Ford, who stumbles backward and trips over the lever. Stan follows him''.
|-
!Stan
|Some brother ''you'' turned out to be. You care more about your dumb mysteries than your family? Well then YOU CAN HAVE 'EM. ''(Shoves Ford back into the portal light, and he starts getting sucked into it)'' Whoa, whoa, hey, what's going on? Hey, hey, Stanford-
|-
!Ford
|Stanley! Stanley, help me!
|-
!Stan
|Oh, no, what do I do?!!
|-
!Ford
|Stanley! Stanley! Do something! STANLEY! ''(Throws Journal 1 at Stan and disappears into the portal)''
|-
!
|''A flash of white engulfs everything. When it fades, Stan is lying on the floor.''
|-
!Stan
|Stanford?
|-
!
|''Ford's glasses fall onto the floor.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Runs to the portal)'' Stanford, come back! I-I DIDN'T MEAN IT! ''(Pounds on the side of the portal)''
|-
!
|''The portal turns off.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Runs to the lever and tries to pull it to no avail)'' I just got him back! I can't lose him again! Ah, come on! STANFORD! ''(Echoes into the portal; voice-over from the present)'' I'd lost him. I didn't know if he was dead or alive in some distant galaxy, but I knew his journal must have the answer to getting him back. Somehow. ''(Flips to the back of Journal 1, where it says "continued in [[journal 2|journal #2]]"; cut to Stan laying on the couch with Journal 1 and Ford's glasses at night)'' I didn't get much sleep that night. ''(Looks at the glasses)'' Or the night after that. ''(Cut to Stan with the lever and a screwdriver)'' I tried for weeks to turn that dumb machine back on. But without the other two journals ''(The machine emits a few sparks, then dies)'' it was hopeless. ''(Cut to Stan walking down the street)'' Finally I ran out of food. I had no choice but to go into town. ''(Walks into the [[Dusk 2 Dawn]]; cut to him with a loaf of bread at the cash register)''
|-
![[Ma and Pa Duskerton|Ma]]
|Just the bread, then, there, stranger? That'll be 99 cents.
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks into his pockets and pulls out a packet of sugar, a paper clip and a peso)''
|-
![[Lazy Susan|Susan]]
|Hey, that's no stranger. That must be the mysterious science guy that lives in the woods!
|-
!
|''A crowd gathers.''
|-
!Stan
|''(In flashback)'' Uh, n-no, no. You've got the wrong guy. ''(Pulls his hood tighter)''
|-
![[Toby Determined]]
|I've heard strange stories about that old shack.
|-
![[Sheriff Blubs|Daryl Blubs]]
|Yeah! Mysterious lights and spooky experiments.
|-
!Pa
|Gosh, I'd pay anything to see what kind of shenanigans you get up to in there.
|-
!Susan
|Oh, me too! Do you ever give any tours?
|-
!Stan
|No. Really I- ''(Looks at hand, then sighs)'' Yes, I ''do'' give tours! Ten... nah-no... fifteen bucks a person!
|-
!
|''Crowd cheers and holds up money.''
|-
!Susan
|Sir! What did you say your name was, you man of mystery?
|-
!Stan
|Oh, uh, Stan...ford. Stanford Pines. ''(Cut to Stan leading a tour into the house)'' Step right up, folks, uh, to a world of... enchantment, or whatever. ''(With a box with a dial and two antennae on it)'' Behold, the um, nerdy science box.
|-
!Susan
|''(Looks at it and it burns her eye)'' Ah! My eye!
|-
!Stan
|Uh, I can assure you, that is in no way permanent.
|-
!Susan
|I paid fifteen dollars for this!?
|-
!
|''Crowd begins muttering.''
|-
!Stan
|Uhh... ''(Grabs the skeleton and some clothing)'' You're lucky you weren't part of the last tour group, um, ''(Shows them the skeleton, which he has dressed as a tourist)'' they never made it out aliiiivve. Heheh. Right?
|-
!
|''The crowd laughs.''
|-
!Susan
|That's funny.
|-
!Stan
|''(Montage of Stan putting up signs, making attractions, selling merchandise. Voice-over from the present)'' So I came up with a plan. I couldn't leave my brother's house until I figured out how to save him, but I needed to pay his mortgage somehow. For once in my life, people were actually buying what I was selling. And so the Murder Hut was born! Later renamed the Mystery Shack. Finally I found something I was good at. For once being a liar and a cheat paid off. The old me was dead, and I'd faked a car crash to prove it. By day I was Stanford Pines: Mr. Mystery. But by night I was down in the basement, trying to bring the real Stanford back. ''(Cut to Stan seeing a tour out, then going into the [[Underground laboratory|basement]] and looking at the portal. Cut back to the present)'' I couldn't risk anyone learning the truth and sabotaging my mission, so I lied to everyone: the town, my family, your [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|parents]], even you kids.
|-
!Dipper
|So all this time you were just trying to save your brother. Grunkle Stan, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.
|-
!Stan
|That's okay, kid. I probably wouldn't have believed me either.
|-
!Agent
|''(From upstairs)'' I heard talking! It was coming from downstairs!
|-
!Stan
|Oh no, it's too late, the agents are comin' for us!
|-
!Mabel
|What do we do?!
|-
!Soos
|Aw, man. I was so spellbound by your dramatic tale I forgot all about those dudes.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, forget. That's it! I think I know a way we might be able to defeat those agents! ''(Takes a [[Memory erasing gun]] out of a bag and gives it to Stanford)''
|-
!Ford
|Of course! I don't know how you got a hold of one of these but, this is perfect! If I can just amplify the signal to a radio headset frequency... ''(Plugs some wires into the gun and looks through some viewing glasses to see the agents running into the shack)'' There. Now everyone PLUG YOUR EARS! GET DOWN! NOW!
|-
!
|''Everyone crouches and plugs their ears. Cut to Agent Powers and Trigger at the doorway.''
|-
![[Agent Trigger]]
|Sir! Looks like there's a hidden door behind the [[vending machine]]!
|-
!Powers
|Excellent! Get me Washington on Line 1! I've been practicing sounds of excitement for this very occasion. Hey, do you hear that?
|-
!
|''A wave pulses through the shack and yard.''
|-
!Powers
|What? Where am I? Why am I standing in front of some sort of goofy fun knick-knack house?
|-
!Ford
|''(Comes to the porch)'' Stand down, gentlemen! I've been sent with the latest intel from Washington. ''(flipping through some of Mabel's drawings)'' According to this very real report, the power surges in Gravity Falls were actually due to radiation from an unreported meteor shower. A total embarrassment for your whole department. Luckily I'm here to take this mess off your hands, but I'll need of all your... floppy disks, and 8-tracks...right?
|-
!Powers
|Uh, everything about this case is contained on this drive.
|-
!Trigger
|''(Hands Ford a flash drive labeled "PINES")''
|-
!Ford
|Well, what are you waiting for, a kiss on the cheek? Get out of here before I have your butts court-martialed!
|-
!Powers
|Uhh, yes sir. Apologies, sir. ''(whistles)'' False alarm, everyone! ''(Trips on his way back to the [[Government vehicle|car]])''
|-
!
|''The government agents all leave. Ford gives [[Gompers]] the flash drive, and the goat runs away with it in his mouth.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs out with Dipper)'' Great uncle Stanford, that was amazing!
|-
!Stan
|''(Follows with Soos)'' Let's not go crazy; it was serviceable.
|-
!Ford
|''(Chuckles)'' Thank you, kids, but please, call me Ford.
|-
!Dipper
|Sure! Thanks, Great Uncle Ford. So, uh, ''(Holds up a pen and notepad and clicks pen excitedly)'' would you mind if I ask you a couple billion questions about Gravity Falls?
|-
!Ford
|Um, well I-uh...
|-
!Stan
|All right, kids, it's been a long day and me and my brother have a lot to talk about. Why don't you hit the hay, huh?
|-
!Dipper
|But, it's the author! ''(Clicks pen rapidly)'' I've been waiting so long to ask questions about-
|-
!Stan
|''(Grabs Dipper and Mabel's heads and pushes them away)'' I said. Hit. The hay!
|-
!Soos
|I'll just... let myself out. ''(Sidesteps away, and when he's out of sight the beeping of a phone can be heard; Offscreen)'' Wendy, I've got something amazing to tell you. Clear the next fourteen hours!
|-
!
|''Cut to night. Stan and Ford are looking at themselves in the mirror.''
|-
!Stan
|Look at us. When did we become old men?
|-
!Ford
|You look like Dad.
|-
!Stan
|Ugh, uck, don't ''say'' that.
|-
!Ford and Stan
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Sighs)'' Okay, Stanley, here's the deal. You can stay here the rest of the summer to watch the kids. I'll stay down in the basement and try to [[Interdimensional rift|contain any remaining damage]]. But when the summer's over, you give me my house back, you give me my ''name'' back, and this Mystery Shack junk is over forever. You got it?
|-
!Stan
|You really aren't gonna thank me, are you? ''(Beat)'' Fine. On one condition: you stay away from the kids; I don't want them in danger. Cause as far as I'm concerned, they're the only family I have left. ''(Walks upstairs, stops, starts to look back, then keeps walking)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel in their room. Mabel is standing by the door.''
|-
!Mabel
|Did you hear what they said? I think Grunkle Ford said they're gonna buy us puppies made of ice cream. Might be wishful thinking, though.
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know if this is good or bad. I wanted to meet the author, but...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sits on her bed)'' Yeah. I liked the way things were here before. Just us and Stan and the occasional goblin-monster.
|-
!Dipper
|Eh, I'm sure they'll work things out.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, you don't think we'll turn out like Stan and Ford, do you?
|-
!Dipper
|Well. What do you mean?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Lays down)'' I mean, they used to be best friends, but then they got all stupid. Can you promise me you won't get stupid?
|-
!Dipper
|I'm not stupider than you, dum-dum.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs)'' Good night, stupid.
|-
!Dipper
|Good night, stupid. ''(Turns light off and closes eyes)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looks up nervously)''
|-
!
|''End credits: Wendy is sitting up in her bed at 3 in the morning with Soos on the phone.''
|-
!Soos
|Okay, okay, so it turns out that the second Stan, the Stan that, we know, was actually, Stanley but the first Stan, was Stanford, but we didn't know, until, that Stanford came out of the portal, which was built by Stanford, but then Stanley pretended to be Stanford, he, did the portal, cause he's Stan, but he's ''not'' Stan.
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|Soos, it's three in the morning.
|-
!Soos
|Okay, okay, I understand. Anyway, act two: Stan started...

|But, Grunkle Stan, all summer long I've wanted to know who the author of the journal was. Now the guy lives in our basement and I can't even talk to him.

!Stan
|Huha, yeah! Quack quack, quack quack...
|-
!Dipper
|''(As Stan and Mabel say "quack," looks at light coming from behind the vending machine)''
|-
!Mabel
|Quack quack quack, a quack quack quaaaacck. Quuaaaaa... ''(Pointing at Dipper)'' Why isn't he quacking?
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Cut to Mabel writing in the living room.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(writing)'' Dear [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|Mom and Dad]], we've been in [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] for a few months and so much has happened! Just yesterday gravity reversed itself, almost destroying the universe and ''totally'' wrecking the whole town! ''(Looks up at TV, where [[Lazy Susan]] is standing in front of a crane attempting to pick up [[Greasy's Diner]])''
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Well, they say it was an earthquake, but you know what I think? I think I'm gonna have to start serving pineapple right-side up cake! Haha! Am I right? ''Am'' I right? ''(Greasy's Diner falls down from the crane)''

|-
!
|''Cut to [[Mayor Befufftlefumpter]] on a stage in front of the town.''
|-
!Mayor Befufftlefumpter
|Let the rebuilding of the town begin! Wrecking ball, start wrecking things! Hahaha! ''(A wrecking ball destroys a radio tower, making the television losing the signal)''
|-
!Mabel
|But the coolest part of the summer was when Grunkle Stan's twin brother came out of this [[Interdimensional Portal|portal-thingy]]. Now we have ''two'' grunkles for the price of one! And they are ''adorable'' together! ''(Stops writing, takes the picture of Stan and Ford holding hands she has drawn on the letter and folds them together; high voice:)'' We love each other so much! ''(makes kissing noises)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs in with a box)'' Mabel! You'll never guess what I found at the store today!
|-
!Mabel
|Dogs! Dogs with hats!
|-
!Dipper
|No, it's my favorite fantasy-talking, level-counting, statistics and graph paper-involving game of all time: ''(Holds it up)'' [[Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons (board game)|Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons!]] You wanna play it with me?
|-
!Mabel
|Well, I do like [[unicorns]], and that [[Hot Elf|hot elf]] looks promising. How do you play?
|-
!Dipper
|The rules are simple. ''(Opens game book)'' First, you roll a 38-sided die to determine the level of each player's statistical analysis poweroid. These orbs relate directly to the amount of quadrants that your team has dominion over, which is ''inverse'' to the anti-quadrants in your quadrant satchel.
|-
!Mabel
|And ''then'' we ride unicorns?
|-
!Dipper
|Yes!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Dipper
|And no.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Frowns)''
|-
!Dipper
|First, we make a graph. ''(Holds up graph paper)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sighs)'' This is like Homework: The Game.
|-
!Dipper
|Come on, Mabel, I need at least two people to play.
|-
![[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]
|''(Walks in)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, wow, would you look at that: two people! ''(Backs out'')
|-
!Dipper
|Huh. Hey, Soos, up for a little game of D&D&MoreD?
|-
!Soos
|Aw, sorry, Dipper, I don't go in for that pen and paper kind of stuff. I'm more of an FCLORPer.
|-
!Dipper
|A wha-?
|-
!Soos
|FCLORP: ''(Holds up wristband with "FCLORP" written on it)'' Foam and Cardboard Legitimate Outdoor Role Play. It is where a passionate brethren of craftsman, bring their dreams to magical reality. ''(Cut to him, [[Toby Determined]], [[Sheriff Blubs]] and [[Deputy Durland]] in the yard with cardboard costumes on)'' Let yon priestess go, elf-mage!
|-
!Toby
|Never, Paladin Radmaster! ''(Throwing balls at Soos)'' Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!
|-
!Durland
|I'm a fortress!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, thanks anyway, Soos.
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks in)'' Say, is this that game that's mostly math and writing and isn't anything like the picture on the box?
|-
!Dipper
|Yes! It is! You wanna play with me, Grunkle Stan?
|-
!Stan
|Ha! Look, kid, I prefer to do my dice rolling in Vegas. Besides, only a game designed by nerds would have "charisma" as a fantasy power. Heh. Check this out: ''(Reading from book:)'' When facing yon adversaries, shield thyself, under an elfin buttress.
|-
!Mabel
|Haha, say it again!
|-
!Stan
|Buttress.
|-
!Stan and Mabel
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey! ''(Takes the book from Stan)'' Laugh all you want. You guys just aren't smart enough to understand it.
|-
!Soos
|Heheh. Sorry, dude, but it is kinda nerdy. Well, I'm off to lay siege to a goblin fortress. ''(Puts on cardboard helmet and takes cardboard sword)'' To [[Abuelita|my grandma's]] backYARD! ''(Runs out)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(sighs, Cut to him in the backyard with [[Gompers]] with the game set up. He rolls the dice)'' Oh, nice! You rolled a seventeen!
|-
!Gompers
|''(Bleats)''
|-
!Dipper
|Aaannd this is sad. Maybe I should start obsessing over [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] again.
|-
!Gompers
|''(Takes the dice)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Grabs it and tries to pull it out of Gompers' mouth)'' Hey, give it back! Come on, Gompers, let go! ''(Pulls it out and falls backward, dropping the die under the porch on front of a hole)'' Aw, man, my 38-sided die! ''(Crawls under the porch and the ground falls out from underneath him)'' Whoa, what AAAAAHHHH!!! ''(Lands on the floor of the basement; looks up to see the die next to the cycloptopus, picks it up)''
|-
!Ford
|Dipper! Stop!
|-
!Dipper
|Great uncle Ford!
|-
!Ford
|What did I say about coming down here? My work is far too dangerous for a single living soul to spend even one second i- wait! Is that a 38-sided die from Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons?!
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah! Y-you ''know'' that game?
|-
!Ford
|With pen and paper, shield and sword...
|-
!Dipper and Ford
|Our quest shall be our sweet reward! ''(Laugh)''
|-
!Ford
|This is my favorite game in the whole multiverse! I can't believe they still make it!
|-
!Dipper
|They do! And I've been looking all day for someone to play it with me!
|-
!Ford
|My boy, do you know what this means? We must stop everything I've been working on at once... and PLAY!
|-
!Cycloptopus
|''(Grabs Ford's face)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Pulls it off; his face is covered in welts)'' That's... going to leave a mark.
|-
!
|''Commercial break. Cut to Mabel and Stan in the kitchen.''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay. We've got everything we need to watch the season finale of Duck-tective tomorrow. ''(Holds up a box full of food with a ramp)'' I even made mouth-ramps so we can pour food into our mouths without taking our eyes off the screen. ''(Pours some food into her mouth)'' Nom nom nom.
|-
!Stan
|''(Stapling a turkey head to a beaver's body)'' And I recreated the main character out of some spare taxidermy parts. ''(Imitating Duck-tective:)'' Quack quack. I'm the duck detective! Who stole my breadloaf?
|-
!Mabel
|Hahaha! That is so messed up! Dipper would LOVE that!
|-
!Stan
|Heh. Yeah. Where is the little squirt anyway? I haven't seen him all afternoon.
|-
!
|''Cut to the basement.''
|-
!Ford
|''(Moving the dice around his fingers)'' Alright. You've entered the chamber. Princess Unatainabelle beckons you. But WAIT! IT'S A TRAP!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Ford
|An illusion cast by [[Probabilitor the Annoying]].
|-
!Dipper
|You know his weakness, right?
|-
!Dipper and Ford
|Prime-statistical anomalies over 37 but not exceeding 51! ''(Roll the dice)''
|-
!Dipper
|Yes! Uh! In your face, you cardboard wizard!
|-
!Ford
|''(Holds up the picture of Probabilitor)'' Hm. The old boy looks a bit different than he did back in my day.
|-
!Dipper
|Mmm, yeah, they change the art every few years. Thankfully you missed the period when the creators of the game tried to make it "''cooler.''"
|-
!
|''Cut to an old commercial. Some teens spray paint over an advertisement for Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons.''
|-
!Teen
|Man, this game is ''boring''.
|-
!
|''The wall explodes and Probabilitor, wearing colorful clothing, appears.''
|-
!Probabilitor
|You dare challenge Probabilitizle!?
|-
!Voice over
|''(Rapping:)'' I flip the cap back, and roll the dice. Don't step to the wizard cause the wizard don't...
|-
!
|''The words "Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons" appears, then is crossed out and replaced by "[[Diggity Dungeons & All That]]."''
|-
!Voice over
|Diggity Dungeons and All That! Updated for the nine double deuce! Available wherever dope games are sold!
|-
!Probabilitizle
|Peace! ''(makes peace sign)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to the present.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(shivers)'' Must have been dark times, those 90's.
|-
!Ford
|Yeesh. Sounds like a good time to be stuck between dimensions.
|-
!Dipper
|Great uncle Ford, I've been meaning to ask you: where were you before you came out of that machine, and what have you been doing down here? Are you working on something behind that curtain?
|-
!Ford
|Dipper, it's best if you and the family stay away from that subject. Honestly, I'm not sure any of you could handle the real answer.
|-
!Dipper
|But, but I can handle it-
|-
!Ford
|Ah-ah! But I can show you something I brought back with me: ''(Dumps out the contents of his bag and opens a box)'' An [[infinity sided die|infinity-sided die]].
|-
!Dipper
|Woah... that's ''so'' cool. And... impossible!
|-
!Ford
|These things are outlawed in 9,000 dimensions. You wanna know why? Look at those symbols. Infinite sides means infinite outcomes. If I rolled it, anything could happen. Our faces could melt into jelly. The world could turn into an egg. Or you could just roll an eight. Who knows. That's why I have to keep it in this protective cheap plastic case. Now, back to the game! You've got Probabilitor on the ropes.
|-
!
|''Cut to the attic at night. Mabel is trying to sleep while Dipper is writing on graph paper on the floor.''
|-
!Dipper
|Hohoho man. And then, if I had a dragon here, and then a plus three fire mode-
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, are you going to go to sleep? You've been saying dork words for hours.
|-
!Dipper
|Sorry, Mabel, I ''got'' to finish this dungeon. It's going to ''totally'' stump Great uncle Ford tomorrow, I can't wait to see the look on his face.
|-
!Mabel
|You're uh, spending a lot of time with old Fordsy lately, huh?
|-
!Dipper
|You have no idea. I knew the author must be cool, but he's better than I imagined. And, he doesn't make fun of me all the time, like you and Grunkle Stan do.
|-
!Mabel
|Give 'im time, haha! Heyooo! ''(Pause)'' Nah, you got me. ''(Lays down; to herself:)'' You got me.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Grenda at the doorway the next day.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Puts on a Duck-tective sweater, to Grenda:)'' Thanks for coming over to watch tonight's Duck-tective finale, Grenda!
|-
![[Grenda]]
|Of course! I'm so invested in the lives of these characters!
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Stan, who comes down the stairs wearing a suit:)'' Hey-hey, look at you! Someone's all dressed up.
|-
!Stan
|It's a big night. I think we all remember where we were, when we learned Duck-tective was shot.
|-
!
|''An alarm goes off.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gasps)'' Viewing positions, everyone!
|-
!Grenda, Mabel and Stan
|''(Run to the living room, but stop and gasp when they see that Dipper and Ford have laid their game all over it)''
|-
!Grenda
|Ah! Graph paper! ''(Stomping on it)'' Kill it! Kill it!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper, could you maybe move this to another room?
|-
!Ford
|No dice! We ran out of room in the basement and we're going for a world record! Now, dice! ''(rolls a 32)'' 32, yes! 7,000 points damage!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Laughing)'' You got me!
|-
!Stan
|Oh, why, why with this? You wanna break a record, Ford? You already got it with world's nerdiest old man.
|-
!Ford
|Hey, at least I'm not all keyed up to watch a kid's show.
|-
!Stan
|I'll have you know that Duck-tective has a big mystery element! And a lot of humor that goes over kids' heads!
|-
!Grenda
|I don't get a lot of it, but I like animals in human situations.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, it starts in a few minutes!
|-
!Stan
|''(Moves to take the paper off the TV)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Grabs his hand)'' Move that and pay the price!
|-
!Stan
|Oh, what, fifty magical dwarf dollars?
|-
!Ford
|Don't mock our fantastical monetary system!
|-
!Stan
|I'll mock all I want, it's my TV room!
|-
!Ford
|It's my ''house'', you... ''(sighs)'' Listen, Stanley, did it ever occur to you to if you joined us you might actually have fun?
|-
!Stan
|What? Now you listen to me! ''(Takes Ford's bag)'' As long as I live I will never...
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, wait!
|-
!Stan
|ever...
|-
!Ford
|Stanley!
|-
!Stan
|Play your smartypants nerd game! ''(throws the bag to the floor, and the infinity sided dice rolls out)''
|-
!Ford
|No!
|-
!
|''Four Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons characters appear.''
|-
!Probabilitor
|Mortals of dimension 46'\, kneel before me and ''(rolls dice)'' snivel! I am Probabilitor! The greatest wizard in all of mathology! Give or take an error of 0.4.
|-
!Stan
|Eh, is this normal?
|-
!Dipper
|Have you come to send us on the quest of a lifetime because we're the smartest players you've ever met?
|-
!Probabilitor
|You ''are'' the smartest players I've ever met! That's why I'm going to eat your brains to gain your intelligence. It's what I do.
|-
![[Ogres|Ogre]]
|It's his thing.
|-
!Dipper
|What?!
|-
!Probabilitor
|Seize them!
|-
!Ford
|''(Takes out a gun)'' Your math is no match for my gun, you idiot!
|-
!Probabilitor
|Math ray! ''(Shoots a hole through the wall)'' I'm not here to play games! ''(Grabs Ford and Dipper and flies out, followed by the other characters)'' Now to the forest, for the ultimate game!
|-
!Grenda
|So, the room's free now. Who wants to watch Duck-tective? ''(Squeaks Duck-tective toy)'' Nobody? More couch for Grenda!
|-
!
|''Commercial break.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh no! That crazy wizard is going to eat our brothers' brains! We have to stop 'em!
|-
!Stan
|Eh, maybe let 'em get a couple bites in Ford's brain first. Even things out smartness-wise.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|Alright, alright. I guess if we have no other choice, we'll go on a... (''Sighs) ''epic wizard quest.
|-
!Mabel and Grenda
|YAAAAYY!!
|-
!Stan
|Everyone grab a weapon.
|-
!
|''Stan finds a bat in the couch cushion, Mabel takes a rake, and Grenda lifts up a chair.''
|-
!Grenda
|Heh. Nice!
|-
!Mabel
|We're coming for you, Dipper! And Great uncle Ford! And possibly that hot elf, if he's got anything to do with this.
|-
!
|''They run off into the forest. Cut to Probability with Dipper and Ford, who are tied to a tree.''
|-
!Probabilitor
|Heheheh. ''(Measures the Pines' heads)'' With each brain I eat, I shall increase my enchantelligence.
|-
!Ford
|If my hands were free, I'd break every part of your face.
|-
!Probabilitor
|The time has come! Hot elf! Ready the brain-cooking pot!
|-
!Hot elf
|''(Sighs)'' Yes, Probabilitor. ''(Shakes his hair and shoots a flaming arrow at the pot)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Grenda, Mabel, and Stan walking through the forest.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Slaps his back)'' We must be getting close. These fairy bites are getting more frequent.
|-
![[Fairies|Fairy]]
|''(Crushed against Stan's suit)'' Hey, look, listen.
|-
!Ogre
|''(Stomps in front of them)'' Halt! Yon interlopers are trespassing on the ancient forest of Probabilitor the wizard! If ye wish to pass, first, ye must complete seven unworldly quest, each, more difficult than the--
|-
!Grenda
|NOW! ''(Hits him on the head with the chair and he collapses)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pokes his foot with the rake)'' Is he... dead?
|-
!Stan
|He's magic, sweetie. I'm sure he's fine. ''(To Grenda:)'' There's no cops in the forest. We take this to our graves. ''(Exchanges winks with her)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to Probabilitor.''
|-
!Probabilitor
|Heheheheh.
|-
!Dipper
|What do we do? What do we do?
|-
!Ford
|Stop thinking, Dipper! The more wrinkly your brain gets, the more he'll want to eat it!
|-
!Probabilitor
|And now, a little math problem: when I subtract your brain from your skulls ''(Hits Ford and Dipper with his staff)'', add salt, and divide your family, what's the remainder?
|-
!Mabel
|''(From behind the bushes) ''YOUR BUTT!!
|-
!Probabilitor
|What? My butt isn't part of this particular equation.
|-
!Grenda, Mabel and Stan
|''(Jump out of the bushes'')
|-
!Probabilitor
|Drat! How did you make it past my one guard? Very well. There's only one way your family can save you. YOU must defeat ME in Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons: REAL LIFE EDITION! ''(Creates a gameboard)'' Hahaha-hahaha!
|-
!Stan
|What? Oh, come on!
|-
!Probabilitor
|I choose my characters...''(Two ogres appear in the game)'' vs... ''(Dipper and Ford appear as elf characters in his hand) ''yours...
|-
!Ford
|Ah! My ears! They're so pointy!
|-
!Dipper
|There better be something protective under this tunic. ''(Turns around and opens tunic)'' ''Oh'', no, there isn't!
|-
!Stan
|Seriously, can't we just, like, arm wrestle or something?
|-
!Probabilitor
|Come on, this game is a lot of fun. I had my mom pack me a lunch. ''(Takes some apple slices out of a paper bag)'' Ew, apple slices? I'll eat ''you'' last.
|-
!Stan
|Uh, just make with the rules, ugly. ''(Chews gum)''
|-
!Probabilitor
|The game is a battle royale. We help our characters by casting spells determined by rolls of the dice. If you win, I'll go back to my own dimension.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Claps)''
|-
!Probabilitor
|But if I win, I eat their brains.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, I'm not sure this is such a good--
|-
!Stan
|DEAL!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh boy.
|-
!Probabilitor
|Let the game... BEGIN! ''(Rolls a 13)'' Attack! ''(The ogres try to hammer Dipper and Ford with their clubs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Running away)'' Ah! Whoa!
|-
!Ford
|Ah!
|-
!Stan
|What do we do? What are our moves?!
|-
!Dipper
|There are no moves; you make them up!
|-
!Stan
|What? Really?
|-
!Ford
|Yes! I tried to tell you: this game involves math, but also risk, and imagination!
|-
!Stan
|Risk?
|-
!Mabel
|Imagination? Grunkle Stan, make something up! It's just like lying!
|-
!Stan
|I cast, uh... shield of... shielding! ''(Rolls a 14 and a shield appears in front of Dipper and Ford)'' Ha! We're doing it!
|-
!Probabilitor
|Shield of Shielding Reversal Spell. ''(Rolls dice and the shield disappears)''
|-
!Mabel
|I cast: Giggle Time Bouncy Boots! ''(Rolls dice and boots with springs appear on Dipper and Ford)''
|-
!Dipper and Ford
|''(Jump over the ogres)''
|-
!Mabel
|Hot flamey sword! ''(A sword appears in Dipper's hands)'' Super hot flamey sword! ''(The sword gets longer)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Jumps over an ogre and kills it with the sword)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Kills the other ogre with a sword)''
|-
!Probabilitor
|No! Drat you! You'll never outrun my ''(Rolls dice)'' Ogre-nado! ''(An ogre-nado chases Dipper and Ford)'' It is what is sounds like! ''(The ogre-nado blows Dipper's and Ford's swords away)''
|-
!Mabel
|I cast: CENTAURTAUR! YAH! ''(Rolls the dice and a horse with another horse body for a head appears)''
|-
!Stan
|Mabel, I am so confused and ''so'' proud right now.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Ford get on the centaurtaur and it runs away from the ogre-nado.''
|-
!Mabel
|Go go go, Dipper go! You can do it!
|-
!Stan
|''(Simultaneously:)'' Come on, you guys! Go! Go!
|-
!
|''The centaurtaur runs into a smaller room and disappears. The ogre-nado tries to follow but falls apart.''
|-
!Mabel
|Yeaahh!
|-
!Stan
|Yes!
|-
!Probabilitor
|''(The [[Impossibeast]] picks up Dipper and Ford)'' Hahaha yes! I was saving the worst for last!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no!
|-
!Ford
|The Impossibeast! Hey, I thought they banned this character!
|-
!Probabilitor
|Think again! I'm playing the controversial 1991-1992 edition! ''(The Impossibeast slams Dipper and Ford against the wall)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shaking die)'' I'll think of some weapons!
|-
!Ford
|You don't understand. This is the most powerful monster in the game! He can only be defeated by rolling a perfect 38! But the odds of that are--
|-
!Stan
|''(Takes the die from Mabel and shakes it)'' Hey, long odds are what you want when you're a world class gambler! Alright, Stan, you can do this... Papa needs a new pair of... TWINS! ''(throws the die and it lands on 38)''
|-
!Probabilitor
|NOOO!
|-
!Stan
|Sorry, nerd-wizard. All your smarts are no match for dumb luck.
|-
!Mabel
|I cast DEATH MUFFINS! ''(Muffins with dynamite sticking out of them appear in Dipper and Ford's hands)''
|-
!Dipper and Ford
|''(Throws the death muffins into the Impossibeast's mouth)''
|-
!Impossibeast
|Huh? ''(Explodes in muffins)''
|-
!Stan
|Yes!
|-
!Mabel
|Yeeaah!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Ford, holding muffins, appear next to them in their normal clothes.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hugs Dipper)'' Hahaha!
|-
!Hot elf
|''(With Grenda hugging him, closes the rule book)'' The game is, like, over. Excelci-whatever.
|-
!Probabilitor
|''(Disappearing with the game)'' No! I'm returning to my own realm! I'm turning into pure math! What are the ooooodddsss?? ''(Disappears)''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, that was amazing! How did you know you'd win?
|-
!Stan
|Hey, a gambler never reveals his secrets. ''(Picks up the die, which has gum stuck to the bottom and starts chewing some new gum)''
|-
!Mabel
|Man! That ''was'' fun for ages 8 to 80! Or a million or however old you guys are!
|-
!Stan
|''(To Dipper:)'' Y'know, I'm sorry for making fun of your game, kiddo. Sure, it might be too nerdy for me, bust it's just the right amount of nerdy for you and my brother. If you two wanna hang out sometimes, I won't get in your way.
|-
!Dipper
|Actually, after all that, I could use a little mindless fun.
|-
!Grenda
|Guys! We can watch the second showing of Duck-tective! It's not too late! ''(Squeaks Duck-tective toy)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Grenda, Stan and Soos in the living room at night watching Duck-tective.''
|-
!Duck-tective
|''(On TV, on a hospital bed)'' Wah, wah-wah. Wah, wah-wah. ''(Subtitled:)'' I'm going to that big pond in the sky.
|-
!Constable
|I just don't understand who shot you. The only person clever enough to defeat Duck-tective is-- ''(Gasps)'' Duck-tective!
|-
!Duck-tective's brother
|''(Throws a bedpan at Constable's head, knocking him out)'' Wa wa-wa-wa-wa... WA-WA-WA! ''(Subtitled:)'' Time to finish the job... TWIN BROTHER!
|-
!Duck-tective
|''(TERRIFIED QUACK)''
|-
!Mabel
|He had a twin brother all along? ''(Pouring chips on Stan) That's'' the big twist we've been waiting for!?
|-
!Grenda
|WHAT A RIP-OFF!
|-
!Soos
|I predicted that, like, a year ago.
|-
!
|''Cut to the basement.''
|-
!Ford
|''(Locks the infinity-sided die away; to Dipper:)'' This'll be here if you ever need it.
|-
!Dipper
|Really? Even though I got us into the whole game-playing mess?
|-
!Ford
|Eh, we both got carried away. I guess we'd both gone for awhile without a friend. Dipper, can I tell you something?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Nods)''
|-
!Ford
|You asked me earlier what I was working on. Well, ''(pulls curtain down to reveal the portal is gone)'' I dismantled the [[Universe portal|portal]]. An interdimensional gateway is too dangerous for the world it feeds into. That's why I was mad at Stan for using it. He saved me but, as I feared, the instability of the machine created this: ''(Holds up a transparent sphere with a blob in it)'' an [[interdimensional rift]]. I've contained it for now, but it's incredibly dangerous. Dipper, I don't want you to tell anyone about this. Not Stan, not even your sister. You understand?
|-
!Dipper
|Oh-uh, of course.
|-
!Ford
|In my time I've made many powerful enemies, but I ''trust'' you with this secret. Now get yourself to bed. I have much research to do.
|-
!Dipper
|Goodnight, Great uncle Ford.
|-
!Ford
|Goodnight, Dipper. ''(Puts the rift away)''

!Durland
|Guys, do you ever think that maybe we're doin' this 'cause our lives aren't special enough? That we use fantasy as an escape to avoid the self-improvement we all need? That maybe we should just go out and grow as people?

|-

Stan Pines
| Alright Stan, another day, another random body pain. Here we go. ''(Puts on slippers that are soaked in milk)'' Ugh!
|-
!
|''Finds a note on his desk that reads:'' "Dear Stan, I need something to carry milk in so I used your slippers. Love, [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]." ''Stan shudders and walks into the kitchen and tries to turn on a light but the light bulb bursts. He groans and goes to find a new light bulb but finds that the box is empty except for a note that reads:'' "Dear Stan, I took these to build a planetarium suit for [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]! Sorry! [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]]." ''Stan grumbles and crumples the note.''

|''Cut to Stan waiting in line in a [[Tons grocery store|grocery store]] at the checkout counter with light bulbs. [[Robbie Valentino|Robbie]], [[Lee]], [[Tambry]] and [[Nate]] show up behind him.''
|-

Lee
|Whoa, let's not take this line. There's an old person in it.
|-
!
Robbie Valentino
|Psh, yeah. He's probably gonna pay with like, pennies and, war bonds.

Stan
|Hey! For your information, I was gonna shoplift most of this.

|-
!Stan
|Ugh. Rough start to a day. ''(Walks towards the kitchen)'' But it's all gonna be worth it when I fix that light bul — ''(Stan walks in to see [[Ford Pines|Ford]] screwing in a light bulb with Dipper, Mabel, and Soos)''
|-
!Ford Pines
|And... we're... done!
|-
!Dipper, Mabel and Soos
|''(Cheer)''
|-
!Mabel
|Does anyone see this? This is what a hero looks like right here.
|-
!Stan
|I thought we were out of light bulbs.
|-
!Ford
|Oh we were, so I invented my own! It will last a thousand years and the light it emits makes your skin softer.
|-
!Dipper, Mabel and Soos
|''(Rubbing their skin)'' Oooh!
|-
!
Soos
|Never have I known such softness!
|-
!Ford
|Anyway, where were you?
|-
!Stan
|''(Drops new light bulbs in the trash; goes to the TV and picks up the remote)'' Well, TV at least you appreciate me. Give me the good news. ''(Turns on the TV)''
|-
![[Shandra Jimenez]]
|''(On the TV)'' This just in, the [[Mayor Befufftlefumpter|mayor]] is dead.
|-
!Stan
|What?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks in with Mabel)'' Whoa, what's going on?
|-
!Shandra
|''(On TV)'' Raised by bears in the wilderness, Mayor Eustace Huckabone Befufftlefumpter was best known for raising the [[Gravity Falls water tower|water tower]], possible starting World War I, and putting town menace [[Gideon Gleeful]] behind bars, in actual adult [[Gravity Falls Maximum Security Prison|prison]]. A memorial statue is already being carved in the deceased mayor's honor. ''(Cries while her co-host comforts her)'' I'm sorry. It's just been so long since we've had real news. I'm just so happy! ''(Keeps crying)''
|-
!
[[Unnamed news anchor|Shandra's co-host]]
|''(On TV)'' There will be a town hall meeting this afternoon to discuss replacing him.
|-
!
Stan
|New mayor huh? Wonder who it could be... ''(Sees his reflection in the TV)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!
|''Cut to all the citizens of [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] in the [[Town Hall]].''
|-
!
[[Sheriff Blubs]]
|Alright. Order! Order everyone! Calm down now! We're here to choose a mayor for the first time in almost a century. According to the town charter, ''(unrolls an old scroll as a bat flies out of it)'' a worthy candidate is defined as anyone who can cast a shadow, count to ten, and throw their hat into the provided ring. ''([[Deputy Durland]] brings out a hoop and places it on the floor; [[Bud Gleeful]] immediately throws his hat in it)''
|-
!
Bud
|Well now I do believe I fulfill all the requirements.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, Bud Gleeful?
|-
!Mabel
|He looks good! Considering we threw his son in jail.
|-
!Stan
|''(Sitting back) ''That was a good day.
|-
!Bud
|Now folks, I know our families had its fair shares of whoopsie daisies in the past, but I'd like to make up for it by formally announcing my candidacy for the mayor of Gravity Falls! Any questions?
|-
![[Toby Determined]]
|Yes, are you still in contact with Lil' Gideon?
|-
!Bud
|That's a great question, I'm giving you 50% off a used car.
|-
!Toby
|Fifty percent?! FIFTY PERCENT?!!! ''(Rips his notepad in half)''
|-
!Bud
|In fact, everyone look under your seats. ''(Pointing at people in the crowd)'' ''You'' get half off a used car! ''You'' get half off a used car!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pulls out a car discount coupon from under her chair)'' Wow, a colorful piece of paper? He's got my vote!
|-
!Dipper
|Guys, I've got a really bad feeling about Bud Gleeful as mayor.
|-
!Soos
|I dunno, dude, it's not like we have a lot of good mayor options. Everyone in this town is a tad strange. Except, ironically, [[Tad Strange]].
|-
!Tad
|Hi guys, Tad's the name, and being normal's my game.
|-
!Mabel
|Loving you, Tad!
|-
!Tad
|''(Holds up a slice of bread)'' And I love bread!
|-
!Dipper
|It's a shame Ford isn't here, he'd run. And win! And be a great mayor!
|-
!Bud
|So since everyone's happy I'll just take the oath of office now, sound good, gavel up? ''(Stan throws his fez in the hoop, and everyone gasps)''
|-
!Stan
|Hold it right there Bud! I'm taking you on! ''(Everyone gasps)''
|-
!Bud
|Stanford? No ''o-''ffence but you're just some two-bit carnival barker. And your head is more ears than face!
|-
!Stan
|Oh yeah? Well your face is more fat... than... not fat! ''(Everyone gasps)''
|-
!Tad
|Oh snap!
|-
!Stan
|Whaddya say folks? Are we just gonna let Bud win? How about a real election!
|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|Get in there, cap! ''(Everyone throws their hats in)''
|-
!Bud
|Well, looks like we've got some competition here folks. Which I'm fine with, totally fine with! ''(Pulls Stan towards him and talks quietly)'' I was gonna let bygones be bygones Stan, but you just made a powerful enemy. I'll win either way, and when I do, you might not like the Gravity Falls you wake up in! ''(Punches out the Mystery Shack on a map of Gravity Falls hanging on the wall)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Townspeople
|Election! Election! Election!
|-
!Blubs
|Let the madness begin! ''(Fires cannon)''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, what are you doing?
|-
!Stan
|Running for mayor! Did I... did I not make that clear?
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, it's not that we think you can't do it, it's just —
|-
!Dipper
|No no, it's okay, Mabel. ''(Turns to Stan)'' We don't think you can do it.
|-
!Stan
|Look, kids. The mayor kicking the bucket got me thinking. I'm an old man, and I'm not getting any younger. My dumb brother's research is probably gonna make him famous. And what do I have to show for my life? Do I really want "crooked grifter" on my tombstone? How about, "crooked mayor"!
|-
!Dipper
|Psst, Mabel, let's talk. ''(Turns to Mabel)'' I know Stan isn't the best candidate. Heck, he's committing voter fraud right now. ''(Camera turns to show Stan, stuffing in votes into his own ballot box)'' But Bud's definitely up to something, and we're the only ones who can stop him.
|-
!Mabel
|You're right, Dipper. Besides, Stan has a kind-of charisma. How hard could getting him elected be? ''(Dipper takes off his pine tree cap and they both reach for matching hats and put on "Vote Stan" campaign stickers)''
|-
!
| ''Cut to the Mystery Shack, which now has a sign over "Mystery," reading "Mayorly Shack." There are several U.S. flags and "Vote Stan" signs all over. [[Waddles]] is with [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]], who has written on Waddles' body "SWINES 4 PINES" on one side and "BUD'S A DUD" on the other.''
|-
!Wendy
|Spread the word, pig! ''(Waddles runs off)''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright everybody, eyes up here! ''(Opens a rolled paper with a lot of dust coming out)'' Okay, Gravity Falls Elections are based on two events. The Wednesday Stump Speech, held on an actual... stump, and the Friday Debate wherein townsfolk throw birdseed at the candidate they like most. At the end, they release a freedom eagle who will fly to the candidate covered in more seed and bestow a birdly kiss upon him anointing him mayor. ''(Shows everybody the parchment, frowning; while rolling paper:)'' I couldn't make this up if I wanted to.
|-
!
|''Phone rings in the "Phone Bank."''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay Grunkle Stan, are you ready for your first radio interview?
|-
!Stan
|I got my mouth, don't I?
|-
!Mabel
|''(On the phone)'' Okay you're on with the candidate.
|-
!Voiceover
|You're listening to Falls Radio: 24 hour news and bear rampage alerts, and now here's the ''T-man.''
|-
!Toby
|''Hello!'' Candidate Stan first question: How do you feel about the American'' flag?''
|-
!Stan
|Meh, I can take it or leave it, too many stripes. Next question.
|-
!
|''Cut to people at [[Skull Fracture]] listening to the radio broadcast and grunting with doubt.''
|-
!Toby
|What would you do to help educate our kids?
|-
!Stan
|Ha, simple. Put them on an island and make them fight for dominance. ''(Cut to a family listening to the radio; woman covers her daughter's ears)'' Also teach kids swears. That'll bring them to the real world. ''(Cut to Mabel and Dipper, who look at each other worriedly)''
|-
!Toby
|What would you do about the crime in Gravity Falls?
|-
!Stan
|Wait, do you mean crime in general, or just the specific crimes committed by m —
|-
!Dipper
|''(The phone line is cut off when Dipper cuts it with scissors)'' Okay, interview's over. [[Candy]], what's the damage?
|-
!Candy
|Your approval ratings started at zero. Now it's a number lower than zero. ''(Flips laptop around and shows Stan's negative approval ratings)''
|-
!Wendy
|You're meme-ing fast, and none of them are good. ''(Shows her phone, which has a meme of Stan on it that says: One does not simply "teach kids swears")''
|-
!Mabel
|Look Grunkle Stan, people are like smell markers, and you're black licorice! It's not that you're un-sniffable, you just need to learn when to ''keep the cap on''.
|-
!Dipper
|From now on, maybe you should read our ''prepared'' remarks. ''(Holds up a folded piece of paper with "YOUR SPEECH" written on it with drawings by Mabel)''
|-
!Stan
|Heh heh. Sorry kids. I always say words that come out of my brain. If my head says, that lady's got an ugly baby, my mouth says, "whoa, lady, you got one ugly baby."
|-
!
|''(Dipper and Mabel look at each other worriedly; cut to [[Underground laboratory|basement]], where Dipper is pacing around)''
|-
!Dipper
|And he's insisting on speaking his mind!
|-
!Ford
|So this ''is'' an emergency.
|-
!Dipper
|The Stump Speech is in a couple of days, and if he continues like this, we'll lose to Bud for sure!
|-
!Ford
|Hmm. It's a shame there isn't some device that will allow you to control someone else. Oh. Wait. Of course, yes. There is. ''(Shows Dipper a striped [[Mind control ties|tie]])'' A long time ago I designed a prototype for Ronald Reagan's masters. Just get Stan to wear this, and you can make him a literal talking head.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Peers inside the tie)'' Whoa! This is amazing! And ethically ambiguous!
|-
!Ford
|''(Takes out another tie that is darker)'' As long as you wear the matching one, he'll say and do whatever you want him to.
|-
!Dipper
|(''Holds up both ties'') Thank you Great Uncle Ford! ''(Runs off)''
|-
!Ford
|Yes, yes. Use it responsibly and all.
|-
!
|''Cuts to the Mystery Shack, where Dipper and Mabel are testing out the ties.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Puts on the tie)'' Whoa, thanks for the slamming tie, dudes! These stripes are so slimming!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Turns to Dipper)'' You really think this mind-controlling tie is gonna work?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes out other tie)'' Flip the switch and test it out! ''(Mabel puts it on and flips the switch)''
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|''(Singing and dancing)'' Oh-oh-oh! I'm a dancing dude! I got some fancy moves and a bad attitude! ''(Mabel switches it off and Soos starts sweating and panting)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ha! That's amazing!
|-
!Soos
|Guys! Something weird just happened. I'm really freaked out! ''(Mabel flips the switch on again)''
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|I am Soos-Tron! Watch me eat this pine cone! ''(Mabel mimics eating a pine cone while Soos actually eats one, and Mabel then flips the switch off; Soos collapses onto his hands and knees, panting again)''
|-
!Mabel
|Mind control is awesome!
|-
!Soos
|''(Still panting)'' Oh my gosh! My life just flashed before my eyes! Aghh!
|-
!
|''Cut to Tyler giving a stump speech. A sign hangs across two trees saying: "General Mayoral Stumpston Speeches")''
|-
!Tyler
|Education, get it. Prosperity, get it. A Gravity Falls we can be proud of, get iiiiit! ''(Audience claps)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at tie)'' Ugh. Do I really have to wear this thing? It looks like a flag threw up on me.
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, just trust your lucky tie.
|-
!Blubs
|And now, Stanford Pines!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pushes Stan towards the stage)'' You're on, Grunkle Stan! ''(Slips on the mind control tie; turns to Dipper)'' Okay, we'll only jump in if he starts doing badly.
|-
!Stan
|''(Enters through the curtains)'' Hiya there! Stan Pines here. Let's get real. Do you think the women of Gravity Falls wear too much makeup?
|-
!Dipper
|Jump in! jump in!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Turns on the switch)''
|-
!Stan
|Uh, what I meant to say was: you ladies all look great. And have you done something with your hair? Girl, you are ''working it!'' ''(Snaps his fingers)''
|-
!Woman
|''(Nodding with approval)'' Yes!
|-
!Girl with Bow
|That is ''exactly'' what I needed to hear right now.
|-
!Stan
|Whew! ''(Wipes forehead)'' I'm Stan Pines. You may know me as the guy who accidentally let all those bees loose in that elementary school a few years back. ''(Dipper quickly pulls the tie off of Mabel and puts it on, gaining control of Stan)''
|-
!Stan
|But I believe in things. America. Freedom. Ameri-freedom!
|-
![[America guy]]
|Good! He's saying all the right things! ''(Eyes fill with tears; grabs the people beside him)''
|-
!Stan
|Like my opponent pointed out, I may not have a pretty face, but if you want a candidate that will listen to you, well, I'm proud to be all ears. ''(Crowd cheers; Mabel takes control of Stan)'' Now, watch me break it ''down!'' ''(Break dances then falls to the ground; the control goes off and Stan walks off stage, scratching his head in confusion)''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, that was amazing! ''(Hugs Stan)''
|-
!Soos
|Yeah! How'd you do it, Mr. Pines?
|-
!Stan
|Eh, I don't know. I just opened my mouth and spoke from the heart, or... gut, or something. And what is that sound? Why are people jamming their hands together?
|-
!Mabel
|It's applause! Grunkle Stan, they love you!
|-
!Stan
|They... love... me? ''(Pushes the curtain away to see the crowd cheering)''
|-
!Crowd
|''(Chants)'' Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan! ''(America guy rips his shirt open, revealing a bald eagle tattoo)''
|-
!Toby
|There he is! Mr. Pines, can we get a picture?
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Stan and Soos
|''(All pose)'' Yes we Stan!
|-
!
|''Toby takes their picture as a montage shows the twins continue to mind control Stan. Newspapers shown that Stan eventually gets the town's support and takes the lead. Cut to Bud slamming the [[Gravity Falls Gossiper|newspaper]] down in frustration.''

!Bud
|Gah! Darn it! Gosh hand huckleberry honey suckle darn it! Erm, excuse my language I'm so sorry. ''(Pulls out a pamphlet and starts to wipe himself with it) ''Oh, this is bad! This is real bad! I need to speak with my campaign manager, please excuse me for a moment. ''(Goes to another room then faces a screen and takes his hat off)'' Look, I'm sorry about all this. This is a minor setback, but... we'll win. I'm sure of it. ''(A camera then moves towards him)''
|-
![[Gideon Gleeful]]
|Minor setback? ''(Camera moves away to reveal Gideon on the screen)'' Minor setback!? You listen daddy and you'll listen good. Prison is a nightmare! ''(Gideon slams his fists down and Bud backs away from the screen)'' I eat the same slop everyday! They have no hair products in here! I can't sleep 'cause my cellmate took my pillow for a wife! You think I've been having fun in here?!

![[Ghost-Eyes]]

|-
!Prisoner
|Don't be late for friendship bracelet class!
|-
!Gideon
|I have finger painting at the same time! ''(Slams fist on desk and the prisoners leave)'' Whew! The mayor dying is my one ticket out of here. Which is why you're gonna win this election, pardon me out of prison and we're not gonna let the Pines, get in my way again! 
|-
!Bud
|But-but you don't understand. He's doing great in the polls! It's almost like magic!
|-
!Gideon
|Hmm, magic, you say? Well, maybe it's time to fight fire with fire! ''(Pulls out a page from[[ Journal 2]] out of his hair)'' I've been saving this for a long time! ''(Zooms in on the page that read "Possession Incantation")'' I've been waiting for the right moment.
|-
!Bud
|Boy, now, we've discussed this, no more spooky spells.
|-
!Gideon
|Well daddy, maybe you just need to have more... ''(whispers)'' of an open mind. Lleps live ykoops, lleps live ykoops, live ykoops...

|''As he chants, the lights start to swing his eyes begin to glow. The bulbs eventually flickered out and burst violently. He continues chanting the same words as Bud speaks.''

|Stan, wait! You can't ''— (Stan slams the door shut)'' Augh, this is bad. If we wanna beat Bud, we need another candidate, fast!

|What we need is a blank slate, someone totally suggestible! An empty piece of clay we can mold to our whims.

|You're making me very uncomfortable right now.

!Shandra
|Let the debate begin! ''(rings the bell)''
|-
![[Manly Dan]]
|First question. What's your position on axes! Wait, I mean... ''(squints on the card)'' taxes!
|-
!Stan
|Easy! Taxes are the worst. I propose we stimulate the economy by waging wars on neighboring cities. We. Have. The cannons. ''(The crowd boos)'' What? Uh... ''(looks desperately on his queue cards)''

|I don't know much about taxes, but I can promise you a kitten in every pot! ''(points accusingly to the right)'' That doesn't make sense, Mabel. ''(points accusingly to the right)'' ''You'' don't make sense, Dipper! ''(tie sparks up)''

|Friends, friends. Can't you see what's happening on this stage? These politicians are dancing around the issues. Well... I can sing around the issue! ''(rips apart his clothes to reveal a blue tank top, red sparkly pants and a belt with a small screen on it, catches a guitar and starts to sing)'' Oh [[crime is bad]]!

|And it seems you've been controlling Stanford! I figured it the both of y'all. You've got much eviller since I last saw you. Daddy! ''(snaps his fingers and Bud walks toward them)''
|-
!Mabel
|Let go of us! 
|-
!
|''Bud carries the twins to the elevator to the top of the mayor's memorial. Bud then proceeds to tie the twins up with the inside filled with fireworks.''
|-
!Gideon
|Behold, your grand view of the debate! Once I win this election, I'll finally rule this backwoods town! 
|-
!Mabel
|You'll never get away with this, you creepy little dork!
|-
!Gideon
|Oh, I'd be happy to spare you Mabel. If you agree to be mine. I even made you this wedding dress in crafts class! ''(whispers)'' Don't ask what it's made of.
|-
!Mabel
|Eww, I'd rather die, you creep!
|-
!Gideon
|Fine! Have it your way. Once I win, they'll hit the plunger for the fireworks display, finishing the mountain's construction, trapping y'all inside. I've been trapped behind concrete all summer, now see how you like it! ''(the twins gasp)'' Say hello to the next mayor of Gravity Falls, kids! Muwahahahahahaha! ''(the twins struggle to get out)''
|-
!
|''Cuts back to the stage.''
|-
!Stan
|And uh, that is why, um... the Statue of Liberty is our hottest landmark. ''(crowd boos and Stan's audience approval rating goes down)'' Alright alright, she's kind of mannish. What do you want from me?
|-
!
|''The crowd continues to shower Bud's box with the bird seeds as his audience approval ratings goes up with Bud smiling smugly at Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Augh. (grabs a piece of paper and wipes his forehead with it) You're dying out there, Stan. ''(sees that the paper is actually Dipper and Mabel's speech for him and his approval goes to zero)'' You kids were right all along. I should have listened to you when I had the chance. 
|-
!Mabel
|Help! Help us! 
|-
!Stan
|What the-? ''(looks to the mountain)''
|-
!Dipper
|We're tied to a bunch of fireworks! 
|-
!
|''The twins try to jump out, but end up cracking the rock under them, hanging from the nose screaming with the rope fraying fast. Tyler screams and points to the twins hanging. Everyone looks up and gasps.''
|-
!Stan
|''(yelling)'' KIDS!
|-
!
|''The rope begins to fray even more, almost completely snapped in two. The twins yell and stare in shock.''
|-
!Stan
|''(gasps, then turns to audience)'' Listen, everybody! This debate is over! I gotta go save my family!
|-
!Bud
|''(turning to audience)'' Those, uh, those are just some...demolition dummies. Nothing to see here!
|-
!Stan
|''(points at Bud)'' Can it, Gleeful!
|-
!
|''Stan rips the sleeves off of his jacket and yells. He runs backstage and begins climbing up one of the towers near the memorial. The crowd gets up from their seats and moves to watch Stan. As this is happening, Shandra narrates the situation.''
|-
!Shandra
|In a shocking turn of events, Stan Pines has run to the aid of two children who appear to be in danger!
|-
!
|''The excited crowd begins throwing their bird seed at Stan himself.''
|-
!Shandra
|And the crowd is ''loving'' it!
|-
!Stan
|''(Still climbing tower and is adjacent to the twins. Is shrugging off birdseed)'' No, stop it! ''(turns to crowd)'' Thank you, but stop it! ''(eagles begin flying around Stan)'' Aah! Get back, you terror birds! ''(Stan punches them out and keeps climbing)''
|-
!
|''Stan gets to the top of the tower and leaps from it to the memorial's nose as the crowd points at him. As he regains his balance, the rope snaps in two. Before it falls, Stan catches it and begins pulling the twins up.''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Grunkle Stan!
|-
!Stan
|''(pulling the rope)'' Kids! Look, I'm sorry I was being stubborn. I guess being the town's hero wasn't enough. I wanted to be yours too.
|-
!Mabel
|We're sorry, Grunkle Stan. We should've supported you, win or lose.
|-
!Dipper
|''(rolls eyes) Probably'' lose.
|-
!Stan
|I can still drop you, you know.
|-
!
|''Stan finishes pulling the kids up. They and Stan are safe inside the memorial. Stan hugs the kids while they laugh. Cut to outside the memorial, where the crowd cheers as Stan stands on top of the memorial's nose with the twins on either side of him. Stan's box is overflowing with birdseed, and his approval rating is through the roof. Bud stares in shock.''
|-
!Bud
|''(Sits down and bangs fists on floor)'' No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not again! ''(Steps down and grabs a primed remote detonator on the ground, glancing at the memorial)'' Time to take care of you, once and for all!
|-
!
|''Zoom in on the memorial, where Dipper, Mabel, and Stan are staring at Bud in shock.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no! We have to get out of here!
|-
!Stan
|''(solemn)'' Kids. If I die, make sure I get a bigger tombstone than Ford.
|-
!
|''The kids nod. Stan grabs them and jumps off of the memorial as Bud pushes the handle, blowing up the memorial. The kids and Stan scream, landing in the huge pile of Stan's bird seed unharmed. Cut to the crowd screaming and running away as chunks of the memorial rain down. One hits Bud and knocks him on the ground. Cut to static and zoom out to Gideon's cell, as his TV is knocked offline.''
|-
!Gideon
|No! ''(rips the Journal page in half) No! (grabs his TV, throws it offscreen, and yells while tearing his hair)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the debate stage. The timer has finished counting down, and the mayor picking eagle is set free. It caws, flies overhead, and settles down near Stan, kissing his head. Cut to the memorial, with half of it molten and destroyed. The view pans down to the stage, where Stan is helping the twins out of the bird seed pile. He brushes himself off.''
|-
!Crowd
|''(Cheering)'' Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines!
|-
!
|''Fireworks begin to go off in the background.''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, guess we know who won.
|-
!
|''Cut to TV screen showing Stan's face.''
|-
!Shandra
|''(on TV)'' This just in! Stanford Pines loses! ''(A red banner appears over Stan's face with the word "DISQUALIFIED" on it)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, and Stan in the Mystery Shack watching the TV.''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, and Stan
|WHAT?!
|-
!Shandra
|''(Now visible on the TV)'' Despite winning an overwhelming 95% of the vote, election officials had to disqualify him due to discovery of an extensive criminal record.
|-
!Stan
|Oh boy.
|-
!Mabel
|Stan, what did you do?
|-
!Stan
|What ''didn't'' I do?
|-
!Shandra
|''(looks at papers)'' Crimes include shoplifting, teaching bears to drive, a new crime he invented called "burglebezzlement", first-degree llamacide... ''(Her expression becomes increasingly confused the more she reads)''
|-
!Stan
|''(shakes fist)'' That llama knew too much.
|-
!Shandra
|''(on TV)'' Due to this shocking development, it would appear the mayorship passes to the only candidate who filled out their paperwork: local enthusiasm enthusiast Tyler Cutebiker.
|-
!
|''The view on the TV cuts to Tyler on a podium. Durland and Blubs give him a mayoral sash and a bouquet of flowers. He blushes as the crowd cheers.''
|-
!Tyler
|''(whispers) Got it.''
|-
!Shandra
|''(handed a gigantic stack of paper)'' We will dedicate the rest of this broadcast to listing Stan's crimes. ''(picks up the first sheet)'' First-degree thermometer theft. Pug trafficking.
|-
!
|''As Shandra says this, some crimes are listed on the TV screen. The crimes read "FIRST-DEGREE THERMOMETER THEFT. PUG TRAFFICKING. SNACKS EVASION. PICKPOCKETING. WOODPECKER BAITING. IMPERSONATING A DENTIST. GENERAL INDECENCY. GOLF CART THEFT. BINGO FRAUD. TELLING JOKES THAT JUST GO ON AND ON, I MEAN, I HAVE THINGS TO DO TODAY, REALLY." Stan shuts off the TV."''
|-
!Stan
|Whew! At least they didn't list any of the bad ones. On an unrelated topic, I have a lot of cheap pugs and I need to move them fast.
|-
!Dipper
|Aw, I'm sorry, Stan. I actually think you as mayor would've been fun.
|-
!Stan
|Eh, maybe it's for the best. I got close to the dream, though, kids.
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, I knit you something. ''(kneels down and gives Stan a sash that reads "OUR HERO")'' It's not official, but I think it fits. ''(gives the sash to Stan, who then sniffles)''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, are you crying?
|-
!Stan
|''(wipes eyes)'' I got campaign confetti in my eyes! ''(stands up and puts on the sash)'' Come on, kids. Wanna go vandalize Mayor Tyler's mansion?
|-
!Mabel
|Yay!
|-
!Dipper
|He-hey, vandalism!
|-
!
|''Stan walks offscreen, as the twins run to him.''
|-
!
|''Credits: Gideon is in prison, knitting with Ghost-Eyes.''
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|I'm sorry the election thing didn't work out for you, bro. But if it makes you feel any better, we're gonna throw a riot tonight! ''(sing-song)'' Does someone wanna throw a riot?
|-
!Gideon
|Thanks, Ghost-Eyes. I'm just not in the mood.
|-
!
|''Cut to night. Gideon is in bed, wide awake. He sits up in his bed.''
|-
!Gideon
|This poster is the only thing keeping me going. ''(looking at a poster that says "HANG ON TO THAT BRANCH OR DIE, CAT!")''
|-
!
|''Gideon gets up and rips the poster off of his wall. Underneath it is a chalk drawing of the [[Zodiac]]. The symbols aren't in their normal positions, and some of them are shaped differently. [[Bill Cipher|Bill]] is drawn in the middle, without his eye. Gideon then draws the eye using chalk.''
|-
!Gideon
|I'm finally ready to make a deal. ''(A yellow glow envelops Gideon)''
|-
!
|''End''

|''Cut to [[Ford Pines]] sleeping on the couch. Cut to [[Ford's mindscape|Ford's dream]], where he appears in a field of wheat with a ruined swingset, [[Interdimensional Portal|universe portal]], and the [[Stanowar]] around him. Ford looks around as the wheat is flattened around him into the image of [[Bill Cipher]], glowing blue. Ford hears Bill's maniacal laughter.''
|-
!Ford Pines
|I know that laugh... Show yourself! ''(Turns around as Bill Cipher materializes from the ground, floating in the air)''
|-
!Bill Cipher
|Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well! ''(Cuts to multiple copies of Bill materializing as he talks, forming a ring around Ford)'' Aren't you a sight for sore ''eye''! ''(All of the Bills mirror each other's movements)'' Stanford Filbrick Pines, my old pal!
|-
!Ford
|Bill Cipher. What do you want from me?
|-
!Bill
|Oh, quit playing dumb, IQ! ''(Another Bill talks:)'' You knew I'd be back! ''(The Bill that's talking flicks Ford's nose)'' You think shutting down that portal could stop what I have planned? ''(All the Bills merge into one giant Bill that floats over Ford)'' I've been making deals, chatting with old friends, preparing for the big day! You can't keep that [[Interdimensional rift|rift]] safe forever. ''(Snaps his fingers and a copy of the dimensional rift appears in his hand)'' You'll slip up, and when you do...! ''(Throws the rift onto the ground, where it creates a massive portal in the shape of an upside-down triangle, burning the wheat field around Ford)''
|-
!Ford
|Get out of here! You have no dominion in our world!
|-
!Bill
|Maybe not right now, but things change, Stanford Pines! ''(Ford is reflected in Bill's eye as Bill ascends up into the portal)'' Things... ''(Monster voice:)'' '''''change.'''''
|-
!
|''Bill laughs as he flies away, leaving Ford in the middle of the burning wheat field in the ring of fire. Several images flash by at once, one of Ford's hand, one of Ford's eye, and another of what looks like an extended version of the [[Zodiac]]. Ford wakes up in his bed, panting. He adjusts his glasses.''
|-
!Ford
|I have to warn them! ''(Looks at his hand)'' He's coming.
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!
|''Cut to a shot of the exterior of the Mystery Shack in the daytime. Cut to Dipper opening a closet door and Mabel rubbing her hands excitedly. The two look at the closet, which contains some stray items and board games.''
|-
!Dipper Pines
|''(Looks around the closet)'' Alright, [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan's]] gotta have ''some'' decent board games.
|-
!Mabel Pines
|Let's see, "Battlechutes & Ladderships," "Necronomiconopoly," "Don't Wake Stalin"...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Picks up a game)'' Hey, what's this? "[[What Could Go Wrong?: The Game|What Could Go Wrong?: The Board Game]]. The last players who opened this box never made it out alive."
|-
!Mabel
|''(After a short pause)'' Well, I know what we're doing today.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Talking over Mabel:)'' This should take up the next 21 minutes.
|-
!Ford
|''(Off-screen:)'' Family meeting! Family meeting!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel react to Ford's demand. Cut to Stan Pines and another man, presumably named Santiago, standing in front of a truck outside the Mystery Shack. Stan is holding a wooden barrel of pugs.''
|-
!Stan Pines
|Alright, Santiago. You have 24 hours to get these pugs across the U.S. border.
|-
!Ford
|''(Off-screen:)'' Family meeting! Family meeting!
|-
!Stan
|''(Gives Santiago the pugs)'' No te preocupas! Vamos! Vamos!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Dipper walking to Ford, who has several scrolls tucked under his arm and is reading a book. Ford turns around and notices the two, putting the scrolls on the table.''
|-
!Ford
|Ah, children. Come in, come in!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Takes a seat and looks at a bag on the table)'' Ooh, mysterious scrolls and potions! Are you going to tell us we're finally of age to go to wizard school? ''(Starts rummaging through the bag) ''Is there an owl in this bag?
|-
!Ford
|''(Snatches the bag away) ''No! I can assure you if there's an owl in this bag, he's long dead. ''(Mabel frowns, disappointed)'' Now, children, do either of you recognize ''this'' symbol? ''(Holds up a scroll emblazoned with the image of Bill Cipher and several hieroglyphs)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Dipper
|Bill.
|-
!Ford
|You... you know him?
|-
!Dipper
|''Know'' him? He's been terrorizing us all summer! I have so many questions and theories...
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper's been pretty paranoid since Bill turned him into a living sock puppet.
|-
!Dipper
|The important thing is we defeated him twice.
|-
!Mabel
|Once with [[Dreamscaperers|kittens]] and once with [[Sock Opera|tickles]]!
|-
!Dipper
|It was a lot more heroic than it sounds.
|-
!Ford
|The fact that you've dealt with Bill is gravely serious.
|-
!Dipper
|So, how do ''you'' know Bill?
|-
!Ford
|I've encountered many dark beings in my time, Dipper. What matters is that his powers are growing stronger, and if he pulls off his plans, no one in this family will be safe!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Ford
|Fortunately, there should be a way to shield us from his mental tricks. A way to Bill-proof the Shack. ''(Draws on a map of his lab)'' All I have to do is place moonstones here, here, and here, sprinkle some mercury, let's see... I always forget the last ingredient! ''(Takes out [[Journal 1]] and flips through it)'' Ugh, [[Unicorns|unicorn]] hair.
|-
!Dipper
|That's not, like, rare, is it?
|-
!Ford
|It's hopeless. ''(Looks at Journal 1; adjusts his glasses)'' Unicorns reside deep within an enchanted glade, and their hairs can only be obtained by a pure good-hearted person who goes on a magical quest to find them.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Screams)'' Grunkle Ford, can I ''please'' go on this quest? I am literally obsessed with unicorns! My first word was "unicorn," I once made my own unicorn by taping a traffic cone to a horse's head. ''(Cut to a photo that reads "BANNED FROM PETTING ZOO" and has a picture of Mabel near a disgruntled horse with duct tape and a traffic cone on its head)'' Are you even ''looking at the sweater I'm wearing right now?!'' Not to mention that I'm ''probably'' the most pure of heart person in this room.
|-
!Ford
|That's true, she has a point.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Talking over Ford:)'' I can't argue there.
|-
!Mabel
|So can I go on a mission to get that hair? Please please please? I'LL GIVE YOU MY ''BLOOD''!
|-
!Ford
|Very well. But it won't be easy. ''(Gives Mabel Journal 1)'' Take this. ''(Hands Mabel a crossbow)'' And this.
|-
!Mabel
|Oooh!
|-
!Ford
|I haven't been in this dimension for a while. It's okay to give children weapons, right?
|-
!Mabel
|Pssh, come on, dawg. ''(Fires the crossbow through the window, setting off [[Stanmobile|Stan's car]] alarm)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Off-screen:)'' AH! IT'S THE COPS! GUN IT! ''(Drives away accompanied by the sound of Pugs yapping)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To phone:)'' Candy, Grenda, Wendy, clear the afternoon! ''(Runs off)''
|-
!Dipper
|So, what are the odds she gets that hair?
|-
!Ford
|Unlikely. I've dealt with unicorns before, and if I had to describe them in one word it would be... frustrating.
|-
!Dipper
|So, what are we gonna do about Bill?
|-
!Ford
|Follow me.
|-
!
|''Dipper changes the sign on the Mystery Shack to "Closed." Dipper and Ford get into the elevator and get out onto the second floor.''
|-
!Ford
|Welcome to my private study, a place where I keep my most ancient and secret knowledge. Even your uncle Stan doesn't know about this place. ''(As Dipper stops to investigate a rectangular object covered by a sheet)'' Dipper, come along! If we can't Bill-proof the Shack, we're going to have to do the next best thing. ''(Holds up a helmet with wires on it)'' We're gonna have to Bill-proof our minds.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel, Candy, Grenda and Wendy in the woods.''
|-
!Mabel
|It's nice to finally be out on a mission, just us gals!
|-
![[Grenda]]
|Forget the gal talk! I'm here to meet, touch, and/or become a unicorn!
|-
![[Candy Chiu]]
|I hear if you lick a unicorn's neck, it tastes like your favorite flavor in the world!
|-
!Mabel
|Candy, I will make ''sure'' you lick that unicorn's neck, because I care about my friends.
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|Honestly, I stopped believing in unicorns when I was like, five years old. I'm just coming along to keep you kids from walking into a bear trap.
|-
!Mabel
|Stop! This is the magic part of the forest. ''(Opens Journal 1)'' Let's see, the [[gnomes|gnome]] tavern is over there, the [[fairies|fairy]] nail salon is over there, but it says that to summon the unicorn, one must bellow this ancient chant droned only by the deepest-voiced druids of old.
|-
!Grenda
|''(Takes the journal)'' On it! Oy-oyoy-oyoyoyoy...
|-
!Wendy
|I bet you ten bucks nothing happens.
|-
!Mabel
|I'll take that bet.
|-
!Mabel and Wendy
|''(Gasps)''

|-
!
|''Commercial break. Cuts to the four girls looking at the unicorn while a faun plays a pan flute nearby. The unicorn rears her head.''

!Celestabellebethabelle
|Hark! Visitors to my realm of enchantment!
|-
!
|''Both Mabel and Candy gasp, and while Grenda is doing the same thing a butterfly flies straight into her mouth, causing her to gag.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! What's your name?
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|I am Celestabellebethabelle, last of my kind. Come in, come in. Just, take off your shoes. I have a whole thing about shoes.
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Mabel
|''(Take off their shoes)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Ah, ah! I'm talking to everyone!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Grudgingly takes off her shoes)''
|-
!Mabel
|Celestabellebethabelle, we have journeyed far and wide--
|-
!Grenda
|About an hour!
|-
!Mabel
|On a mission to protect our family with your magical hair!
|-
!Candy
|''(Standing next to Celestabellebethabelle)'' This is your chance, Candy. Lick the neck. Lick it... ''(Tries to lick it but fails as Celestabellebethabelle stands her neck straight up)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Very well. To receive a lock of my enchanted hair, step forth, girl of pure perfect heart.
|-
!Mabel
|Presenting: bum buh da bum bum ba bum bum! ''(Kneels)'' Mabel!
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|What? You? A unicorn can see deep inside your heart, child. ''(Points at Mabel with her horn and her chest glows with a heart)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ugh! ''(Covers her chest)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|And you have done wrong. WRONG I say!
|-
!Mabel
|I guess I ''do'' make fun of Dipper a lot. And I ''did'' just shatter a window with a crossbow.
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Your bad deeds make me cry. ''(Her eyes well up, and a tear lands on a flower, killing it)''
|-
!Mabel
|NOOO!
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Come back when you're PURE OF HEART. NEEEIIGGGHH! Exit is that way. Shoes, shoes, take your shoes. This isn't some... some... shoe store.
|-
!
|''The humans leave and the gate closes.''
|-
!Grenda
|Hey, Mabel, don't let her get to you.
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah, I wouldn't trust a horse that wears makeup.
|-
!Mabel
|No, girls, she's right. I used to be one of the sweetest people I knew, but recently I've been slacking in the whole goodness department. Well, today we're gonna fix it. From this moment forth I'm gonna do so many good deeds, I'll have the purest heart in [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]! ''(Pumps fist in the air and accidentally punches a bird out of the air which opens Wendy's, Candy's, and Grenda's mouth as a form of minor shock for Mabel accidently punching that bird)'' That... that bird is fine.
|-
!
|''Cut to Ford's lab. Ford hooks Dipper up to the [[Project Mentem|mind machine]].''
|-
!Dipper
|So what is Bill, exactly? 
|-
!Ford
|No one knows for sure. Accounts differ of his true motivations and origins. ''(While Ford is talking, Dipper picks up "The Cipher File" and starts reading it)'' I know he's older than our galaxy and far more twisted. Without a physical form, he can only project himself into our thoughts through the mindscape. That's why he wants ''this. (Holds up [[interdimensional rift]])'' I dismantled the portal, but with this tear, Bill still has a way into our reality. To get his hands on this rift, he would trick or possess anyone.
|-
!Dipper
|So how do we keep Bill out of our minds?
|-
!Ford
|Well, there's a number of ways. I personally had a metal plate installed in my head.
|-
!Dipper
|Heheh. Good one.
|-
!Ford
|''(Knocks the side of his head, making a metallic sound)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Coughs and clears his throat)''
|-
!Ford
|But this machine is safer. It will scan your mind, bioelectrically encrypting your thoughts so that Bill can't read them. ''(Turns it on)'' Now say hello to your thoughts.
|-
!Dipper
|''(On machine:)'' Oh, man, I can't believe I'm with the author. Is my fly down? ''(Singing:)'' [[Disco Girl|DISCO GIRL]]! COMING THROUGH! ''(Talking:)'' Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. ''(Speaking to Ford:)'' You might wanna... ignore that last one. By the way, you never told me what your history with Bill was.
|-
!Ford
|Dipper, do you trust me?
|-
!Dipper
|Well, yeah, but-
|-
!Ford
|Then you'll trust that that's not important. Now, focus. It's time to strengthen your mind.
|-
!
|''Cut to Candy, Grenda, Mabel and Wendy on the sidewalk.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, Mabel, it's time to strengthen your heart.
|-
!
|''[[Mabel's Good Deeds Montage|Montage]]: Mabel picks snails off the sidewalk and puts them on large grass. Mabel digs a hole and Grenda puts a tree in it. [[Toby Determined]] tries to come outside but the tree has blocked his door. Mabel puts a giant smiley face sticker on Stan's face. He screams and breaks his lamp in the process. Mabel donates three pints of blood, then faints. Mabel stops traffic for some ducks to cross, paints glitter on the statue of [[Nathaniel Northwest]], fills [[Lazy Susan|Lazy Susan's]] tip jar, and she, Candy, Grenda, and Wendy help a woman with her groceries.''

!Singer
|''(Over montage) Share a smile!''

Dream a dream!

Share a smile!

Plant a tree!

Doing some good deeds!

Halt! And smile!

Love them tight!

Doing good deeds!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Looking at a checklist of good deeds; spoken over Candy, Grenda and Wendy's cheering)'' Boom! A thousand good deeds. When that unicorn scans my heart, she's gonna say I'm absolutely, one hundred percent, bona fide-

!
|''Cut to Celestabellebethabelle's fortress.''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Not pure of heart.
|-
!Mabel
|Booyah! Wait, what?
|-
!Wendy
|How is that even possible? Mabel's a straight up saint, you judgmental hoofbag!
|-
!Mabel
|Please, tell me what I'm doing wrong!
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Doing good deeds to make yourself look better isn't good at all. Not to mention you're crushing, like, ten dandelions right now. Those are basically children's dreams.

|''(Gets off the dandelions and gasps)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|I'm sorry, Mabel. It's not my fault you're a bad person.
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Wendy
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs off crying)''
|-
!Wendy
|Mabel, wait! Come back!
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 3 o'clock posing in front of a rainbow. ''(Poses in front of a rainbow)'' NeigheighEIGHEIGHeigheigh.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel lying down outside. Candy, Grenda and Wendy walk up to her.''
|-
!Wendy
|Come on, Mabel. Don't beat yourself up about this.
|-
!Candy
|Let's forget about getting that dumb unicorn hair.
|-
!Mabel
|It's not about the hair anymore, guys. It's about me. Being kind and sweet is what makes me who I am. If I'm not a good person, who am I? I'm not leaving this spot until I think of a deed that makes me as good as Celestabellebethabelle.
|-
!Candy
|But, Mabel...
|-
!Mabel
|Just leave me be.
|-
!Wendy
|Pst. ''(Ushers Candy and Grenda away)'' Guys, if you ask me, this whole thing is a serious load. Mabel's like the best person I've ever met. We tried getting that hair the good way. Now it's time we try... the Wendy way. ''(Wendy then punches and rubs her left fist against her right hand as a way of signaling a violent gesture)''
|-
!Grenda
|Are you suggesting violence? Sabotage?
|-
!Candy
|Mabel's not going to like that.
|-
!Wendy
|Mabel doesn't need to know. Look, it's time we stop trying to be so "perfect" and be who we really are. We're crazed, angry, sweaty animals! We're not unicorns, we're WOMEN! ''AND WE TAKE WHAT WE WANT! (Punches a tree which brings a couple of leaves down to the ground)''
|-
!Candy and Grenda
|Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
|-
!Grenda
|''(Smashes a rock on her head)'' Too much?
|-
!Wendy
|Here's what we're gonna do.
|-
!
|''Cut to Gnasty's.''
|-
!Gnome
|Get me a flaggon of your daintiest honeysuckle, please.
|-
!Bartender
|I'm gonna need to see some ID.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Kicks the door open)''
|-
!Gnome 2
|It's the cops! Hit the deck! ''(Another Gnome flings himself out the window)''
|-
!Wendy
|I'm lookin' for someone who knows how to take down a unicorn! No tricks or games!
|-
!Candy
|''(Smashes a bottle)'' We are human! We take what we want!
|-
!Grenda
|Yeah!
|-
!Gnome 3
|Fairy dust. A whole magic bag's enough to put a unicorn out cold. But if I do you a favor, you gotta do somethin' for me.
|-
!Grenda
|Just, spill it, half-pint! ''(slams her fist against a tree stump)''
|-
!Gnome 3
|Butterfly trafficking is illegal in this part of the forest, but I like butterflies. They tickle my face and make me laugh. Bring me a bag of butterflies and we got a deal.
|-
!Grenda and Wendy
|''(Nod)''
|-
!
|''Cut to a net grabbing a butterfly. Cut back to Gnasty's. Grenda approaches the gnome and gives him the bag of butterflies.''
|-
!Gnome 3
|Two bags of fairy dust, just like we agreed.
|-
!Grenda
|Where do you get this stuff?
|-
!Gnome 3
|Everyone likes sausage, but no one likes to know how it's made.
|-
!Grenda
|You disgust me.
|-
!Gnome 3
|You got your poison; I got mine; we made a deal.
|-
!Grenda
|Yeah, well, the deal is OFF!
|-
!
|''Several policemen gnomes run out of the bushes.''
|-
!Policeman
|Freeze! You're under arrest! Get down! Get down!
|-
!Gnome 3
|These butterflies aren't mine! I swear! I've been framed!
|-
!Policeman
|Tell it to the adorable owl we've dressed as a judge. ''(To Grenda:)'' My cut.
|-
!Grenda
|''(Gives him one of the bags)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Writing in her notepad)'' Good deeds. Good deeds. Aww that's not good enough! Come on, Mabel, you can do better than that!
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Wendy
|''(Enter Celestabellebethabelle's house)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|''(Reading [[Whinny, Pray, Trot]])'' Oh sure, sure, I wish I could travel, but it's just not feasible in this economy- ''(Gets hit with the fairy dust)'' What the hay?! ''(Faints)''
|-
!Faun
|''(Nervously plays S.O.S in morse code on pipes)''
|-
!Grenda
|''(Puts a towel over its mouth)'' Sleep now! Sleeeeep. ''(Pulls the faun away as it loses consciousness)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Takes scissors and some of Celestabellebethabelle's hair)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Enters the fortress)'' No wait! Stop!
|-
!Wendy
|Mabel! Shh! You'll wake her up!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Takes scissors)'' But this is wrong, guys!
|-
!Wendy
|But protecting the Shack is good.
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|''(Gets up and sees Mabel with the scissors)'' What? Doth mine eyes deceive me? Thief! You shall never be pure of heeeaart!
|-
!Mabel
|No! You don't understand! I just want to be good like you!
|-
!Blue unicorn
|''(Offscreen:)'' Whoa, whoa, whoa, you gotta be kidding me. ''(Enters with the red unicorn)'' Yo, C-beth, are you seriously pulling this "pure of heart" scam again?
|-
!Red unicorn
|That is messed up, man.
|-
!Mabel
|Wait, scam?
|-
!Red unicorn
|Kid, unicorns can't see into your heart. All our dumb horns can do is glow, point towards the nearest rainbow and play rave music. ''(Plays music)''
|-
!Blue unicorn
|Yeah, the whole "pure of heart" racket is just a line we use to get humans to leave us alone.
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Guuuyys. Shut uuupp.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Crushes notepad) ''All this time. All this time I thought I was a bad person. But you're even ''worse'' than I am! ''(Throws the notepad with "Mabel's Sins" written on it to the ground)''
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Wendy
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Okay, fine. So you learned our secret. We're jerks, okay? We have more hair than we know what to do with, and we keep it to ourselves just to tick humans off. ''(Mockingly:) ''What are you gonna do about it, huh, huh? What are ya gonna DO?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Punches Celestabellebethabelle)''
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Oh!
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Wendy
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Wendy
|WHOO! Go Mabel!
|-
!Grenda
|Join the dark side!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Growls and tears the unicorn image off of her sweater)''
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Wendy
|Fight! Fight! Fight!
|-
!Celestabellebethabelle
|Oh. So it's a fight you want. Well, then it's a fight you're gonna get!
|-
!
|''The humans and the unicorns run at each other. Cut to Ford's lab, where a screen says "SCANNING THOUGHTS 15%."''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, this is taking forever. How long have I been doing this for? ''(Sees that Ford is asleep)'' Why does he have to be so mysterious about Bill? I can handle the truth. ''(Thoughts on machine:)'' I wonder what Great Uncle Ford is thinking. Use the machine! It'll show you his thoughts. ''(Speaking:)'' I shouldn't... ''(On machine:)'' He won't know. He's going to tell you eventually. The more you know about Bill, the more you can help. ''(Speaking:)'' Man, I am really good at rationalizing. ''(On machine:)'' Yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are. ''(Puts the helmet on Ford's head; speaking:)'' Just a little peek. What are you hiding about Bill?
|-
!
|''Bill appears on the screen, cackling. Screen changes to Stanford moving around in his sleep. Smaller screens show the portal and [[Old Man McGucket|Fiddleford McGucket]] yelling at Ford.''
|-
!McGucket
|Where are these ideas coming from? Who are you working with?!
|-
!
|''Screens change to Ford writing "I'M LOSING," "MY MIND," and "TRUST NO ONE" in the journal.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Voice on machine:)'' My brother is a dangerous know-it-all...
|-
!Ford
|''(On machine:)'' He would trick or possess anyone... ''(As a young man:)'' Then it's a deal. From now until the end of time.
|-
!Bill
|''(Holding out hand, which is on fire)'' Just let me into your mind, Stanford.
|-
!Ford
|Please, call me... ''(Shaking hands)'' a friend.
|-
!Bill
|''(Possessing Ford, cackling)''
|-
!Dipper
|FORD AND BILL?! ''(Gasps)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Stands up)'' You shouldn't have done that. ''(Takes off helmet and throws it, knocking down a curtain, revealing many items depicting Bill)''
|-
!Dipper
|Why- why were you shaking hands with Bill? ''(Picks up interdimensional rift)'' You said Bill could possess anyone so he could get this. ''(The rift slips out of his hand, and he catches it)'' Ahh!
|-
!Ford
|Careful! Hand me the rift! Now, boy!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Backing away)'' Why were you really scanning my thoughts? ''(Aims [[memory erasing gun]] at Ford)'' Are you Bill right now?!
|-
!Ford
|Now just-just calm down, P-
|-
!Dipper
|''(scared)'' PINE TREE?! ''IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA CALL ME?!''
|-
!Ford
|I was just going to say "please", kid!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Stops at the end of the room)'' Great Uncle Ford told me to protect the rift! Get one step closer and I'll shoot! I'll erase you right out of Ford's head!
|-
!Ford
|It's me, Dipper. It's your uncle!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Charging gun)'' Trust no one, trust no one, trust...
|-
!Ford
|Hand it to me!
|-
!
|''The gun fires at Ford, but bounces off his glasses and around the room, finally destroying one of the screens.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Tries to pick up the memory erasing gun)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Picks Dipper up before he can get the gun)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Trying to hit him)'' Let go of me!
|-
!Ford
|Now-now just calm down. Calm down! ''(adjusts his glasses)'' Look into my eyes! Look at my pupils. It's me, Dipper. It's me. ''(Sets him down)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' I tried to erase your mind. I'm so sorry.
|-
!Ford
|It's okay, Dipper. Besides, my mind can't be erased, anyway, remember? ''(Knocks the side of his head)'' If I really was Bill, though, you would've done great. I should of been more like you when I was young. Dipper, I was a fool to try to hide all this. The reason I've been trying to prepare you for Bill's tricks is that Bill tricked me. It's the biggest regret of my life. Bill wasn't always my enemy, Dipper. I used to think he was my friend. Long, long ago. ''(Flashback to Ford as a young man in front of a printer)'' I had hit a road block in my investigation of Gravity Falls. ''(Punches the drawing of the question mark he had made on his chalkboard; cut to him in a cave)'' Until I found some mysterious writing in a cave. Ancient incantations about a being with answers. It warned me not to read them, but I was desperate. I read the inscription aloud. But nothing happened. Until later that afternoon, when I had the most peculiar dream. ''(Ford is sleeping under a tree. The knots on the trees become Bill eyes and the rest of the backround fades into abstraction. Journals and pages are floating about randomly. Ford gets up and walks around.)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Comes up behind him)'' Hiya, smart guy! ''(Circles around him)'' Woah, don't have a heart attack, you're not 92 yet.
|-
!Ford
|''(In flashback)'' Who are you?
|-
!Bill
|Name's Bill! And your name's Stanford Pines, the man who changed the world, but I'm getting ahead of ourselves; let's relax! Care for a game of interdimensional chess? ''(Chessboard appears)'' Have a cup of tea. ''(Teapot pours tea into a teacup)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Voice-over from the present:)'' He told me he was a muse. That he chose one brilliant mind a century to inspire. What a fool I was. Blinded by his flattery and games. He became my research assistant. He was free to move in and out of my mind as he pleased. ''(Cut to Ford summoning Bill, who possesses him.)'' We were partners. ''(Cut to Ford and Bill in the mindscape, doing an equation with a picture of the [[Universe portal]] next to it)'' When he told me I could complete my research by building a gateway to other worlds, I trusted him. He said this was the way genius happened. Little help from a friend. ''(Cut to Ford and McGucket in front of the portal)'' It seems that I was on the verge of my greatest achievement! ''(The portal activates; cut to Ford with McGucket, who is unconscious)'' Until my partner got a glimpse of Bill's true plans. ''(Cut to Ford approaching Bill)'' Bill! You lied to me! Where does that portal really lead?
|-
!Bill
|''(Looking at what looks like a scar in space with dark shapes in it)'' Hoho! Looks like Mr. Brainiac finally got smart! Let's just say that when that portal finishes charging up, your dimension is gonna learn how to party! ''(To the scar:)'' Right, guys?
|-
!
|''Roaring and cackling is heard from the scar.''
|-
!Ford
|No! I'll stop you! I'll SHUT IT DOWN!
|-
!Bill
|A deal's a deal, Sixer! You can't stop a bridge between our worlds from coming, but ''it would be fun to watch you try!'' Cute even!
|-
!Ford
|''(Wakes up, shocked)'' I'd been betrayed. I shut the portal down, ''(Cut to Ford shutting the portal down)'' severing the link between Bill's world and ours. I had to hide my instructions so no one could ever finish Bill's work. ''(Cut to the present)'' Bill's been waiting for the gateway to reopen ever since. All he needs to do is get his hands on this rift. To Bill, it's just a game, but to ''us'', it would mean the ''end'' of our world.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, man.
|-
!Ford
|Oh, man, indeed.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Ford in the living room drinking [[Pitt Cola]].''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, I'm so embarrassed about earlier. I'm such an idiot.
|-
!Ford
|From now on, no more secrets between us. We're not the first two idiots to be tricked by Bill, boy. But if we work together, we ''could'' be the last.
|-
!Dipper
|But what about Bill? I broke the machine! Now we have no way to protect the shack!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Slams the unicorn hair on the table)'' Did someone say "unicorn hair"?!
|-
!
|''Candy, Grenda, Mabel and Wendy are behind her. They are all beat up and covered in unicorn fluids and tears.''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, no, actually?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh. That would have been perfect. Either way we got some unicorn hair! ''(Waves it in Dipper's face)''
|-
!Candy
|Also some unicorn tears, unicorn eyelashes... ''(Gestures to Grenda, who has unicorn eyelashes)''
|-
!Grenda
|They finally gave us this treasure just to get rid of us! ''(Dumps treasure on table)''
|-
!Ford
|It... can't be! This is a great day, girls! With this unicorn hair, we should be able to completely shield the shack from Bill's mind-reading tricks!
|-
!Mabel
|Is it okay?
|-
!Ford
|Better than okay; it's perfect! You've protected your family. You're a good person, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Thanks, Grunkle Ford, but today I learned that morality is relative.
|-
!Stan
|''(Runs in and grabs the treasure)'' MONEY!! ''(Runs away)''
|-
!
|''End credits: Dipper and Ford are in the yard. Dipper finishes stretching the unicorn hair around the shack. A force field forms around the shack.''
|-
!Ford
|Perfect! This will protect us from Bill! As long as we're inside, our minds are safe.
|-
!Bill
|''(Watching them from the mindscape)'' I guess I can't possess anyone ''in''side the shack, so I'll just have to find my next pawn on the ''(Voice gets lower:)'' OUTSIDE. ''(Eye flashes between several characters)''

|''Episode opens with the [[Mystery Shack]], to the back of [[Stan's RV|Grunkle Stan's RV]]. Grunkle Stan puts a bumper sticker on it that says "CAUTION: SILVERFOX AT THE WHEEL" as Soos helps pack it up.''
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|''(Hums)'' Nice. And don't forget bug spray! It's perfect for spraying in the face of hitchhikers.
|-
![[Dipper Pines]]
|Whoa. An RV? Camping gear? Are you running from the law again?
|-
![[Soos Ramirez]]
|''(On top of RV)'' Dude! It's the ultimate Oregon road trip adventure!
|-
!Stan
|More like ''revenge'' trip. Every year my tourist trap competitors prank the Mystery Shack. Last year those hooligans duct taped Soos to the ceiling.
|-
!Soos
|That was a fun 78 hours.
|-
!Stan
|Well, no more! ''(Pulls out a map of Oregon's tourist traps and hands it to Dipper)'' This year we're visiting every tourist trap along the Redwood Highway, and I'm gonna prank back every single one.
|-
![[Grenda]]
|Bow wow! Time to let the road dogs ''bark''!
|-
![[Candy Chiu]]
|That is us. We are the road dogs.
|-
![[Mabel Pines]]
|Thanks for letting me bring Candy and Grenda along for our road trip, Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Stan
|The more the merrier. Just sign these non-disclosure agreements. None of your parents are lawyers, right? ''(Stan, Candy, and Grenda walk into the RV)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Jumps down from the roof of the RV)'' What do ya say, dude? You comin'?
|-
!Mabel
|I already went to the trouble of packing all your stuff. Even the stuff you kept in that secret box under the bed. ''(drops the box, pictures of [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] coming out of it)'' Whoa. What the...? Ugh, ''what's that?''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Starts cleaning the pictures up)'' Uh, nothing! Just...Wendy stuff...from old times.
|-
!Mabel and Soos
|''Ughh.''
|-
!Mabel
|Bro, I thought you were finally past all this.
|-
!Dipper
|Ahh, I know, I know! I know she's not interested and I know it's over, but how do you just turn off the way you feel about someone?
|-
!Mabel
|Two words, Dipper. Move. On.
|-
!Soos
|Yeah, dude. And a road trip's the perfect place to meet new people.
|-
!
|''Dipper looks at a picture of Wendy, then at the pamphlet. He looks up into the sky and smiles.''
|-
!
|''(Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]])''
|-
!
|''The RV bounds across the open road. Stan is driving as Soos pants with his tongue sticking out.''
|-
!Grenda
|Man, RVs are amazing. I can't believe we're sitting at a table in a moving vehicle!
|-
!Candy
|Ooh! Informational travel pamphlets. ''(Pressing pamphlets to her cheeks) ''I want to read them all and gain their travel knowledge.
|-
!Stan
|Kid, those useless pamphlets have never helped a single person. The only wrinkly old travel guide you'll need is me. Now look alive! We're coming up on an attraction run by the most black-hearted proprietor in all of Oregon.
|-
!
|''Cut to a sign outside [[Granny Sweetkin's Yarnball]]. The RV pulls up next to it and stops.''
|-
!Stan
|Don't let the face fool you. This woman lit my car on fire on two non-consecutive occasions.
|-
!
|''Cut to outside the RV. The kids have gotten out and are staring at the yarn ball.''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Candy and Grenda
|Whoa.
|-
!Mabel
|I'm going in, girls. Waaah. ''(Mabel goes inside the yarn. Candy laughs and follows her.)''
|-
!Grenda
|Yarn! ''(goes inside the yarn)''
|-
!
|''A tourist girl walks by Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay. Like Soos said, meet new people. ''(Walks up to girl and clears throat)'' So, uh...come here often?
|-
!Unnamed tourist girl
|No. I'm a tourist.
|-
!Dipper
|''(laughs nervously)'' You're funny. And cute. I mean, not cute. I mean, you're not ''not'' cute. Phew, let me start over. ''(extending hand)'' My name is Dopper. ''(She dumps her ice cream in his hand and walks away as Dipper sighs)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Over the walkie talkie:)'' Dipper, hup to! This ball a' yarn ain't gonna prank itself.
|-
!
|''Dipper takes a piece of the yarn ball from Mabel and ties it to the back of the RV. He sighs.''
|-
!Stan
|Something on your mind, kiddo? You're thinking about miss cold shoulder over there, huh?
|-
!Dipper
|Ahh, I'm so embarrassed. Look, earlier this summer I ruined my chances with Wendy.
|-
!
|''As they talk, Mabel and Grenda pop out of the top of the yarn ball and high-five.''
|-
!Stan
|Heh, yeah. Chances.
|-
!
|''Mabel and Grenda begin unraveling the yarn ball behind them.''
|-
!Dipper
|And I wanna move on, but I'm terrible at talking to girls. The moment I open my mouth around them I unravel like...like...well, I can't think of a perfect metaphor, but you get the gist. At this rate, I'm going to grow up to be a sad loner like [[Toby Determined]].
|-
!Stan
|Whoa. Never say that about yourself. Lucky for you I'm an expert on women. Listen to me, kid. When it comes to girls always be confident. And be funny, but not too funny. And be kinda annoying but in a lovable way.
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know, Grunkle Stan. This sounds kinda jerky.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, jerky is just a term non-jerks use to bad mouth innocent jerks. Confidence, comedy, some third word starting with a C. The three Cs of the Stan Pines dating technique! At the next tourist trap, try out my advice on the first girl you see.
|-
!Dipper
|Cool. Grunkle Stan, thanks.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, I'm full a good ideas. Speakin' of which, everyone! Now!
|-
!
|''Dipper, Stan, and Soos run into the RV. Mabel, Candy, and Grenda get out of the yarn ball and follow them. The RV speeds away, unraveling the yarn ball completely.''
|-
![[Granny Sweetkin]]
|Why, you gall darn son of a no good. ''(Takes a nail out of the ground and throws it at the RV)'' I'll get you, Stan Pines!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Upside-Down Town]]. The RV pulls up and stops.''
|-
!Stan
|Ah, Upside-Down Town. The nausea capital of the state. Whatever you do, don't use the bathrooms.
|-
!
|''The kids put on shoes with Velcro on the bottom, so they can walk on the carpeted ceiling.''
|-
!Mabel, Candy and Grenda
|Road dogs! Woof, woof, woof!
|-
!
|''The kids get aligned with the ceiling and walk into the house, laughing.''
|-
!Grenda
|Nice!
|-
!Mabel
|This is so weird!
|-
!
|''Dipper walks in as he notices [[Emma Sue]].''
|-
!Stan
|''(in Dipper's head:)'' Alright, kid. This is it. Be confident.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Clears throat)'' Hi, I'm Dipper. Crazy place, right?
|-
!Emma Sue
|Oh, hi. I'm Emma Sue. You know, if you pretend we're right side up, it looks like everyone's hair is standing on end.
|-
!Dipper
|Huh. Yeah, weird, right? Pretend you're screaming.
|-
!Emma Sue
|Okay. You gotta take a picture of me, though. ''(Screams as Dipper takes a picture with her phone)''
|-
!Dipper
|Let's see about--whoa! ''(He lets go of the phone before catching it)'' Huh-hoh, just kidding. ''(laughs)''
|-
!Emma Sue
|''(playfully:)'' You are the worst. ''(softly punches Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|You bet I am. I'm bad, Emma. Kind of a jerk.
|-
!Emma Sue's Father
|Emma, come on! We have to get to Canada before your mother gives birth!
|-
!Emma Sue
|It's a long story.
|-
!Dipper
|Maybe you could tell me sometime.
|-
!Emma Sue
|Here's my email address. Write me and I'll tell you all about it. ''(Writes her email on Dipper's hand and walks away)''
|-
!Dipper
|A girl gave me her email. And it wasn't out of pity! Haha! Yes! ''(Jumps in the air and falls to the floor, landing next to Mabel)'' I'm okay. I'm better than okay. Mabel, hi. There's my Grenda. Candy, looking great, looking great. Is that a new pair of glasses? Very shiny. ''(Candy blushes deeply)'' Hahaha. Wooo!
|-
!Grenda
|Maybe it's the blood pooling in my head, but Dipper seems different. ''(Groans as her forehead turns purple)''
|-
!Candy
|Yes. Good different.
|-
!Stan
|''(off screen)'' Now, Soos!
|-
!
|''Stan and Soos start jumping on the floor, rolling the house and turning it right-side up. The gang runs to the RV and drives away.''
|-
!Stan
|Not so upside-down now! ''(laughs)''
|-
!Civilian
|What a lovely normal home!
|-
![[Upside Down Town Boss|Upside-Down Town Boss]]
|Stan Pines!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Looks at Emma's e-mail)'' I can't believe it worked. What do I do now? Do I e-mail her?
|-
!Stan
|No, no, no. You practice. The more girls you talk to, the better you get at it.
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, these tips are priceless.
|-
!Stan
|And that's just the tip of the advice-berg.
|-
!
|''(A montage begins. Dipper flirts with girls at Log Land and the [[Corn Maze]] as Stan sabotages the attractions. Soos walks into a random area of the Corn Maze as the rest of the gang runs back into the RV.)''
|-
!Stan
|Everyone on board?
|-
!Mabel
|Probably.
|-
!
|''The RV drives away, leaving Soos behind.''
|-
!Soos
|Guys? Hello? Anyone? They'll come back for me.
|-
!
|''Cut to Septic Ridge RV Park at night. Dipper and Stan are relaxing in a hot tub.''
|-
!Stan
|So then I said to the bouncer, "Where's your ID, ugly?" ''(points to a scar on his under right arm)'' That's where I got ''this'' scar.
|-
!Dipper
|''(laughs)'' Grunkle Stan, I gotta say this was one of the best days ever. Look! ''(Holds up arms with phone numbers on them)''
|-
!Stan
|That's the Stan Pines method, kid. Works every time.
|-
!Dipper
|I'm just a little worried, though. I mean is it bad to flirt with this many girls at once? I'm just tryin'a get over Wendy. I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings.
|-
!Stan
|Please. That's the best part 'a flirting on a road trip. You're not gonna see any of these gals again. To moving on! ''(Stan and Dipper laugh)''
|-
!
|''Screen pans to Mabel, Grenda and Candy sitting at a bonfire next to the RV, eating marshmallows and laughing.''
|-
!Mabel
|Okay, it's time for...
|-
!Mabel and Grenda
|...Truth or Dare or Don't! ''(point at Candy)''
|-
!Candy
|I choose... don't!
|-
!Grenda
|Ugh! You always choose don't.
|-
!Candy
|Fine. Uh, truth.
|-
!Mabel
|Do you...''like'' someone? ''(Candy blushes)''
|-
!Grenda
|Uh-oh. Someone's blushing.
|-
!Candy
|Okay, maybe just a little. I don't know for sure. It just... started.
|-
!Mabel and Grenda
|Tell us! Tell us!
|-
!Candy
|Okay. It begins with a "D" and ends with an "ipper."
|-
!Mabel
|''(shocked)'' No.
|-
!Candy
|Yes.
|-
!Mabel and Grenda
|''(Gasp)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ready, Grenda? Three. Two. One. ''(Mabel and Grenda gasp before screaming loudly. Dipper and Stan look around.)''
|-
!Stan
|Man, coyotes sound a lot worse than I remember.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Giggling with Grenda)'' Candy. Candy! All my life dreams are coming true right now. My brother. My best friend.
|-
!Grenda
|I can't breathe! I'm so excited I can't ''breathe! (Falls backwards)''
|-
!Candy
|I never really noticed him before, but he seems different lately. Less sweaty, and more charming. But how do I approach him?
|-
!Mabel
|Don't even worry about that, Can-Can. Mabel's got a plan. ''(Shoves marshmallows in her mouth)'' Mabel's got a plan.
|-
!
|''Cut to the road. The RV is back on the highway.''
|-
!Stan
|Alright, campers. We got another day 'a breakin' laws and breakin' hearts. Everything up until now has been a walk in the park compared to our next attraction.
|-
!Mabel
|Is it a walk in the world's biggest park?
|-
!Stan
|Eh, sort of. There she is, kids. [[Mystery Mountain]]. Five times the size of the Mystery Shack, and what's worse: she has real attractions.
|-
!Candy
|Oh! I have read about this place. It has sky tram. And a mummy museum. And sightings of [[Arachnimorphs|half human, half spider creatures]].
|-
!Stan
|Even their made up legends are better than ours. Today, the mountain ''falls''.
|-
!Mabel
|''(nods at Grenda)'' Question. The back seat makes me car sick. Can I sit up front today?
|-
!Grenda
|Also question. I'm the size of two people. Can I have a whole seat to myself?
|-
!Candy
|''(looks up from the pamphlet and blushes)''
|-
!Stan
|Eh, I don't know, sure.
|-
!Mabel
|''(runs to shotgun seat)'' Whooo! Change up! ''(yells as she pushes Dipper out of the seat and into the back seat)''
|-
!Dipper
|But wait! That means it'll just be me and-- ''(looks at Candy, who is sitting next to her)''
|-
!Candy
|''(blushing)'' Candy Chiu! 6th grade!
|-
!Dipper
|''(jumps back)'' Whoa! Hey.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Candy awkwardly sit in silence. After a few seconds, Candy moves closer to Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|You're sitting close.
|-
!Grenda
|''(giggles with Mabel as she moves a curtain over the back seat)''
|-
!Candy
|So, Dipper. I was wondering, would you maybe want to walk around the Mystery Mountain with me today?
|-
!Dipper
|Ssssure, I mean, wasn't that already the plan? ''(scoots away from Candy)''
|-
!Candy
|I mean, just us. You and me. Candy and Dipper.
|-
!
|''Dipper looks shocked as Stan slams the brakes on the car, coming to a stop in front of the Mystery Mountain entrance. Cut to Stan outside the RV.''
|-
!Stan
|Alright, road dogs! I got five bucks for whoever can tip the big blue ox! Go, go, go! ''(Ushers Mabel and Grenda out)''
|-
!Candy
|''(to Dipper:)'' I will see you in there! ''(giggles and walks away)''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, what's up with the mopey mug, kid?
|-
!Dipper
|Stan! You gotta help me! Everything you taught me worked ''too'' well! I think Candy just asked me out on a date!
|-
!Stan
|He-hey! ''(punches Dipper's shoulder)'' Look at this little champion!
|-
!Dipper
|What? No! I-I mean, Candy's great, she's sweet and she's smart, but I've never thought of her like ''that!'' Th-th-this is all moving way too fast. ''(sits down, panting)'' Okay. I just need to be honest with her and tell her I-I'm not ''ready'' for all this.
|-
!Stan
|''(laughs and shakes his head)'' Don't you see what's happening here? That's your dumb obsession with Wendy gettin' in the way of your future! If you wanna move on, you've gotta say yes to whatever comes your way. ''(walks toward ticket booth and looks at [[Darlene]])'' Speaking of which...
|-
!
|''Darlene grins at Stan.''
|-
!Dipper
|But I don't wanna lead her on!
|-
!Stan
|Ah ah ah! Watch and learn. (''walks to ticket booth; searches pockets)'' Oh, I seem to have lost my number! ''(flirt-like) ''Can I borrow ''yours?''
|-
!Darlene
|''(laughs)'' You are a ''riot!'' What brings you here? We don't normally get men this handsome around these parts.
|-
!Stan
|Heheh. Well, ''(looks at name tag) Darlene,'' between you and me, what I'm doing here is a little secret.
|-
!Darlene
|Oh, you seem like a man with secrets. ''(laughs with Stan)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh.
|-
!Darlene
|You know, I'm going on a break. You wanna take the sky tram up to Widow's Peak?
|-
!Stan
|''(whispers to Dipper)'' Take my advice or don't, but ''clearly'' I know what I'm doing.
|-
!Darlene
|(''takes Stan's offered arm and walks to the entrance with him)'' Oh, fancy!
|-
!Stan
|''(turns his head back to Dipper, grins, and points at Darlene)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel and Grenda watching from the bushes as Candy and Dipper enter Mummy Town U.S.A.''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh! I can't believe this is happening. A real date! I wonder what they'll name the baby.
|-
!Grenda
|If I had a baby, I would name it Grenda 2: The Sequel!
|-
!Mabel
|You would make such a good mother.
|-
!
|''Cut to inside Mummy Town U.S.A. Dipper and Candy are sitting on a bench. A banner above them reads "NEW MUMMIES DAILY".''
|-
!Candy
|This place is so enchanting.
|-
!Dipper
|Sort of confused by the phrase "New Mummies Daily," though. I mean, how does that even work?
|-
!Candy
|This mountain is full of mysteries. Like, why is my head falling on your shoulder? Beeyooop. ''(giggles as she places her head on Dipper's shoulder)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, yep! This is what I want! This is all part of the plan and stuff.
|-
![[Corn maze girl|Corn Maze Girl]]
|Oh, Dipper! Hey!
|-
!Dipper
|''(gasps)'' Corn Maze Girl!
|-
!Corn Maze Girl
|''(sits on bench)'' I was wondering when you'd call.
|-
!Candy
|Dipper, who is this?
|-
!Dipper
|Nobody! I mean, uh, ''somebody,'' but--
|-
!Emma Sue
|Dipper! ''(walks up)'' I didn't recognize you right-side up. You'll never guess where my mom gave birth. Hey, who are these girls?
|-
![[Log Land girl|Log Land Girl]]
|Dipper? ''(appears from behind the corner)'' Why haven't you called? Did our romantic log ride mean nothing to you?
|-
!Candy
|I can't believe it. You agreed to go on a date with me and you were seeing all these other girls?
|-
!Corn Maze Girl
|Well, answer us. Which one of us ''do'' you like?
|-
!Dipper
|I... ''(begins to sweat)'' I like all of you! I mean, I don't like any of you! I mean-- ''(pulls hat over face)'' I was trying to learn how to talk to girls! ''(laughs awkwardly)''
|-
!
|''Emma Sue, Log Land Girl, and Corn Maze Girl walk away in disgust.''
|-
!Log Land Girl
|Unbelievable.
|-
!Emma Sue
|So gross.
|-
!Corn Maze Girl
|What a jerk.
|-
!Candy
|Dipper Pines. ''(takes off glasses and rubs eyes)'' I thought you were a nice guy. But I guess you only care about yourself. ''(Puts on glasses and walks away)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, Candy, wait! Ugh, I messed everything up. I gotta find Stan! He'll know what to do! ''(runs away)''
|-
!
|''Stan and Darlene move to sit at a bench near the Giant Spider Forest.''
|-
!Darlene
|Oh, are you sure you wanna go this deep into the forest? It's so ''scaaary.''
|-
!Stan
|Heh, don't worry, toots. ''(puts arm around Darlene)'' That spider people stuff is just an urban legend. I can't believe people fall for it.
|-
!Darlene
|You're so brave.
|-
!Stan
|What can I say? I'm a real catch.
|-
!Darlene
|Yes. ''(blinks as her eyes turn black and her voice distorts)'' The catch of the day.
|-
!
|''The view pans up as Darlene changes in size, stopping on a giant statue of a spider.''
|-
!Stan
|Uh, I think your contacts fell out-- ''(screams)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Mystery Mountain entrance. Dipper runs to the information stand.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(panting)'' Uh, have you seen an old guy around here? Uh, big ears, orange nose, a real know-it-all?
|-
!Mystery Mountain Worker
|''(points to a Fire Retardant Raccoon animatronic)''
|-
!Fire Retardant Raccoon
|Ah, ah, ah! Flame Retardant Raccoon says: don't hug forest fires.
|-
!Dipper
|Ughhh. ''(walks to entrance)'' Stan, where are you? I need your advice! ''(hears static from the walkie-talkie and takes it out)'' Grunkle Stan?!
|-
!Stan
|''(from walkie-talkie:)'' Heeey, buddy boy. So remember how we were talking about my technique? Well, sometimes it leads to unexpected consequences.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah, you can say that again. Where ''are'' you?
|-
!Stan
|The good news is, I've solved the mystery of where Oregon's mummies come from. The bad news is...
|-
!
|''(Cuts to Stan in a cave, trapped in spider silk and hanging from the ceiling right-side up. He has the walkie-talkie lodged in-between his shoulder and his head.)''
|-
!Stan
|...I'm about to become one. Turns out Darlene is one of those spider people. But beyond that, the date's been okay.
|-
!
|''(Cut back to the Mystery Mountain entrance.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, wait, wait. Darlene's a spider person?! How is that ''possible?''
|-
!Stan
|''(in cave:)'' I don't know. One minute we're having the perfect date, and the next minute she's growing extra legs and encasing me in webbing. ''Women,'' right?
|-
!Dipper
|''(at entrance:)'' You couldn't tell she was a spider?!
|-
!Stan
|''(in cave:)'' I was blinded by flattery! Also, this acid she spit in my face. I'm up the mountain at Widow's Peak.
|-
!Dipper
|''(at entrance:)'' Alright, I'm gonna find you. Stay put!
|-
!Stan
|''(in cave:)'' ...You got it.
|-
!
|''Darlene shoots a string of webbing at Stan's walkie-talkie, bringing it to her. She walks toward Stan, half-spider in appearance.''
|-
!Darlene
|Ah, aaaah! Trying to escape? ''(throws walkie-talkie, breaking it)''
|-
!Stan
|You tricked me! I'm 80% certain you don't really love me at all!
|-
!Darlene
|Hah! Men will fall for anything. ''(sing-song)'' You so ''funny,'' great ''story,'' I ''love'' a man with shoulder hair!
|-
!Stan
|You--you didn't mean it about my shoulder hair?!
|-
!Darlene
|''(moves right next to Stan)'' Tell me, Stan. Before I transformed, who'd you think was in charge? You, with your cheesy lines and "fake confidence?" ''(walks away) I'm'' the master pickup artist here. Sorry, toots! This time, ''you're'' getting used for ''your'' body! Which, to my weird species, is food. Allow me to slip into something more horrifying.
|-
!
|''Darlene uses her legs to pull her mouth open and over the rest of her skin, folding up her human appearance and revealing the true spider underneath.''
|-
!Stan
|''(screams)''
|-
!Darlene
|I wonder what beverage pairs well with a vintage 70-something year old man? ''(walks away into the cave)'' Be right baaaack! ''(laughs evilly)''
|-
!Stan
|''(frantically)'' Come on, Dipper, where are you?
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel, Candy, and Grenda sitting at the Stump Bench.''
|-
!Candy
|I feel like such a fool. I should have known to guard my heart in a cage of ice.
|-
!Grenda
|There, there! Let my calming voice ''soothe you!''
|-
!Candy
|It is helping.
|-
!Dipper
|''(runs on-screen, panting)'' Girls! There you are.
|-
!Mabel
|Betrayer!
|-
!Candy
|Oh, you. What do you want?
|-
!Dipper
|I need your help.
|-
!Candy
|With what, some sick jealousy trap? ''(high-fives Mabel)''
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, sing it, Candy!
|-
!Grenda
|Testify!
|-
!Dipper
|Look, I'm so sorry about everything. But Stan's in trouble! You can totally kill me later, but right now he needs us. I'll explain on the way. ''(runs off-screen, with the girls following him)''
|-
!
|''(The kids walk up the trail, with Old Reliable going off in the background. They go past the Trambience as well. Cut to back in the cave.)''
|-
!Darlene
|''(off-screen:)'' Doo, do-doo, doo...
|-
!Stan
|''(praying)'' Please. I don't know if you're really up there or not, but if you are, please save me, Paul Bunyan!
|-
!Grenda
|''(off-screen:)'' Mr. Pines!
|-
!Stan
|Whoa, did that really work? ''(turns to see the kids running into the cave)''
|-
!Grenda
|''(yells as she tears up the silk holding Stan in place, making him fall to the ground)''
|-
!Stan
|Quick! Before the rest of the venom sets in!
|-
!
|''The kids tear the webbing off of Stan. They all run out of the cave, with Darlene at the entrance.''
|-
!Darlene
|No! Where are you? ''(runs after Stan)''
|-
!Candy
|The sky tram! Everybody on! I have a plan!
|-
!
|''The gang hops onto one of the trams on the Trambience.''
|-
!Mabel
|Haha, yes!
|-
!Grenda
|Perfect!
|-
!Stan
|Ride like the wind, sky tram!
|-
!
|''The tram is moving very slowly. A voice plays inside the tram.''
|-
!Recording
|Welcome to Trambience, the world's slowest treetop tram ride. Enjoy the sights at 0.1 miles per hour.
|-
!Grenda
|''(groans)'' Move, move, ''move! (begins stomping the floor with her feet)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, can't this thing go any faster?
|-
!Recording
|No it can't. This is Trambience.
|-
!
|''Darlene climbs up a pole holding the trams and looks for Stan's tram. She jumps down on several trams as she searches for it.''
|-
!Recording
|Enjoying the view? ''(a loud bang is heard on top of the tram)'' Take a picture!
|-
!
|''Darlene's head appears in the window, causing everyone to panic. She begins coating the tram in webbing.''
|-
!Stan
|We're doomed!
|-
!Dipper
|We're all gonna die!
|-
!Candy
|''(begins reading pamphlet)'' Listen carefully! This sky tram has an emergency drop switch. Below us is Oregon's largest Paul Bunyan statue! And Old Reliable goes off in 5... ''(looks at watch)'' 4... ''(grabs emergency drop switch)''
|-
!Dipper
|Candy, wait! Don't pull that lever! ''(Candy keeps counting down)''
|-
!Stan
|Kid, are you crazy?!
|-
!Candy
|Now! ''(pulls switch)''
|-
!
|''The tram is disconnected from the rail, sending it and Darlene down to the ground. An Old Reliable goes off, pushing the tram into the air. It bounces and rolls across Mystery Mountain, barreling through the ticket booth below the Paul Bunyan statue. Darlene is severed from the webbing and lies beneath the statue as its foot crashes down on her. She struggles to break free.''
|-
!Darlene
|My only weakness! A giant boot! A giant newspaper or a giant cup would've also been pretty bad.
|-
!
|''The door to the tram is pushed open. The gang stumbles out.''
|-
!Recording
|Thank you for riding Trambience sky tram! Tell your friends it was a boring, boring ride.
|-
!Stan
|''(to Candy:)'' Kid, that was ingenious! How'd you know that would work?
|-
!Candy
|Useless travel pamphlets.
|-
!Darlene
|''(weak)'' Staaaannnyyy... ''(she pulls her human head back on)'' I'm sorry. I dunno what came over me. You'll let me out, right?
|-
!Stan
|What?! After all that? Seriously, do I look like an amnesiac?
|-
!Darlene
|''(laughs)'' You're so funny. Have you ever considered becoming a comedian?
|-
!Stan
|You know, I actually have. Comedy is too subtle these days. My style involves more over-sized props. ''(walks to Darlene)'' Here, let me get you out from there--
|-
!
|''The kids pull Stan away from Darlene as she turns back into a spider and reaches out to bite him.''
|-
!Stan
|Oh, yeah. Right.
|-
!Darlene
|You win this round, Stan! But mark my words, as long as there's men like you out there, with their dumb one-liners and pickup moves, I'll never run out of prey! ''(spits acid at Stan's feet)''
|-
!Stan
|Aah! Get the car, get the car!
|-
!
|''The gang runs into the RV and drives away from Mystery Mountain. They get ready to go back to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(sighs and wipes the girls' numbers off of his arm)''
|-
!Stan
|''(sighs)'' Alright, kid. I gotta admit something. I'm no expert on women. Truth is, I've been divorced once, and slapped more times than I can remember. Confidence can buy you a lot, but at the end of the day, pickup artists tend to get our heads bitten off. When it comes to women, I'm a failure.
|-
!Dipper
|Hey. ''(points to arm)'' We're both failures. You know, even if your dating tips were bad, I actually haven't thought about Wendy all day. Plus, you did teach me to be more confident. I guess I just need to learn to use that power for good. ''(walks over to Candy, who is staring out the window)'' Hey. I found a pamphlet I don't think you've read yet. ''(hands Candy "A Loser's Attempt At An Apology")''
|-
!Candy
|''(Reads the pamphlet and smiles) ''It's okay, Dipper. The open road makes people do crazy things. Plus, after seeing you flee that spider like a baby, I kind of lost interest.
|-
!Dipper
|Yep! Yep. I deserve that.
|-
!
|''The RV enters [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]. The kids cheer.''
|-
!Dipper
|I still feel a little bad about wrecking those tourist traps.
|-
!Stan
|Ah, come on. Everyone loves my pranks! And the best part is, I never have to face any consequen--SWEET LORD!
|-
!
|''Stan stops the RV and gets out to see the owners of the tourist traps he pranked ruining the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Stan
|''Aw, come on!''
|-
!
|''A Corn Maze worker runs up and smashes one of the RV's headlights with a baseball bat.''
|-
![[Corn costume guy|Corn Maze Worker]]
|That's what you get! ''That's what you get! (runs away with the other tourist trap owners)''
|-
!Stan
|I don't understand. I completely don't deserve this.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, man. Are we gonna have to help clean this up?
|-
!Mabel
|Nah, I'm sure Soos will take care of it. Where is Soos, anyway?
|-
!
|''Credits: Soos is still in the Corn Maze.''
|-
!Soos
|Okay, Soos. Remember what your [[Abuelita|grandma]] taught you. When you get lost, stay exactly where you are, and ''don't move. (pause) Don't...move...! (pause)'' You know, I would make a really good scarecrow.
|-
!
|''End.''

|-
!Dipper Pines
|''(Wakes up and screams)''
|-
![[Mabel Pines]]
|''(As Mr. Upside-Downington:)'' Mornin', Dipper, guess who!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, what joy. If it isn't Mr. Upside-Downington. How long's it been? Third grade, maybe?
|-
!Mabel
|That's right. And I'm here to deliver you an upside-downington-tastic message!
|-
!Dipper
|Is it the message that we're getting too old for this sort of thing?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Normal voice:)'' Um, kinda, actually. It's that we are exactly one week away from our 13th birthday!
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! Our birthday's coming up already? ''(Gasps)'' Soon we're gonna be actual teenagers!
|-
!Mabel
|Finally! I can stop reading preteen magazines and start reading ''post''-preteen magazines.
|-
!Dipper
|PG-13 movies, here I come!
|-
!Mabel
|And just one more year until high school. High school, Dipper! Where girls become women and they teach us stuff about... ''(Turns Dipper around and whispers:)'' You know what.
|-
!Dipper
|Trigonometry?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh yeah, baby!
|-
!
|''[[Stan Pines]] and [[Soos Ramirez]] enter the room.''
|-
!Stan
|That's not the only good news coming up! In one week my senior citizen's ponytail kit is coming in the mail. I'm...I'm kinda going through some things.
|-
!Soos
|In one week, my [[Abuelita|grandma]] is finally letting me eat crackers on my bed! The future is coming for us all, dudes.
|-
!Stan
|The future.
|-
!Dipper
|The future!
|-
!Mabel
|The future!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Laughs)'' I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously with that face on your chin.
|-
!Mabel
|''(As Mr. Upside-Downington:)'' What face, Dipper?
|-
!Dipper
|You're--You're doing the voice so you obviously know what I'm talking about--
|-
!Mabel
|Bi bon't bnow bhat bou're balking about.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Dipper
|There is something wrong with you.
|-
!Mabel
|There's something wrong with both of us.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Cut to the living room of the [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, party planners. In one week we become teenagers, and our summer vacation winds to an end. So we need to throw the greatest party of all time! I'm talking piñatas with tinier piñatas inside.
|-
!Soos
|Boom, dreams comin' true! ''(Pours little piñatas into a large piñata)''
|-
!Mabel
|I'm talking inviting everyone in town. Let's see, where do we stand with the [[gnomes]]?
|-
!Stan
|Not so fast, goofus and girl-goofus. ''(Walks into the room)'' After that [[Scary-oke|zombie incident]], no one's throwing another party at my house. I keep finding little bits of the [[the Undead|undead]] in the couch cushions. ''(Finds an arm under the chair cushion)''
|-
!Mabel
|But Grunkle Stan, we need some roof to raise.
|-
!Soos
|Dude, you could rent out the [[Gravity Falls High School]] gym, and have your party there. That place is empty all summer long.
|-
!Mabel
|The gym's a great idea, Soos. To the high school!
|-
!
|''The entire house quakes, startling everyone.''
|-
![[Ford Pines]]
|''(Off screen)'' Dipper, my face is on fire!
|-
!Dipper
|I'll just be a sec. ''(Runs into Ford's room)'' Great Uncle Ford, are you okay?
|-
!Ford
|''(Wiping off his face, which is smoking, with a towel)'' Oh yes, I'm fine. I just said that to make sure you'd come in here quickly.
|-
!Dipper
|But your face ''is'' on fire.
|-
!Ford
|Yes, it's much faster than shaving. Now, listen, Dipper. I have a very important mission, and you are the only one who can help me. ''(Pulls out the rift)'' Remember the [[Interdimensional rift|rift]] in dimensional space-time I showed you? It's cracking. ''(Points at crack)'' This is what [[Bill Cipher|Bill]] has been waiting for. If it breaks, it will cause reality as we know it to completely unravel. A hypothetical and catastrophic event I call [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]].
|-
!
|''Dipper stares at a blackboard Ford has drawn up, detailing the finer points of Weirdmageddon.''
|-
!Ford
|Bill is out there, and he'd use any trick, from deception to outright possession, to make this happen. But for the sake of humanity, we mustn't let it.
|-
!Dipper
|What do we do?
|-
!Ford
|We patch the rift. I'll explain on the way. ''(Locks the rift in a protective case)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, what about Mabel?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Standing in the doorway)'' It's okay, Dipper. You should totally go with Grunkle Ford to save the world or whatever.
|-
!Dipper
|Are you sure?
|-
!Mabel
|We're going to be doing birthday junk all week. Plus, I packed us walky-talkies. Here's one for my party mission, and one for your smarty mission. ''(Laughs with Dipper)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Clears throat)'' I did mention that the fate of the universe is at stake, didn't I? Hurry, we haven't much time. ''(Leaves)''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, Dipper. It's your first big mission with Ford. A chance to prove yourself. Don't mess this up. ''(Runs and hits the wall)'' Ow! Ah, heh heh, I'm alright. ''(Laughs, then runs out and trips)'' Ahh!
|-
!
|''Cut to Gravity Falls High School, where [[Nate]] and [[Lee]] are messing with its sign, which says "SAWDUST INHALATION DRILL- 8:00. GO FIGHTING BEAVERS." Mabel and Soos walk inside to see the gym filled with students.''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, Soos, I thought you said this place was empty.
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|My dawgs, what up?
|-
!Mabel
|Wendy, what are you doing here?
|-
!Wendy
|Ugh, high school registration.
|-
!Mabel
|Ooh! You know I'm only a year away from high school myself. Would you say your experience is more rom-com, or wacky romp?
|-
!Wendy
|More like teen horror movie. High school is the worst. Classes get super hard, your body just flat out turns against you, and worst of all, everybody hates you.
|-
!
|''Cut to two girls growling at each other, then pan to Thompson and Robbie.''
|-
![[Thompson]]
|Can't do it! Can't do another year!
|-
![[Robbie Valentino|Robbie]]
|My hormones are like a sweaty cage! ''(Punches bulletin board)''
|-
!Mabel
|Why aren't they singing about following their dreams? TV taught me that high school was like some sort of musical.
|-
!Wendy
|TV lied, man! If you could avoid growing up, do it. I'd give anything to be 12 again. Anyway, what are you guys doing here?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Chuckles, sadly:)'' Oh, just looking for a place to have my 13th birthday party.
|-
!Teacher
|Wendy...Borduroy? I-I mean Corduroy?
|-
!
|''All the students laugh at Wendy.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Blushes red) ''See what I mean? ''(walks to teacher)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Exits the gym; on the walkie talkie:)'' Master Mabel to Dippidy Dog. We can have our party at the gym, but we gotta talk about high school. Starting to think it might not be the awesome future we were expecting. Over.
|-
!Dipper
|''(On the walkie talkie:)'' I'm going through a bad patch, Mabel. We'll talk when I get back.
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper? Come in, come in?
|-
!Soos
|Hey, I know what'll make you feel better. Let's deliver some invites to your friends, huh?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah!
|-
!
|''Mabel and Soos drive away. Mabel finds that the sign now reads "NO ESCAPE." Cut to Dipper and Ford walking to the Floating Cliffs.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To the walkie talkie:)'' Mabel? Mabel, you there? Ugh.
|-
!Ford
|Listen, Dipper. In order to seal the rift for good, it's going to take an [[adhesive]] stronger than anything on earth. Something...extraterrestrial in origin.
|-
!Dipper
|W-What do you mean?
|-
!Ford
|Dipper, look at the peculiar shape made by those cliffs. Does it remind you of anything?
|-
!Dipper
|Hmm...
|-
!Ford
|''(Jingles his UFO key chain and holds it up over the cliffs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps quietly)'' Shut. up.
|-
!Ford
|According to my research, the entire valley of [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] was formed when an [[Crash Site Omega|extraterrestrial object]] crash-landed here millions of years ago. Did this craft cause the town's strange properties? Or, did the town's strange properties attract the craft? The answer is still unknown.
|-
!Dipper
|But, that's crazy! Where did the saucer go?
|-
!Ford
|Sometimes the strangest things in the world are right under our noses. ''(pushes rock away, revealing underground entrance)'' And our feet, in this particular instance. Now you might wanna stand back. This [[Magnet guns|magnet gun]] can rip the fillings out of a man's mouth from 100 feet.
|-
!Dipper.
|''(backs away a few steps as Ford detaches the opening)'' Whoa!
|-
!Ford
|I used to raid this thing for parts for years. Where do you think I got the materials to build my [[Universe portal|portal]]?
|-
!Dipper
|You...I...words... not working for mouth.
|-
!Ford
|Now come. Take this. ''(throws Dipper a magnet gun)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Scrambling to catch the magnet gun)'' Whoa, whoa!
|-
!Ford
|Don't worry, I've been down here countless times; all the aliens have been dead for millions of years. ''(Starts climbing down but then pops up) ''Probably.
|-
!
|''Dipper takes a deep breath and heads down the entrance. Cut to commercial.''
|-
!Dipper
|I can't believe there's been a giant [[Crash Site Omega|UFO]] under the town this whole time.
|-
!Ford
|I wish my mind could be where yours is right now, Dipper. When confirmation of extraterrestrials still had that punch. Now it's just sort of "eh." [[Old Man McGucket|McGucket]] and I used to come down here all the time to raid their tech and study their language.
|-
!Dipper
|This is so cool! ''(Takes a selfie with some of the alien symbols and laughs)''
|-
!Ford
|The substance we need to seal the rift is an [[Adhesive|alien adhesive]]. Strong enough to keep the hull of a spacecraft together. Just one dollop of this adhesive should be enough to seal a crack in space-time. Also, if it touches you it will seal up all the orifices in your face, ''(cocks gun)'' so try to avoid that. Now, use your magnet gun and follow me. Hup! ''(Uses magnet gun to climb down a pillar)''
|-
!Dipper
|Great Uncle Ford!
|-
!Ford
|Your turn! Say "hup"! It helps!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Releases a deep breath)'' Okay. Just turn on magnet, leap down hole. Turn on... ''(fiddles with gun)'' C'mon already. ''(gun whirs to life)'' Magnet. ''(grunts as he jumps)'' Ah! ''(crashes onto the ceiling)'' A little help?
|-
!
|''Cut to Grenda's house. Mabel knocks on her front door.''
|-
![[Grenda]]
|Oh hi, Mabel! You're just in time for our 1 o'clock boy talk.
|-
!Mabel
|If you think that's good...Boom! Me and Dipper's 13th birthday jam!
|-
!Grenda
|Aw, man. Your birthday's on the last day of summer? I'm not gonna be here.
|-
!Mabel
|What?
|-
!Grenda
|[[Marius von Fundshauser|Marius]] is flying me out to Austria to hang out in his castle or whatever that week. He's so clingy!
|-
!Mabel
|You're gonna be out of town for my birthday? But at least you can come, right, Candy?
|-
![[Candy]]
|Sorry, Mabel. My parents send me to music camp this time of year. There is no escape from music camp.
|-
!Mabel
|So neither of you are gonna be at my birthday party? And you won't be able to wish me goodbye at the end of the summer?
|-
!Candy
|I'm sorry, Mabel.
|-
!Grenda
|Summer happened so fast. ''(Answers phone:)'' Ugh, Marius! Now's not the time!
|-
!Mabel
|I think I need to radio for emotional back-up. ''(To walkie-talkie:)'' Dipper, please come in. Our party mission is going down in flames. Over. ''(Static on the walkie talkie; sighs)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Ford underground.''
|-
!Ford
|This is their storage facility. This place would've been heavily guarded, but now everything's defunct. Go ahead, flip any switch. They've all been busted for millions of years.
|-
!
|''Dipper pushes a button and it causes a [[Petting Zoo|petting zoo]] to fall down a hole.''
|-
![[Sprott]]
|''(To a cow behind him:)'' Clara, did you eat my farm?
|-
!Clara
|''(Moos)''
|-
!
|''Cut back to Dipper and Ford.''
|-
!Ford
|The glue should be around here somewhere, so keep your eyes peeled. Dipper, let me ask you something. Have you thought much about your future?
|-
!Dipper
|No, not really. I mean, beyond graduating high school with a high GPA so I can get accepted to a good technical college with a photography and media production minor to start my own ghost hunting show.
|-
!Ford
|Ha, heh heh! It's like talking to a younger version of myself. If you're so sure of what you want out of life, why wait? Why put up with the drudgery of school?
|-
!Dipper
|Heh. Trust me, I'd love to fast-forward the whole thing, but it's not like I have a choice.
|-
!Ford
|Dipper, I've been thinking. I'm getting too old to investigate Gravity Falls on my own. I need to train an apprentice to help me fight monsters, solve mysteries, and protect this town. And I think I'd--I'd like to keep it in the family.
|-
!Dipper
|What are you saying?
|-
!Ford
|I've read your additions to my [[Journal 3|journal]] and I'm impressed with your potential. What would you say to staying in Gravity Falls after the summer ends and becoming my apprentice?
|-
!Dipper
|W-what about school?
|-
!Ford
|Dipper, I have 12 PhDs. Your parents would be thrilled I could give you such an advanced education.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' There's also Mabel. She'd be all alone in California.
|-
!Ford
|Mabel will be fine on her own. She has a magnetic personality. I watched her become pen pals with the pizza delivery man in the 60 seconds he was at the door.
|-
!Dipper
|Gosh, we've never really been apart before.
|-
!Ford
|And isn't it suffocating? Dipper, can you honestly tell me you never felt like you were meant for something more?
|-
!Dipper
|I-I dunno. Sounds like a dream come true, but I'm not sure I have what it takes. I was tricked by Bill, I was wrong about Stan's portal. Heck, I can't even operate this magnet gun right. ''(Turns on the magnet gun and it sucks up a piece of metal. As Dipper tries to get it free, something pink seeps out of it)''
|-
!Ford
|Ha! Yes! Dipper, you've found the adhesive!
|-
!Dipper
|I did?!
|-
!Ford
|Hoho, you really did it, kid. Huddle in, let's get a picture of this. ''(Hears something and holds up gun)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Whispering:)'' Uh, Grunkle Ford, you said everything in here is dead, right?
|-
!Ford
|Yes. Unless somehow we've reactivated the- ''(gasps)'' security system!
|-
!
|''The [[Security Droids|security droids]] emerge.''
|-
!Dipper
|What do we do?!
|-
!Ford
|Listen to me very carefully: I've studied these; they're security droids and they detect adrenaline. You simply have to not feel any fear and they won't see you.
|-
!Dipper
|''What?!''
|-
!Ford
|It's okay. I've done it before. Just take a deep breath, focus on your intellect, and control your fear.
|-
!Dipper
|Huh-wha-wha-wha- that's crazy! I-
|-
!Ford
|Follow my lead!
|-
!Dipper
|Great Uncle Ford!
|-
!Ford
|Focus, Dipper!
|-
!
|''The droid measures Ford's heartbeat and finds it to be calm. It moves on to Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|Wha- I-uh. I-I-uh...
|-
!
|''The droid produces a gun.''
|-
!Dipper
|I can't!
|-
!Ford
|Get down! ''(Tackles Dipper, dodging the flash from the gun; stands up and shoots the droid, destroying it, but Ford gets hit with a flash)''
|-
!
|''The other droid produces arms and drags Ford toward it.''
|-
!Ford
|Uh! No! Noooooo!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, no! ''(Runs after him but trips)''
|-
!Ford
|Stay back! It's too dangerous! Sealing the rift is what's important now! Take this! ''(Slides the rift to Dipper)''
|-
!
|''The droid traps Ford in itself.''
|-
!Ford
|You're gonna have to do it without me! Use the adhesive! Fix the rift! Save the universe, Dipper!
|-
!
|''The droid flies away into the tunnels.''
|-
!Dipper
|Great Uncle Ford! ''(Chases the droid through the tunnels)'' Hang on, I'm coming for you! ''(Puts the rift in his backpack)'' Don't worry! I'll get you out of there!
|-
!
|''The droid disappears behind a saucer-shaped door.''
|-
!Dipper
|Where is that thing taking you?!
|-
!
|''The room glows purple and some kind of map appears.''
|-
!Ford
|''(Offscreen)'' It's an automated prison droid! And wherever it's going, I'm not coming back!
|-
!Dipper
|What?! ''(Gasps as the ceiling opens to outside)''
|-
!
|''Arm carries Ford toward the opening.''
|-
!Dipper
|No, no, no... don't worry, I'll think of something! ''(Runs after Ford)''
|-
!Ford
|Dipper! What on Earth are you doing?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Puts duct tape around the magnet gun)'' Hold on, Great Uncle Ford.
|-
!
|''The droid Ford is in hovers below the exit.''
|-
!Dipper
|I'm getting you out of this, one way or another! ''(Tries to fire the gun but it doesn't work)'' Oh no! ''(Punches the gun, which has sparks flickering around it)''
|-
!
|''The alien countdown appears to be at zero.''
|-
!Dipper
|Come on, come on! ''(The gun turns on and magnets Dipper to Ford's droid)''
|-
!
|''The droid blasts away.''
|-
!Dipper
|AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!
|-
!
|''The droid breaks through a grate and is outside, flying high into the air.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Hat falls off, grunting, pounds the droid)'' Let go of my uncle! ''(Screams as the droid shakes and beeps)''
|-
!
|''The droid, as Dipper screams, swerves around, flies through the crack in the cliff, through the waterfall and through the [[Gravity Falls water tower|water tower]]. The droid bumps, knocking Ford unconscious.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah! Great Uncle Ford! Okay, let's try: magnet pulse! ''(Turns a knob on the gun) Waaaaaaahhhh!''
|-
!
|''The droid crashes into the woods. Dipper is lying behind it, bruised and moaning.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps and runs to the droid)'' Oh no! ''(Pounding on the glass)'' Oh no no no no! ''(Opens the window and runs in to Ford, who is still unconscious)'' Come on, wake up, man! ''(Drags him out)'' We gotta get out of here before-
|-
!
|''Another droid is behind them. It begins to scan Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, uh, I'm warning you! I have a magnet gun!
|-
!
|''The droid produces a large gun.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh yeah!? You think you can scare me!? Do your worst! Nothing in this universe is gonna take away my uncle! So go ahead! Give me what you've got!
|-
!
|''The machine measures Dipper's heartbeat, finds it normal, retracts its gun, and turns off.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pants)''
|-
!Ford
|Ahahaha! Oh- ''(coughs)'' Oh, I thought I was a goner, kid. ''(coughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs to him)'' Oh, are you alright? What happened?
|-
!Ford
|''(Leaning on Dipper)'' The- the orb didn't detect any chemical signs of fear. It- it assumed the threat was neutralized and self-disassembled. Hahaha!
|-
!Dipper
|I- I did it?
|-
!Ford
|You did it.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks over to the droid)''
|-
!Ford
|This is what I was talking about. How many other twelve-year-olds do you think are capable of doing what you've just done. ''(Nods)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel in the attic looking at scrapbooks.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sighs)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Walks in)'' Hey, everything all right, pumpkin?
|-
!Mabel
|Just can't believe the summer's almost over. And now that I know how awful high school's going to be, I'm in no hurry to start that train wreck.
|-
!Stan
|''(Puts his arm around her shoulder)'' Ah, nobody likes gettin' older. But just because you're growing doesn't mean you have to ''grow up'', you know? I mean, look at me. I'm pushin' seventy and I ''still'' eat ice cream for dinner.
|-
!Mabel
|But I don't wanna say goodbye to Gravity Falls.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, at least whatever happens after this summer, you'll still have your brother along with you through thick and thin. Not everyone can say that, you know. ''(Noogies her and leaves)''
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, at least when I go home I always have Dipper. ''(Picks up a picture of Dipper)'' Good ol', reliable ol'-
|-
!
|''Her walkie-talkie crackles.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Faint, over walkie-talkie:)'' Are you okay?
|-
!Ford
|''(Faint, over walkie-talkie:)'' I'm fine.
|-
!Dipper
|Let's get you out of there.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Ford.''
|-
!Ford
|Listen to me, Dipper: this town is a magnet for things that are special. And that includes you and me. It brought both of us here for a purpose! Stay here with me, Dipper. Become my apprentice. Don't let anyone hold you- ''(coughs)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Offers him his hand)'' I'll do it; I'm gonna stay.
|-
!Ford
|Excellent. ''(Grabs Dipper's hand and climbs out of the ditch)'' Now who wants to save the world, apprentice?
|-
!Dipper and Ford
|''(Walk away laughing)''
|-
!
|''Dipper's walkie-talkie makes static noises.''
|-
!
|''Cut to the attic.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Comes in)'' Mabel! I just had the best day of my life! UFOs are real and there's one under the town and I saved Great Uncle Ford's life and- and... ''(Sees that Mabel is lying on her bed with her back to him, unmoving)'' Hey, are you okay?
|-
!Mabel
|Tell me it's not true, Dipper. Tell me you were joking. ''(Holds up the walkie-talkie, which emits static)'' Ford's apprentice? Seriously?
|-
!Dipper
|Look, I was thinking and... this is a huge opportunity for me.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Crying)'' Well it's a horrible opportunity ''for me!'' I had the worst day of my life! When we turn thirteen, the summer ends, and I have to leave everything behind. You're the only person I can count on and now ''you're'' leaving me ''too''!?
|-
!Dipper
|Look, I've been thinking about it. I won't be gone forever, okay? I'll still visit you at home, and we'll chat online; we'll make it work.
|-
!Mabel
|I don't want it to work. I just wish summer could last forever.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Walks over to her and puts his arm on her)'' But it can't, Mabel. Look, things aren't gonna stay frozen this way. It's part of growing up. Things change. Summer ends.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Yells and runs away)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah! ''(Falls over, as he was leaning on her)'' Mabel, wait! I didn't mean it like that! Mabel, come back!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs into the woods crying; sits under a tree, digs through the backpack)'' Only party chocolate can cheer me up now. ''(Holds up a notebook)'' Nerd books? ''(Holds up pens)'' Chewed up pens? Ugh, wrong backpack. Not fair. I just wish summer could last forever. ''(Pulls her sweater over herself)''
|-
!Bill Cipher
|''(Possessing [[Blendin Blandin]]; offscreen)'' That might be possible!
|-
!Mabel
|Sweatertown is ''not'' accepting incoming calls right now.
|-
!Bill
|M-M-M-Mabel, it's me.
|-
!Mabel
|What? Who said that?
|-
!Bill
|''(Walks up to her, adjusting camoflauge suit)'' I-I-I can help.
|-
!Mabel
|The time travel guy? What are you doing here?
|-
!Bill
|You said you don't want summer to end, right? D-did-did I hear that right?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah... why are you asking?
|-
!Bill
|Look, maybe it's against the rules, but you once did a favor for me, so I thought I could help you out. It's called a time bubble, and it prevents time from going forward. Summer in Gravity Falls can last as long as you want it to!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Wipes up tears)'' R-Really? But how does it work?
|-
!Bill
|I just need you to get a little gizmo for me from your uncle. ''(Wristwatch displays the rift)'' It's something small. He won't even know it's missing.
|-
!Mabel
|Huh. Maybe Dipper has something like that in his nerd-bag.
|-
!
|''Cut to Ford in the lab. Dipper walks in.''
|-
!Ford
|Let me guess: Mabel didn't take it well?
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know, maybe I'm making the wrong decision. I need to think about this.
|-
!Ford
|Dipper, right now we need to focus on the mission. Now come on, I've got the glue; hand me the rift and let's make history.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reaches into bag and pulls out birthday flyer)'' What? Oh no! The RIFT!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel in the woods.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pulls the rift out of the backpack)'' Huh. That's... odd. This it?
|-
!Bill
|Yes, that's it! Just hand it over and I'll do my thing. Unless you're ready to leave Gravity Falls.
|-
!Mabel
|Just a little more summer. ''(Gives it to him)''
|-
!Bill
|Oops. ''(Drops it and stomps on it, breaking it)''
|-
!Mabel
|What?!
|-
!Bill
|''(Laughs maniacally, takes off goggles to reveal his eyes)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh no! Wait, wait wait!
|-
!Bill
|''(Snaps fingers, making Mabel fall unconscious; leaves Blendin's body)'' At last! At long, long last! The gateway between worlds has opened! The event ''one billion years prophesized'' has finally come to pass! The day has come! ''The world is finally mine! (Laughs maniacally as the rift tears reality into the [[Nightmare Realm]])''
|-
!
|''Townspeople look on, worried. Wind blows. Dipper and Ford run out of the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|What's going on?! What is that?!
|-
!Ford
|We're too late! It's the end of the world.
|-
!Bill
|''(Rises up, cackling maniacally)''
|-
!
|''Zoom into Bill's eye; end credits: Dipper and Mabel's birthday flyer sits on the ground as lightning crackles and screams are heard. A helicopter is heard above and the flyer blows away.''

|Oh, it's happening. It's finally finally happening! ''(Continues laughing as what appears to be muscle fiber covers him)'' Physical form? Don't mind if I DO! ''(Is encased in a metal pyramid and vanishes) ''

![[Blendin Blandin]]
|Huh?! What just happened? ''(As [[Mabel Pines]] is lifted up and locked into a [[Prison Bubble|bubble]] with her [[Zodiac|shooting star symbol]] on it)'' Oh. Oh man. This is bad! This is real bad! Guys, we've got a situation! ''(Presses a button on his watch, causing him to vanish)''

|-
![[Tyler Cutebiker]]
|''(Gasps)''
|-
![[Lazy Susan]]
|Wha?
|-
!Bill
|''(Laughs, deep voice:)'' Alright, listen up you one lifespan, three dimensional, five sense skin puppets! ''(Normal voice:)'' For one trillion years I've been trapped in my own decaying dimension, waiting for a new universe to call my own. Name's Bill! But you can call me your new lord and master for all of eternity! ''(Melts the statue of [[Nathaniel Northwest]])''
|-
!Blubs, Durland, and Tyler
|Ah!
|-
!Bill
|Now meet the gang of interdimensional criminals and nightmares I call my friends. ''(As they come out of the scar in the sky)'' [[8 Ball]]! [[Kryptos]]! The being whose name must never be said! Haha, what the heck. It's [[Zanthar]]. Then of course there's also [[Teeth]], [[Keyhole]], [[Hectorgon]], [[Amorphous Shape]], [[Pyronica]], [[Paci-Fire]], and [[Eye-Bats|these guys]]. This is our town now, boys!
|-
!
|''Bill and his friends laugh.''
|-
!Tyler
|Now see here, you unholy triangle fella. As mayor, I strongly urge you to git...git on out of here.
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Yeah! Things with one eye are weird!
|-
![[Grenda]]
|We don't like out-of-towners.
|-
![[Manly Dan]]
|We punch what we DON'T UNDERSTAND!! ''(Rips open mailbox)''
|-
![[Preston Northwest]]
|I would just like to say that as a rich capitalist I welcome your tyrannical rule. Perhaps I could be one of your, uh... horsemen of the apocalypse?
|-
![[Pacifica Northwest]]
|Dad!
|-
!Preston
|Not now, sweetie, the grownups are talking.
|-
!Bill
|Oh wow, that's a great offer. How 'bout instead I shuffle the functions of every hole in your face? ''(Snaps fingers; Preston's face becomes mixed up)''
|-
!Preston
|''(Falls over, screaming as his family watches in horror)''

|-
![[Eye-Bats|Eye-Bat]]
|''(Takes Durland away)''
|-
!Bill
|It's time we do a little redecorating. I could really use a ''castle'' of some kind. ''(A [[Fearamid|pyramid]] forms in the sky)'' And how about some [[Weirdness Bubbles|bubbles of PURE MADNESS]]! ''(Colorful bubbles appear)''
|-
!
|''A bubble passes through [[Sprott]], who rips off his shirt and screams madly.''

|Mabel! The rift must have cracked inside her backpack. She must be in danger. I have to go find her. ''(Running, to the walkie talkie:)'' Mabel! Come in, Mabel! Mabel!
|-
!Ford
|''(Stops him)'' Dipper. Listen to me. We can find your sister soon, but first we have to stop Bill. If we can blast him back through the rift he came out of, we just might be able to stop him before his weirdness spreads across the entire globe.
|-
!Dipper
|Are you sure defeating Bill is even possible?
|-
!Ford
|No. I'm not sure. But being a hero means fighting back even when it seems impossible. Will you follow me?
|-
!Dipper
|To the ends of the Earth.
|-
!Ford
|Good. Because that's where we're heading. You also might want to step inside.
|-
!Dipper and Ford
|''(Run inside)''

!Gnome
|Weirdness wave!
|-
!
|''The wave washes over the Mystery Shack and over [[Abuelita's house|Soos' house]], causing the barbecue to come to life and run away.''
|-
![[Soos]]
|''(From window)'' Ah! Abuelita! A tidal wave of madness just went over us!
|-
![[Abuelita]]
|''(Offscreen)'' Oh, Soos, such an imagination.
|-
!Soos
|''(Turns around and sees that Abuelita is a chair)'' Ah! You've turned into a chair!
|-
!Abuelita
|Why don't you have a seat and relax?
|-
!Soos
|But what about you? And my friends?
|-
!Abuelita
|I'll be fine. You go help the others.
|-
!Soos
|When the universe is broken, only one handyman can fix it. ''(Kisses Abuelita and runs off)'' I'm coming for you, friends!
|-
!Abuelita
|Time for a nap. ''(Reclines)''

|''Cut to Stan nailing a sign to a tree.''

|''(Tears off the tassel and eats it)''
|-
!Stan
|That's it, goat! It's time I threw you off this property for good!

|Ha! Freedom! Freedom to PUNCH! ''(Punches the air)''
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gravity Falls Maximum Security Prison]].''
|-
![[Prison Counselor]]
|Okay, inmates, time to review your finger paintings. ''(Looking at paintings)'' Good. Nice. ''(Gasps when he sees Gideon's painting, which is a torn paper with a knife in it and "Revenge" written on it and "Love" written next to a picture of Mabel; the man sighs)'' [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]], does this look like someone who's ready to re-enter society?
|-
![[Ghost-Eyes]]
|Gideon's unappreciated in his time!
|-
!Gideon
|Oh, Ghost-Eyes, you're making me blush!
|-

|-
!Ford
|''(Fires, but only hits Bill's hat)'' Oh no!!

!Bill
|''(Hat heals)'' Well, well, well, and here I thought today couldn't get any BETTER. ''(Fires a beam at the tower, destroying it)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Lying in the wreckage, bruised)'' Great uncle Ford!
|-
!Ford
|''(Trapped under some wreckage, grunts)'' Dipper! Take my journals! ''(Slides the backpack to Dipper, who picks up [[Journal 3]])'' Listen, I know of one other way to defeat Bill, it's- ''(Hears something behind him)'' Oh, no! Dipper! Run! Get down!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs down the stair)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Rises behind Ford with the six-fingered hand symbol in his eye)'' Good old six-fingers. I've been waiting an ''(Deep voice:)'' ETERNITY ''(Normal voice:)'' to have a chat face to face. ''(Lifts Ford up)''
|-
!Ford
|Wah!
|-
!Bill
|Everyone, this armageddon wouldn't be possible without help from our friend here. Give him a six-fingered hand!

!Bill's friends
|''(Offscreen, Clap and cheer)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Comes around the corner of the clock tower)''
|-
!Bill
|This brainiac is the one who built the portal in the first place! Now don't look so sour, Fordsy. It's not too late to join me. With that extra finger, you'd fit right in with my freaks.
|-
!Ford
|I'll die before I join you! I know your weakness, Bill!
|-
!Bill
|Oh, yeah? ''(Eye becomes a question mark)'' And I know a riddle. Why did the old man do this? ''(Assumes a pose)''
|-
!Ford
|This? ''(Imitates Bill's pose)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Shoots a laser at Ford, petrifying him)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gasps)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Picks up Ford)'' Because I needed a new backscratcher! ''(Laughs with his friends as he scratches himself with Ford)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Growls)'' That's ''enough! (Comes out from behind building)'' Hand over my uncle! Or else! ''(Holds up Journal 3)''
|-
!Bill
|Now isn't. This. ''(Flies up to Dipper and his eye glows white; with a deep voice along with his normal voice:)'' INTERESTING? ''(Normal voice:)'' My old puppet is back for an encore. You think ''you'' can stop me? ''(Punches the air)'' Go ahead, Pine Tree, show me what you've got.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flipping through 3 and shining blacklight on it)'' I...uh... I... uh... ''(Sees that the Journal says "IF HE GAINS PHYSICAL FORM THEN ALL IS LOST!")''
|-
!Bill
|I UM I. Do it, kid. Do some ''brilliant'' thing that takes me down right now. Whattdya got, Pine Tree, everyone's waiting. DO IT.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Jumps at Bill) ''Augh, BILL! ''(His fist hits a force field in front of Bill's eye and he is thrown backward into a tree; he rubs his head)'' Ugh...

|-
!Dipper
|NO!! THE JOURNALS!!
|-
!Bill
|Not much of a threat now, ''are you? (To his friends:)'' Now can anyone remind me why we came here?
|-
!8 Ball
|To get WEIRD!
|-
!Bill
|THAT'S RIGHT! VIP party at the [[Fearamid]]. Oh, and 8 Ball, Teeth, you've earned a treat, have the kid for a snack.
|-
!Dipper
|Huh?
|-
!8 Ball
|''(Rolls eyes)''
|-
!Teeth
|Heheheheh.

!Bill
|''(Drives away, firing lasers, changing things as he goes, laughing maniacally)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Stares at 8 Ball and Teeth, panting)''
|-
!8 Ball
|So, you wanna eat him, or, something?
|-
!Teeth
|Oh, definitely, let's eat him.
|-
!Dipper
|Ahhhhh!!! ''(Runs away as they follow him)''
|-
![[Shandra Jimenez]]
|''(On TV, which is lying among the wreckage)'' We are day three in this strange cataclysmic event, which some are calling "Weirdmageddon," or the "Oddpocalypse." Weather today calls for black clouds, blood rain and frequent showers of Eyeball Bats turning people into stone. I'm Shandra Jimenez, and I ate a rat for dinner.
|-
!Eye-Bat
|''(Turns [[Pizza Guy]] into stone and carries him away)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Gets out from under some garbage bag and sees an Eyeball Bat following him)'' Huh! ''(Runs into an alley; into walkie talkie:)'' Mabel, it's me. So far I have eluded capture but I haven't been able to find you or Stan anywhere. I don't know if you can hear me, but wherever you are, whatever happens, I'm going to find you.
|-
![[Pterodactyl]]
|''(Screeches and takes the "A" out of "MALLS" on the [[Gravity Malls|Gravity Malls']] sign)''
|-
!Dipper
|The mall! Maybe they're hiding in there! ''(Runs to the mall and runs into the glass)'' Oh no!
|-
![[The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity]]
|Hey. Hey you. Hey, I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you about going inside my mouth. I- I think you wanna get in here. ''(Crawling toward Dipper)'' Hey, you, hey! I'm talkin' to you, man! You don't have to make a big deal outta this! Hello! HELLO!
|-
!Dipper
|''(As he talks, forces himself through the mall's automatic doors, but gets stuck in them)''
|-
!The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity
|''(Slaps the door, freeing Dipper)'' Why are you just ignoring me? ''(Reaches inside)'' That's seriously rude to just IGNORE someone like this.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Backs into the food court)'' Stan! Mabel! ''(Sees nachos on a table)'' Huh, maybe at least I can get something to eat. The last nachos on Earth. ''(Picks them up and is trapped in a net)'' Ah! HELP! The nachos tricked me!
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy]]
|''(Pokes her head out from a plant)'' Dipper?
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy!? Oh no! You've been transformed into some sort of... tree monster!
|-
!Wendy
|Ha! It's just camouflage. My dad made me and [[Corduroy brothers|my brothers]] do apocalypse training every year instead of Christmas. Guess it's sort of cool the paranoia paid off. ''(Shoots a bat) Nice!'' Bat meat. Let me get that for ya. ''(Throws ax at the net, freeing Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ah! Wendy, I'm so glad to find you! ''(Hugs her)'' I thought everyone I knew was gone.
|-
!Wendy
|Hey, hey, it's okay. We have each other now. And [[Toby Determined]], who I accidentally mistook for a monster.
|-
!Toby
|This just in: this arrow in my shoulder.
|-
!Wendy
|We shouldn't stay out in the open for too long. Let me show you my hideout. ''(Leads them to the Edgy on Purpose store, cooks the bat)'' We were playing Truth or Dare in the cemetary when it happened. The eyeballs froze [[Nate]], [[Lee]], [[Tambry]] and [[Thompson]]. ''(Presses a button on the cash register she's sitting on and takes some money to wipe her face with)'' [[Robbie Valentino|Robbie]] almost got away but had to pause to take a selfie. What about you?
|-
!Dipper
|I was in a fight with Mabel when it happened. Uncle Ford asked me to be his apprentice once the summer was over. But that would mean I wouldn't go back home. It would mean growing up without Mabel.
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, ''dude''.
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel didn't take it well and she ran off into the forest. She couldn't even look me in the eye.
|-
!Wendy
|Come on. Let's get some fresh air. Toby, you watch the camp.
|-
!Toby
|''(Dressed in a bunch of the Edgy on Purpose clothes)'' Don't call me "Toby" anymore. Call me Bodacious T.
|-
!Wendy
|No one will ever call you that.
|-
!Toby
|Ooh...
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Wendy outside.''
|-
!Wendy
|The end of the world. Man, those death metal album covers got it shockingly right.
|-
!Dipper
|You know, I used to think I could get out of anything, but this? The journals are destroyed, Ford is captured and I can't find my family anywhere. Bill said it himself, there's no room for heroes out here. We lost.
|-
!Wendy
|Look, dude, it's not over yet. You've beaten Bill twice before, why is this time any different?
|-
!Dipper
|'Cause then I had Mabel.
|-
!Wendy
|Then you need to get Mabel back. Look, this summer, I've seen some amazing things, but nothing as amazing as you and your sister. I don't know if it's dumb luck or yin and yang, or whatever, but when you two work together, there's like nothing you two can't accomplish. You just need to make up, and team up, and save the universe.
|-
!Dipper
|But how will I ever find her?
|-
!
|''A monster eats a billboard, revealing a [[Prison Bubble|bubble]] with Mabel's shooting star on it at the cliffs.''
|-
!Dipper
|The shooting star from Mabel's sweater! She's in there. I know it.
|-
!Wendy
|Whoa, it that like twin ESP?
|-
!Dipper
|No, we don't have that, but we do have this thing where our allergies totally act up at the same time. ''(Sneezes)'' Mabel needs us. But how are we gonna get out there without being caught?
|-
!Wendy
|I have an idea.
|-
!
|''Cut to the fearamid, where the party is going on.''
|-
!Demons
|''(Spinning a stone Lazy Susan)'' Spin the person! Spin the person! ''(Lazy Susan's head points at Pyronica)''
|-
!Hectorgon
|Ah! ''(Flies away)''
|-
!Pyronica
|''(Catches him with her tongue and swallows him)''

|Hahahaha! Go nuts, guys! When we're done partying, I unveil Phase 2.
|-
![[Lolph and Dundgren|Lolph]]
|''(Offscreen, pounding on door)'' Open up! This is the police. [[Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron|Time Police.]]
|-
!
|''The demons all look at Bill.''
|-
!Bill
|Just play it cool, ditch the time-punch. Let me do the talking.
|-
!Lolph
|Bill Cipher. You are in violation of the rules of space-time, and possessing the body of a time officer.
|-

|My body is a temple! How dare you!!
|-
![[Time Baby]]
|Hear this, Cipher!
|-
!Bill
|Ugh, Time Baby.
|-
!Time Baby
|''(Projects a hologram of the universe)'' If your rip in this dimension continues, it could destroy the very fabric of existence! ''(The universe in the hologram explodes)'' Surrender now, or face my tantrum!
|-
!Bill
|Oh, no, a tantrum! Whatever will a do about that HOW 'BOUT THIS?? BOOM. ''(Vaporizes the Time Baby and the police; eye turns into a mouth and blows the smoke off his finger)''
|-
!Kryptos
|Ah, snap! He just killed Time Baby!
|-
!Demons
|Yeahhh! ''(Resume partying)''
|-
!Blendin
|''(Hiding behind a pole)'' Aw, man, this has gone from bad to worse! I gotta get out of time-Dodge! ''(Disappears)''
|-
!8 Ball
|''(Approaches with Teeth)'' Boss, the Pine Tree kid got away before we could eat him. Are you worried he might try to cause some trouble?
|-
!Teeth
|Yeah, trouble with Mabel's bubble?
|-
!Bill
|Ha! I'm not worried. I've got ''someone on the case.''
|-
!
|''Cut to the Bud Gleeful's auto-mart. Dipper, Toby and Wendy are looking over the fence.''
|-
!Wendy
|The abandoned auto-mart. Free cars right for the hot-wiring. We just found our ride to Mabel. I wonder if they have a tank. I've ''always'' wanted to drive a tank!
|-
!Dipper
|I can't believe this place is just abandoned.
|-
!Toby
|''(Looking into a car)'' Ooh, an air freshener. Finally I'll smell like a person. Stealy stealy...
|-
!
|''A tranquilizer dart hits him.''
|-
!Toby
|Ah! It's gonna take more than one dart to keep me from-
|-
!
|''Several more darts hit him and he collapses.''
|-
!Wendy
|Oh no! Tony! Was it Tony? I can never remember his name.
|-
!
|''Three car headlights turn on in front of them. Three giant cars, each with prisoners inside, surround them.''
|-
!Prisoner
|Well, well, looks like we got ourselves a pair of ground walkers.
|-
!Prisoner 2
|Heheh! Ground walkers! Heheh! Ain't got no wheels!
|-
!Prisoners
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Wendy
|Listen [[Discount Auto Mart Warriors|Discount Auto Warriors]]!
|-
!Dipper
|We just wanna make it to that bubble out east; we have no quarrel with you!
|-
!Gideon
|''(With a voice-lowering megaphone:)'' Oh, but that's where you're wrong! Hands where I can see 'em.
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|''(Hold up hands)''
|-
!Gideon
|Y'all fellers ain't goin' nowhere.
|-
!Wendy
|"Y'all?"
|-
!Dipper
|"Fellers?" Wait... Gideon!?
|-
!Gideon
|That's Sheriff Gideon! ''(Without megaphone:)'' Under the authority of Bill Cipher, I place you two under arrest! Oh, hi, Wendy! Have we formally met?
|-
!
|''Prisoners lead Dipper and Wendy to Gideon, who is standing on the back of a truck.''
|-
!Gideon
|Wooooo-we! Look what the apocalypse dragged in! Y'all are in a twelve-piece bucket of deep fried trouble now! Ghost-Eyes! Spitoon!''(Spits gum out into spitoon)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ugh, it's Gideon.
|-
!Wendy
|And he's gotten folksier.
|-
!Gideon
|Ma' old pal Bill figured you might try to rescue Mabel. So he appointed me, master of these wastelands, and ''keeper of the bubble!'' My sweet precious Mabel's trapped inside and I HAVE THE ONLY KEY! ''(Shows them a key with the shooting star symbol on it)'' Wrapped around my... well I wouldn't call it a neck exactly, wrapped around this little pocket of fat under ma' head?
|-
!Dipper
|Gideon, you have ''no right'' to keep her in there!
|-
!Gideon
|Bill explained it to me nice and simple: she was always destined to be mine! ''(Takes a newspaper article from when he was dating her from his hat)'' And now that I have her in a cage she'll learn to love me! I have an eternity to wait! Ghost-Eyes! Ready to escort our friends to Bill's dungeon?
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|''(Picks Dipper and Wendy up)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh! No! Hey!
|-
!Wendy
|This isn't gonna work, Gideon.
|-
!Gideon
|Oh? And why's that?
|-
!Wendy
|Cause after I break Ghost-Eyes' arm and steal that key from your neck, I'm gonna wear your butt on my foot like a rhinestone slipper!
|-
!Prisoners behind Gideon
|''(Laugh)''
|-
!Gideon
|Oho, and what makes you think you can do all that?
|-
!Wendy
|'Cause I'm a flippin' CORDUROY! ''(Flips over Ghost-Eyes' arm and pulls him back)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Falls on the ground and ducks, tripping Ghost-Eyes)''
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|''(Run away)''
|-
!Gideon
|Ghost-Eyes! My hench-angel!
|-
!Wendy
|Ha! ''(Grabs Gideon and rips the key from his neck, to prisoners:)'' Get back! Get back! Or I will drop-kick him, I swear! ''(Breaks a car window and unlocks it)''
|-
!Gideon
|You'll never get away with this, ya hear me?!
|-
!Wendy
|Guess what? We already DID! ''(Kicks Gideon into the other prisoners)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Getting into the car behind her)'' Wendy, you're the coolest person I know.
|-
!Wendy
|I know, dude. Tell me about it later. ''(Drives away)''
|-
!Gideon
|After them!
|-
!Prisoners
|''(Get into cars)''
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|''(Carrying Gideon into a car)'' You want your baby seat?
|-
!Gideon
|Yes, please.
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|''(Buckles him into a carseat)''
|-
!Gideon
|''(Over a microphone:)'' We are not letting 'em get Mabel! Discount Auto-mart Warriors, rollout!
|-
!Prisoners
|''(Drive away, cheering)''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, all we have to do is outrace Gideon's henchmen, unlock the bubble, save Mabel, save the world. ''(Sees that Wendy had hit a mailbox)'' Quick question: did you ever get your driver's license?
|-
!Wendy
|Definitely not. Arm! ''(Swerves to avoid The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity)''
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|Ah!
|-
!The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity
|''(Grabs one of the cars)''
|-
!Prisoner inside car
|Uhahhhhh! ''(screams this as windshield cracks)''
|-
!The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity
|''(Eats the car)''
|-
!Gideon
|Swerve swerve! ''(Ghost-Eyes Swerves to avoid the arm)'' I can't let 'em free Mabel!
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|Remind me why you're keeping your girlfriend in a prison bubble again? Have we, the prisoners, become the wardens?
|-
!Gideon
|SHE LOVES ME! She just doesn't know it yet. Now quit the philosophy.
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|Sorry. It ''was'' my major.
|-
!
|''The cars drive toward some bubbles.''
|-
!Gideon
|Ha! Weirdness bubbles blockin' the path! WOOOOWEE we got 'em now.
|-
!Dipper
|Watch it! Go around that bubble field!
|-
!Wendy
|No way around! Hold on! We're goin' through!
|-
!Dipper
|What's even in there?!
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|''(Scream as they enter a bubble, then they have bird heads)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Chirping, subtitled:)'' For some reason, I really want worms right now.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Chirping, subtitled:)'' Eat worms! Fly south! Nest!
|-
!
|''The car exits the bubble and Dipper and Wendy are normal again.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Coughing up feathers)'' Oh, that was horrible!
|-
!Wendy
|Here comes another one, dude! Brace yourself! ''(Drives through three more bubbles)''
|-
!Dipper and Wendy
|''(Screaming, they become anime characters, then they are made of meat products, then they become live-action)''
|-
!Gideon and Ghost-Eyes
|''(Screaming, they become made of 3D blocks, female versions of themselves in dresses and make-up, and old-fashioned silent cartoon versions of themselves, a card comes up that says:)'' "AAAAAAAAAUGH!"
|-
!
|''Both the cars are back to normal. Ghost-Eyes slams his truck against Wendy's car, breaking the glass.''
|-
!Wendy
|Ah!
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy, we're almost there! We just have to make that jump!
|-
!Wendy
|Total lack of driver's training, don't fail me now. ''(Accelerates and drives off the cliff, screaming as the car flies through the air)''
|-
!
|''The car hits the ground and rolls. When it stops, the passenger door opens and Dipper falls out.''
|-
!Dipper
|So... close. ''(Crawling)'' Mabel... I'm... almost there. ''(Stops in front of a figure in a cloak)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Offers him his hand and pulls back his hood)'' Heya, Dipper. How's it hanging?
|-
!Dipper
|Soos!
|-
!Wendy
|''(Stands up from behind the car, bruised)'' Soos?
|-
!Soos
|Handyman of the apocalypse, at your service.
|-
!Dipper
|Soos! How'd you, where'd you-?
|-
!Soos
|I've been wandering the plains like a desperado, helping strangers. I guess there's some folk songs about me now? ''(Looking at Wendy's arm)'' Let me see what the damage is, here. Ah, well the good news is: your arm is okay.
|-
!Dipper
|So what's the bad news?
|-
!Soos
|Bad news is we're surrounded, dudes.
|-
!
|''The prisoners have surrounded them, cheering.''
|-
!Gideon
|Wooowee. I dare say y'all almost had the jump on me there for a second. But this ain't your [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] anymore! Out here, I win. ''(Claps and gets thrown a conch, which he blows)'' Bill's henchbats will be here any minute to retrieve y'all. MABEL'S MINE NOW! Hahahaha!
|-
!Dipper
|Is she?
|-
!Gideon
|Well, yeah. I have her trapped, ergo, Mabel is MINE!
|-
!Dipper
|Gideon, listen to me, if I've learned anything this summer it's that you can't force someone to love you. ''(Looking at Wendy)'' The best you can do is strive to be someone worthy of loving.
|-
!Gideon
|Oh, I'm worthy o' lovin'! These prisoners love me!
|-
!Prisoners except Gideon
|''(Cheer)''
|-
!Dipper
|But Mabel doesn't. Because you're selfish. But you can change! Bill thinks there's no heroes in this world, but if we work together and fight back, we ''can'' defeat him. You wanna be Mabel's hero? Stand up to Bill, and let us save her!
|-
!Gideon
|That's crazy! You know what Bill would do to me if that happens?
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|What, you scared of Bill?
|-
!Gideon
|No, I ju... it's a complicated situation.
|-
!Dipper
|Look inside, Gideon. If all this is for Mabel, then ask yourself what Mabel would want you to do.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Looks at the newspaper article, looks at the picture of him and Mabel together, with him smiling and Mabel looking unconformable, quietly:)'' Dipper. Will you tell her what I did?
|-
!Dipper
|Of course.
|-
!Gideon
|I hope you're right about this. ''(To the prisoners:)'' Guys, new plan! Bill's minions are gonna be on us in seconds. But I'm not gonna let that dumb triangle be the warden o' me! Y'all ready for a good old fashioned prison brawl?
|-
!Ghost-Eyes
|We're behind you for life, brother!
|-
!Prisoner
|Fighting children is boring, but fighting a chaos god sounds fun!
|-
!Gideon
|Lets do this! ''(As the prisoners drive toward the fearamid)'' Henchmen, rollout!
|-
!Prisoners
|''(Cheer)''

|''Cut to Dipper, Soos and Wendy in front of Mabel's bubble.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, remember, guys. This is a prison bubble designed ''by'' Bill. We've got to prepare ourselves for what we find in here.
|-
!Soos
|Whatever it is, we'll do it together. For Mabel! ''(Puts his hand in the center)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Puts her hand on top of his)'' For Mabel!

![[Sprott]]
|End times are here, folks. Only way to salvation is to embrace the triangular ways of our overlord. Any object with more than three sides is sinful. ''([[Manly Dan]] holds up a triangular section of a stop sign that he cut)'' That's it. That's probably what [[Bill Cipher|Bill]] wants.
|-
!
|''An [[Eye-Bats|Eye-Bat]] comes and Manly Dan screams as he is turned to stone.''

|I reckon I've been livin' a lie. ''(Screams as he is turned to stone and then carried away by the Eye-Bat)''

|-
!Bill
|Ladies, gentlemen, that creature with like 87 different faces.
|-
![[Creature with 88 different faces]]
|88 different faces!
|-
!Bill
|Whoa-ho, sorry - touchy subject. Anyways, it's been fun turning [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] inside out, rounding up all its terrified citizens and then stacking them into this massive [[Bill's Throne|throne]] of frozen human agony. (''The last word echoes; sits on the throne)'' Don't worry, they're not conscious anymore. Probably.
|-
![[Lazy Susan]]
|''(Unfreezes)'' Uh, my omelettes. They-they have friendly faces.
|-
!Bill
|Whoops. Hehe, back, back you go there. ''(Pokes Lazy Susan back into place until she turns back into stone)'' But Gravity Falls is just the beginning. It's time to take our chaos worldwide! Alright boys, to the corners of the Earth. Set the world aflame with your weirdness. This dimension is ours! ''(Bill's friends come out of the Fearamid)'' Ah, global domination. I could get used to - ''(the demons hit an invisible shield and fall down)'' WHAT??!!! ''(Goes to the shield and pokes it; the shot pans out to show that the whole town is surrounded by an invisible force shield, containing the rift and Bill's chaos)'' Hmm, this might be more complicated than I thought.

|''Cut to the shortened [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]] [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]]. Scene opens on the [[Prison Bubble]] and zooms in, showing [[Dipper Pines]], [[Soos Ramirez]] and [[Wendy Corduroy]] inside the bubble.''
|-
!Dipper
|[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]! Mabel! Okay guys, Bill has taken over the town and if his weirdness spreads he's gonna take over the whole world. Our first step to stopping him is rescuing Mabel, but he's got her trapped in this strange prison bubble.
|-
!Wendy
|What ''is'' this place anyway?
|-
!
|''The ground starts cracking with rainbow-colored fractures; Soos, Dipper and Wendy scream as they fall.''
|-
!Soos
|Guys, if I die, I wanna die hugging. ''(Grabs Dipper and Wendy in a hug)''
|-
!Dipper
|Soos, you're choking me.
|-
!Soos
|Let my body be your shield!
|-
!
|''Continued screaming until the three land on a bouncy-house.''
|-
!Dipper
|Huh? Is the entire ground a bouncy castle?
|-
!Wendy
|Do you hear 80's music?
|-
!Soos
|And does the air smell like childlike wonder?
|-
!Dipper, Wendy and Soos
|''(Look out at Mabeland)'' Whoa.
|-
!Dipper
|This is Mabel's prison?
|-
![[Unnamed boy in green]]
|''(Holding up Mabel's letter with every box checked, excitedly:)'' Yes. Definitely. Absolutely.
|-
!Announcer
|It's fun-o'clock everyone. Today's weather calls for rainbows with a chance of dance parties. If you are the owner of a unicorn with a top hat, please come to the ice cream beach. Your unicorn is being towed.
|-
!Soos
|What is this new world? Shining, shimmering, splendid.
|-
!
|''A pineapple runs screaming as [[Xyler and Craz]] drive up and almost run it over.''
|-
!Craz
|Welcome to Mabeland.
|-
!Dipper
|And this is worse than the apocalypse.
|-
!Wendy
|Dude, this place hurts my eyes.
|-
!Xyler
|Oh that's normal. Mabeland's rainbows have colors only bees and art students can see. Now who wants to go on the grand tour?
|-
!Dipper
|Do we have a choice?
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|No!
|-
!
|''They begin driving with Dipper, Soos and Wendy in the car.''
|-
!Xyler
|Mabeland is the ultimate paradise and the only rule: there are no rules.
|-
!Craz
|Except for one rule which is very serious. But no one would ever break it, so it's not worth mentioning.
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|Yeah!
|-
!Dipper
|Listen creepy dream guys, we're not here to party, okay? We just need to find Mabel and get her out of here. Where is she?
|-
!Craz
|Our home girl Mabel lives at our next stop. ''(The car crashes through a building, hits a fire hydrant, and skids through the street)''
|-
!Xyler
|No rules!
|-
!
|''They arrive at a beach.''
|-
!Xyler
|Now, come have rad snacks served by awesome penguins.
|-
!
|''Penguins walk up with trays full of food and drinks.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Takes a drink)'' Oh, score! I'm so hungry.
|-
!Soos
|''(Takes a drink)'' Yeah, I haven't eaten anything except for part of my hat for the last three days.
|-
!Soos and Wendy
|''(Clink cups)''
|-
!Wendy
|Hah!
|-
!Dipper
|Can you guys just hold on a second? Do you see what's happening here? Don't forget this world was created by ''Bill''. ''(Slaps Soos' drink away as he is about to drink from it)'' That punch is probably blood! And that glitter rain ''(A cloud of glitter appears over him)'' is probably ground up bones, or babies, or something. ''(Collects some glitter in his hand and drops it)'' Bill's using Mabel's own fantasies as some sick trap. We need to grab Mabel and get the heck out of here.
|-
!Craz
|Oh, Mabel? She's at the top of the tallest tower guarded by those big buff waffle guards. There's no way to get past them!
|-
!Soos
|Someone hand me some syrup. ''(Jumps on a guard from behind and starts to eat him)''
|-
!Guard
|Aaah! It's happening! The moment we've trained for!
|-
!Guard 2
|Oh, don't worry, man! I've got ya- ''(Screams as face is punched out by Wendy)''
|-
!Wendy
|It's now or never, guys!
|-
!
|''Cut to the inside of the tower, where several animals are frolicking.''
|-
!Dipper, Soos and Wendy
|''(Punch open the doors)''
|-
!Dipper
|This is a rescue! Everyone hit the deck!
|-
!Soos
|''(Picks up one of the animals and throws it, then follows Dipper and Wendy up the stairs)'' Hang in there, Mabel!
|-
!Dipper, Soos and Wendy
|''(Burst through the doors to the bedroom)''
|-
!Dipper
|There she is! Soos! Grab her! Wendy, barricade the door! ''(Wendy does so)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Picks up Mabel, who is sleeping)'' Up you go, little lady.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Wakes up)'' Soos? Wendy? Dipper?
|-
!Wendy
|''(As swords are being poked through the door)'' The waffles are coming back! We gotta hurry!
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, guys?
|-
!Dipper
|Don't worry, Mabel, we'll get you out of this!
|-
!Mabel
|But, Dipper! ''(Claps twice and lifts everything in front of the door off the ground. She puts everything down in order and seats Dipper, Soos and Wendy on some chairs - the guards come in and point their spears at them; she claps and they stop)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel! What are you doing? We're trying to save you from this prison!
|-
!Mabel
|This isn't a prison! I made this world! ''(Claps and the lights come on)'' Well, I sort of woke up here. It's complicated.
|-
!Dipper
|What are you saying?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Reveals a plaque that says "MAYOR MABEL")'' I'm saying this is my home now. And I don't want to be saved!
|-
!Bubble Bear
|''(Flies into the window and bumps the windowpane)'' Sorry, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|No worries, Bubble Bear.
|-
!
|''Commercial break.''
|-
!Dipper
|You did ''what''?
|-
!Mabel
|Look, after you said you wouldn't come back home with me at the end of the summer for your "apprenticeship," I wanted to hide in my sweater forever. But then I woke up in a place that gives me exactly what I wanted: an endless summer where I never have to grow up! Here the sun shines all day, the party never ends, and now that you guys are here, it's finally perfect!
|-
!Dipper
|Listen, Mabel, we're not here to party. All of this is crazy!
|-
!Mabel
|Ugghh. I figured ''you'' might say something like that, Dipper. That's why I prepared a backup Dipper with a more supportive attitude.
|-
![[Dippy Fresh]]
|''(Rides in on a skateboard)'' Wohoho! ''(High fives Mabel)'' Yeah! Wiggity-wiggity-what's up, dude-bros? I'm Dippy Fresh! I like skateboarding, supporting my sister, and punctuating every sentence with a high five! Hup! ''(Holds up hand)''
|-
!Soos
|Oh! Don't mind if I-
|-
!Dipper
|''(Clears throat)''
|-
!Soos
|I'm sorry, I can't leave him hanging! Yus! ''(High fives Dippy Fresh)''
|-
!Dipper
|You're dead to me, Soos.
|-
!Mabel
|Trust me, you guys are gonna love it here. This world always knows what you want. Sometimes even before you do! ''(A chinchilla drops into her arms)'' Apparently I wanted a chinchilla! Right again, Mabeland!
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel, listen to yourself. This is crazy! I'm sorry about our fight, and I'm sorry things aren't great right now but that doesn't mean you can just stay in here forever!
|-
!Dippy Fresh
|Hey, take a chill pill! Those grow on trees here!
|-
!Dipper
|YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, DIPPY FRESH!
|-
!Soos
|Dude, calm down; Dippy Fresh didn't do anything to you, dawg.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Growls at Dippy Fresh)''
|-
!Mabel
|I know it sounds too good to be true, but just give this place a chance! Mabeland knows just what you want and always provides! ''(Claps and Dipper, Soos and Wendy's clothes go back to normal. A flying hamburger goes up to Soos)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Bites it)'' Pudding center. Nice!
|-
!Wendy
|Uh, actually, Mabel, I'm with Dipper on this. Gravity Falls is in trouble and I really think-

|-
!Thompson, [[Tambry]], [[Lee]] and [[Nate]]
|Wendy!
|-
!Wendy
|Wha- guys? You're safe!
|-
!Lee
|We've got a monster truck full of fireworks, fake IDs, and pranking supplies.
|-
!Nate
|Wanna drive this truck to the high school and glue this plunger to the principal's head?
|-
!Wendy
|''(Eyes sparkling) ''Yes. Yes I do. Sorry, guys, I've always wanted to do that. I'll be back in just a few minutes. ''(Gets in truck)''
|-
!Teens
|''(Drive away, cheering)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy!?
|-
!Soos
|Don't worry, dude. There's nothing in this world that could break me from our mission.

![[Ernesto]]
|Soos, mijo. I have returned.
|-
!Soos
|Holy- whoa, whoa. Dad?
|-
!Ernesto
|You don't remember what I look like, so I have the body of a pro wrestler and a face you once saw on a hot sauce bottle. I was never there for you, but in this world, I can be.
|-
!Soos
|You're perfect!
|-
!Dipper
|It's a trap! Don't go with him, Soos! No matter what he offers you!
|-
!Ernesto
|''(Holds up ball and baseball glove)'' Want to play catch?
|-
!Soos
|I'm sorry, dude. Even if it is all a dream, I've gotta play just one game. Hahaha! Come on, Dad! ''(Chases the ball his "dad" throws)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' Okay, this has gone too far! You can't honestly think these fantasies are good for anyone!
|-
!Mabel
|You can't argue with the results: people are happy here! Does it really matter if it's real or not? For once, stop listening to your head and listen to your heart. Mabeland has something for everyone! Even you! In fact: ''(A door begins to open)''
|-
!Dipper
|Nope. Not looking. ''Not looking. (Leaves)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Fearamid]]. The demons groan.''
|-
!Bill
|Alright, can anyone explain to me why, even with our newfound INFINITE POWER, ''(Lightning strikes the columns)'' none of us can escape the borders of this STUPID HICK TOWN!!!! ''(Sits in throne)'' There's some kind of force field keeping us in, but who would know how to fix it? ''(Holds Ford)'' Hmm. Maybe ''someone'' needs to come out of retirement. ''(Eye flashes Journal pages)''
|-
![[Keyhole]]
|Bill! ''(Bill's eye back to normal)'' Uh, sorry, Boss, but [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]] let the Pines family escape! They're inside Mabel's bubble as we speak!
|-
!Bill
|''(Laughs)'' Buddy, Mabel's bubble is the most diabolical trap I've ever created. It would take a will of titanium not to give into its temptation. Fetch me Gideon and take the rest of the day off. Things just got a little more interesting.

!Stuffed animals

|-
!Dipper
|''(Angrily throws a stone across the river; it skips while a child's giggling is heard)'' Ugh, even my stone skips are perfect! ''(Sighs)'' Who am I kidding? Maybe Mabel's right. It's a horror show out there. At least the air in here is breathable.
|-
!Fake Wendy
|Dude, you're talking to a river.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, hey, Wendy, what's up? I thought you were busy wrecking the school or whatever.
|-
!Fake Wendy
|Yeah, that got old quick. And this music is really starting to get on my nerves. I think that stuff you said about this place is right.
|-
!Dipper
|Really? Well, now we just need a plan.
|-
!Fake Wendy
|Don't worry, you always think of something. ''(Throws stone, and it skips while giggles are heard, the stone explodes in the sky and a screen pops up that says "100 POINTS")'' You know, you're so much smarter than like everyone else. Heh. It's kinda funny. If you were older you'd be like, my dream guy.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, do you really mean that?
|-
!Fake Wendy
|Wait a minute. In this place you can be any age you want! If we were the same age ''(Pulls a flower farther out of the ground so that it is as tall as the flower next to it)'' maybe you and me could, I don't know, actually be together.
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, really?!
|-
!Fake Wendy
|I bet, if we ask Mabel, she could do it right now! In this place it could finally be just you and me. Come on, man! Just take my hand. ''(Holds out hand and winks)''
|-
!Dipper
|Wait, aaahhh,... this isn't real!
|-
!
|''The fake Wendy turns into a bunch of centipedes and the sky darkens.''

|You shouldn't have done that, Dippeerrrr! We're watching you.

|-
!Mabel
|No! Of course not; that's my brother, guys! There's gotta be another way.
|-
!Guard
|Very well. If Dipper wishes to stay, he must plead his case in the ultimate trial. Of fantasy vs. reality.

!Soos
|''(Pointing to a stuffed rhino)'' It was him.

|Sorry, sorry. ''(Clears throat)'' We are here to try Dipper Pines in the case of fantasy vs. reality. ''(The words "FANTASY," written in fancy handwriting, and "REALITY," written like a stamp, appear next to him)'' If Dipper wins, Mabel will return with him to the real world! But if he loses he will be banished forever! And replaced with town darling, Dippy Fresh! ''(Points at Dippy Fresh, who is standing next to the catscratcher)'' Dippy, come on out.

|-
!Mabel 3
|What, come on!
|-
!Mabel 7
|GUILTY!
|-
!Dipper
|But I know one thing well, and that's you. And I know that although you might act like it, you don't wanna be in this fantasy world.
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, pffsh, yeah right.
|-
!Dipper
|You're scared. Of growing up. And who could blame you; I'm scared, too.
|-
!Mabel
|Uh, ''(covers ears)'' LALALALALALA I'M NOT LISTENING! GUARDS! ''(Claps)'' The FINGERS! ''(The guards stick foam fingers in her ears)''
|-
!Dipper
|Look, real life stinks sometimes, okay, I'm not gonna lie. But there's a better way to get through it than denial, and that's with help from people who care about you. It's how we've gotten through our whole lives. Just look. ''(Scene changes to the photo day after Mabel got gum in her hair; in flashback:)'' Mabel! I figured out a way to fix your photo!
|-
!Mabel
|''(In flashback:)'' What? You have a wig?
|-
!Dipper
|No! But, I have a razor! ''(Shaves a line down his head)''
|-
!Mabel
|Haha! You're crazy! ''(Takes the razor and shaves the part of her hair with gum in it)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Laugh and pose for picture)'' Haaa!
|-
!Mabel
|''(In present, takes the foam fingers away from her ears)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Scene changes to Dipper in the closet after he got no Valentines)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(In flashback, slides a bunch of valentines taped into a heart that says "For My Favorite Brother" under the door)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Scene changes back to courtroom, in present:)'' We've always been there for each other. ''(Flashes the scrapbook to Dipper giving Mabel a Band-Aid in [[Summerween]], then to them fist-bumping in [[Sock Opera]], then to Mabel lowering them down from the cliff with her [[Mabel's grappling hook|grappling hook]] in [[Gideon Rises]])'' Mabel, I thought ''you'' were living a fantasy, but look at me! I actually thought I was gonna stay here and be Ford's apprentice! Spend my entire teens cooped up in a basement with a labcoat? How ridiculous is that? I don't know what's gonna happen in the future, but whatever it is, you don't have to fear because we'll do it together. I'm not taking Ford's apprenticeship. We've traveled to Heck and back to get you and we're goin' back together. Leave this fantasy world. Let's beat Bill and grow up together.

!
|''Crowd mutters.''
|-
!Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein
|ORDER! ORDER! ''(Bangs mallet)'' ORDER IN THE COURT! DANG IT why is this hammer squeaky?!
|-
!Mabel
|You mean it? You're really coming home with me?
|-
!Dipper
|Yes. Definitely. Absolutely. Awkward sibling hug?
|-
!
|''Crowd shrieks.''
|-
!Blue Bird
|Just don't do it!
|-
!Craz
|DON'T DO IT!
|-
!Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein
|You do this and it's all over!
|-
!Mabel
|Sincere sibling hug. ''(Hugs Dipper)''
|-
!Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein
|DON'T DO THE PATS!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Pat each other)'' Pat pat. ''(A ripple comes from their spot, blowing Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein's wig away and one of the benches falls over. All of the jurors disappear)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Rubs eyes)'' Aw, man, I never noticed how bright this place is, ugh! Have I actually been listening to the same song for an entire week?
|-
!Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein
|''(Meows in a distressed manner)''
|-
!Mabel
|Whoa, time to calm you down. ''(Claps twice)'' Uh, why isn't this working? ''(Claps)''
|-
!Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein
|Because your reign over this land is OVER! ''(Splits open and becomes a nightmare-ish pile of yarn)''
|-
!
|''The crowd turns gray and their eyes glow red.''
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|''(Hug each other and yell)''
|-
!Mabel
|We gotta get out of here!
|-
!Dipper
|Soos! Wendy! Paradise is canceled!
|-
!
|''The humans run away as the whole world turns gray.''
|-
!Mabel
|Everyone get on!
|-
!
|''They get on [[Waddles]], who is the size of an elephant.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Slaps him and he wakes up)'' Take us to freedom, Giant Waddles! Yah!
|-
!Waddles
|''(Runs away)''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, guys, are you ready for this? ''(Grabs a giant knitting needle)'' Sorry, Mabeland. It's time to burst your BUBBLE! ''(As Waddles jumps, she breaks the bubble with the needle; the bubble explodes into confetti; she is lying on the ground of the cliff)'' Ugh. You all good, everyone good?
|-
!
|''Waddles shrinks back to his normal size. Everyone is wearing the clothing they were wearing before.''
|-
!Dipper, Soos and Wendy
|''(Hug her)''
|-
!Soos
|We've missed you, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Hey, Dipper? I appreciate what you said back there, but if you want to take Ford's apprenticeship, I won't get in your way.
|-
!Dipper
|Psh. And miss out on your awkward teen years? You wish. ''(Laughs)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs)'' Man, I went nuts back there. I mean come on. The real world can't be that bad, right? ''(Looks the other way and sees [[Gompers]] is still giant and the Fearamid)'' Oh boy.
|-
!
|''Cut to everyone at ground level.''
|-
!Mabel
|Where is everyone?
|-
!Wendy
|The town's deserted.
|-
!Soos
|Did Bill already win?
|-
!Dipper
|Come on, guys. Let's see if we can still go hide out in the Shack.
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
!Dipper
|Yes! It's in shambles! Just like we left it.
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, man, this is the first time I've ever felt happy going to work.
|-
!Mabel
|''(As they are running to it)'' Hello, house. Hello, porch. Hello, wads of gum I left stuck to the couch.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reaches for the handle, then stops when he hear scuffling)'' Wait, what was that? Shh. ''(Picks up a golf club)''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Aims crossbow)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Pounds fist)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holds up grappling hook)''
|-
!Soos
|Let's get 'em, dudes.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Kicks open the door)''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Wendy
|''(Run in)'' Yaaahh!!
|-
![[Celestabellebethabelle]], [[Chutzpar]], [[Bats Biker]], [[Woodpecker guy]], [[Candy]], [[Stan Pines]], [[Grenda]], [[Sheriff Blubs]], [[Pacifica Northwest]], [[Old Man McGucket]] and some [[Gnomes]]
|Yaaaahhhh!!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Stan?
|-
!Stan
|Kids?
|-
![[Multi-Bear]]
|''(Flushes toilet and comes out with a cardboard roll)'' Just so everyone knows, we're out of toilet paper. Did I miss something?
|-
!
|''Cut to end credits. Xyler and Craz emerge from a pile of confetti.''
|-
!Xyler
|Woah! We survived!
|-
!Craz
|Where are we?
|-
!Xyler and Craz
|''(Sit on a bench)''
|-
!Xyler
|Are we real? Is this reality? Jean-Paul Sartre postulated that every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.
|-
!Craz
|Totally righteous, bro.
|-
!Xyler

|-
![[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], [[Mabel Pines]], [[Soos Ramirez]] and [[Wendy Corduroy]]
|''(Run into the [[Mystery Shack]])'' Yaaahh!!
|-
![[Celestabellebethabelle]], [[Chutzpar]], [[Bats Biker]], [[Woodpecker guy]], [[Candy]], [[Stan Pines]], [[Grenda]], [[Sheriff Blubs]], [[Pacifica Northwest]], [[Old Man McGucket]] and some [[Gnomes]]
|Yaaaahhhh!!
|-
!Dipper
|Wait.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Grunkle Stan! ''(Run to him)''
|-
!Stan
|Kids! I can't believe it! I thought I lost you two!
|-
!Soos
|''(Hugs Stan)'' Mr. Pines! It's really you! I've been hugging strangers to practice for this moment.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Slams into Stan for a hug)'' We missed you, you old codger!
|-
!Stan
|''(Chuckles)'' I've missed you knuckleheads, too. It's good to have you back.
|-
!Dipper
|So...what's everyone doing here? ''(Gasps as some [[Lilliputtians]] run past him)''
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah there's like monsters and gnomes, and is Pacifica wearing a potato sack?
|-
!Pacifica
|Hey! Even in a sack I still look better than you.
|-
![[Multi-Bear]]
|It's...it's a long story.
|-
![[Wax figures|Wax Larry King]]
|''(In the vents)'' Hey, is anyone gonna feed me? Larry King's disembodied wax head wants num-nums.
|-
!Grenda
|We're trying to ration our food, remember? ''(As Wax Larry King chews on her hair)'' Uhhh...it's happening again.
|-
!Multi-bear
|''(Pushes the knob, closing the vents)''
|-
![[Manotaurs|Pituitaur]]
|''(Looking out the door)'' Hey, everyone! [[Eye-Bats|Eye-bat]]!
|-
!
|''Everyone gasps.''
|-
!Gnome
|Evasive maneuvers!
|-
!Stan
|''(Slams the door and grabs Dipper and Mabel)'' Shhh, keep it down.
|-
!
|''The refugees scatter.''
|-
!Gnome
|Hit the lights!
|-
!
|''Outside, an eye-bat turns a scampering raccoon into stone and flies off with it. Cut to [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme|theme song]].''
|-
!Stan
|''(Lights a match and throws it into a can, illuminating the shack, revealing the people sitting around the room)'' Welcome to what's left of normal around here. Home base.
|-
!
|''The screen pans across the various people hiding in the Mystery Shack.''
|-
![[Toby Determined]]
|''(As a gnome pulls a dart out of him)'' Ow!
|-
!Greggy C.
|We have...
|-
![[Sev'ral Timez]]
|''(Singing:)'' Several injuries! ''(Clutch their injuries)'' Oh, ow...
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Ow, my liver, girl!
|-
!Dipper
|Ah! [[Rumble McSkirmish]]?
|-
!Rumble
|Do not be afraid. [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]] has taught me, there are some battles I cannot win. I am now Humble McSkirmish. ''(A digital "-50 despair" pops up next to Rumble)''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, how'd this all happen?
|-
!Stan
|So I was hammering signs out back when the sky started vomiting nightmares. I listen to a lot of AM radio so I knew what this meant: the end of the world. ''(Flashback of Stan running inside as the weirdness wave descends)'' What I didn't expect was what happened next. ''(The totem pole comes to life and attempts to attack the house, but hits a dome around it)'' Turns out whatever you and my brother did to the shack with your [[Unicorns|unicorn]] voodoo made the crazy place invincible to weirdness. ''(The totem pole falls over; cut back to the present.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Of course, the unicorn spell. That's why this is the only place [[Bill Cipher|Bill's]] magic can't touch.
|-
!Stan
|''(Gesturing to [[Old Man McGucket]])'' That's when Possum Breath over here shows up leading a bunch of injured stragglers through the forest. They needed a place to stay and since the [[Tyler Cutebiker|mayor]] got captured, I elected myself de facto chief. The plan's to stay in here and eat [[The Brown Meat|Brown Meat]] until we run out, then I vote we eat the gnomes.
|-
!Jeff
|Hey! I'm short, not deaf!
|-
!Stan
|Shh! Shh! Stress will make you chewy.
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, we can't all just hide inside the Shack. There's a [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|town]] in need of saving. Me and [[Ford Pines|Ford]] tried to do it, but he got captured by Bill.
|-
!Stan
|''(Opens can of The Brown Meat)'' Serves that jerk right. My brother's had some stupid plans, but going up against an all-powerful space demon was his worst one yet. Trust me, we have everything we need right here. ''(Sits down on a wooden lounge chair surrounded by the Multi-Bear and gnomes)'' It's not the Ritz but at least the monsters inside know how to massage. ''(To the Multi-Bear:)'' You know Shiatzu?
|-
!Multi-Bear
|Yes, I've taken some classes.
|-
!Dipper
|So you're really just gonna let Bill win?
|-
!Stan
|Look, kiddo. We got a good deal here. Besides, I'm sure wherever the rest of the townsfolk are, they're fine. ''(Slams his hand down, accidentally hitting the remote and turning on the TV)''
|-
![[Shandra Jimenez]]
|''(On the TV:)'' This is Shandra Jimenez reporting live from the inside of Bill's [[Fearamid|castle]]. Here for the first time are images of what's happened to the captured townsfolk. Viewers are advised to look away if they don't want to see their friends turned into a twisted throne of human agony.
|-
!Pacifica
|[[Priscilla Northwest|Mom]] and [[Preston Northwest|Dad]]?
|-
!Wendy
|[[Manly Dan|My]] [[Corduroy brothers|family]]!
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|[[Deputy Durland]]!
|-
!Shandra
|Is there no one who will save the people of this town? I'm Shandra Jimenez and I'm being turned into stone by a flying eyeball. ''(The TV turns to static)''
|-
!
|''Everyone gasps.''
|-
!Pacifica
|Oh, no. My parents are bad but even ''they'' don't deserve to be turned to stone.
|-
!Sheriff Blubs
|''(Drops down on his knees)'' Curse you, Bill! Why must you take everything we love? ''(Rips his shirt open and cries)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Climbing on top of the Multi-Bear)'' Guys, don't you see? Our friends need us, but we can only save them if we fight back. ''(Pulls Dipper up after her)''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel is right. Bill ''wants'' us to run and hide. He wants us to think he's invincible. But Ford told me before he was captured that he knows Bill's secret weakness.
|-
!
|''The refugees perk up and start muttering.''
|-
!Wendy
|Weakness?
|-
!Dipper
|Now, if we band together, if we combine all of our strength, our smarts, our...whatever Toby has...
|-
!Toby
|Various rashes!
|-
!Dipper
|...then we just might be able to rescue Ford, learn Bill's weakness, and save Gravity Falls!
|-
!
|''Everyone cheers.''
|-
!Stan
|Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Have you all forgotten who's in charge here? Besides, we're only safe inside! It's not like we can take the Mystery Shack to Bill.
|-
!McGucket
|Wha--Whoa! Holy hootenany! Flapjack and fiddlebanjos! Sorry, Sorry. Got a little excited. ''(Thumps his foot and slaps his knee'') What I meant to say is I think I figured out a way to fight Bill and rescue Ford. But we're all gonna have to work together. ''(Snaps his fingers and a gnome puts glasses on him)'' Now. You just...
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Soos, Wendy and McGucket
|''(Talk unintelligibly)''
|-
!Soos
|Don't worry, Ford! We're coming for you!
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill unfreezing Ford at the Fearamid.''
|-
!Ford
|Let me go, you insane three-sided--! Wha--What is this place? ''(Pulls at a chain on his leg)''
|-
!Bill
|''(Rises out of the floor, playing a piano and singing:)'' We'll meet again. Don't know where, don't know when. Oh, I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
|-
!Ford
|Wh-where am I?
|-
!Bill
|You're in the penthouse suite, kid! The tip of the pyramid. Have a drink. ''(Snaps his fingers and a martini glass appears in Ford's hand)'' Make yourself comfortable. ''(Takes a sip of his drink as Ford sits down)'' You know that couch is made from living human skin?
|-
!
|''The couch groans as eyes, a nose, and a mouth appear. Ford jumps up.''
|-
!Ford
|Aaah! Quit the games, Cipher! If I'm still alive you must want something from me.
|-
!Bill
|Ah, sharp as ever, Fordsy. As you may have noticed...I've recently had a ''(Voice echoing:)'' multi-dimensional makeover. ''(Stops echoing and rearranges the room's furniture)'' I control space, matter, and now that that dumb baby's out of the way, time itself! But I wasn't always this way. ''(Everything falls to the floor)''
|-
!Ford
|Ooph!
|-
!Bill
|You think those chains are tight? ''(Eye shows a planet on a two-dimensional plane, which burns)'' Imagine living in the second dimension, flat minds in a flat world with flat dreams. I liberated my dimension, Stanford, and I'm here to liberate yours. There's just one hitch. ''(Eye projects a hologram of him pushing against the dome around Gravity Falls)'' As it turns out, my weirdness can't escape the magical confines of this town. There's something keeping me in.
|-
!Ford
|Incredible! Gravity Falls natural law of weirdness magnetism. I studied this years ago!
|-
!Bill
|And did you find a way to undo it?
|-
!Ford
|Of course. There's a simple equation that could collapse the barrier. But I'd never tell you!
|-
!Bill
|Listen, Ford, if you just tell me that equation, finally your dimension will be free. ''(Projects himself drawing a smiley face in the midwest United States, then takes a bite out of the Earth and flies past his friends, who are destroying other planets, then to Ford, who is standing in the middle of a galaxy)'' Anything will be possible. I'll remake a fun world-- a better world! A party that never ends with a host that never dies! No more restrictions! No more laws! You'd be one of us. All-powerful. Greater than anything you've imagined! And all I need is your help.
|-
!Ford
|You're insane if you think I'll help you.
|-
!Bill
|Ha ha ha! I'm insane either way, brainiac. But have it your way. I'll just fish around and get that equation directly out of your mind! ''(Enters the mental realm)''
|-
!Ford
|Not so fast! You know the rules, Bill. You may be able to haunt my dreams but you can't enter my mind unless I shake your hand and let you in.
|-
!Bill
|''(Enters the physical realm and sighs, then chains Ford's legs and neck)'' You're making this so much harder than it needs to be. Everyone has a weakness, tough guy! I'll make you talk! It's only a matter of time.
|-
!Ford
|''(Screams)''
|-
!
|''Cut to the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!McGucket
|''(Lays out some blueprints)'' Alright. I've made some thingamadiculous robomajigs in my day, but this is the first one that ''won't'' be used for evil.
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa! These blueprints are incredible, McGucket.
|-
!Mabel
|This is your most amazing invention yet.
|-
!Soos
|Question, does it have any gun-swords? I watch a lot of anime and, uh, trust me, you're gonna want some gun-swords.
|-
!McGucket
|What's an "anime"?
|-
!Soos
|We have much to discuss.
|-
!Stan
|Discuss nothing! These scribbles are a bunch of cockamamie balderdash! Excuse my French.
|-
!French lilliputtian
|Je ne sais quoi sacrebleu au revoir! ''(Subtitled:)'' I don't believe that was French.
|-
!Stan
|And where would you even find a bunch of idiots who would be crazy enough to build it?
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan, you're looking at those idiots.
|-
!
|''Everyone cheers.''
|-
!Soos
|Idiots!
|-
!
|''Cut to montage of the refugees building the robot: McGucket points out the parts needed, then people raid the junkyard; cut to people taking stuff from inside the shack.''
|-
!Stan
|Whoa-what! What are you--? H-hey now! Hey hey! Don't touch that! Hey! Aah!
|-
!
|''Cut to people digging a dinosaur out from the [[Abandoned mines]]; Soos showing McGucket anime while the latter takes notes; cuts all the parts being put together and to a "Take Back the Falls" flag. Cut to everyone outside the Shack wearing [[List of Mabel's sweaters|Mabel's sweaters]].''
|-
!Soos
|Thanks for these apocalypse sweaters, Mabel. The end of the world has never been so comfortable.
|-
!
|''Some of the refugees nod and hum in agreement.''
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Shivers; Mabel glares at her)'' Uh! Fine, I'll wear it. ''(Puts on the llama sweater)'' But I'm not gonna like it.
|-
!Mabel
|Admit it. This is the best day of the end of the world. I think we actually have a chance to beat Bill and win back our future.
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah. Getting to actually ''live'' to see our 13th birthday party is the only birthday present I want right now.
|-
!Soos
|Hey, if we're lucky enough to get there, I guarantee this whole town is gonna throw you the best birthday party you've ever seen.
|-
!Dipper
|Thanks, Soos. Hey, has anyone seen Grunkle Stan?
|-
!Stan
|This whole plan is bonkers. But of course no one asked the chief what he thinks. After all I've done for everyone!
|-
!Shmebulock
|Shmebulock!
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, exactly, it's a total load of Shmebulock.
|-
!Mabel
|Is something wrong, Grunkle Stan? You're acting grunklier than usual.
|-
!Stan
|It's this darn plan to save my brother. If you didn't notice, I already saved him once from that [[Universe portal|portal]], and he never thanked me! He causes the end of the world, and somehow it's still always "Stan's the screw-up. Ford's the hero."
|-
!Dipper
|Well maybe people think he's a hero because he didn't want to hide in the Mystery Shack!
|-
!Stan
|Well maybe if he hid in the Mystery Shack, he wouldn't have been captured!
|-
!Mabel
|Guys! Guys! Trust me, tomorrow's gonna be great! I believe in us.
|-
!Chutzpar
|Help! Leader Mabel! I keep accidentally flexing through my sweater. ''(Does so)'' Augh! It happened again!
|-
!Mabel
|Those weird cow-monsters are delightful! Coming!
|-
!
|''Cut to the next morning. [[Gompers]] walks across a barren wasteland and bleats.''
|-
!McGucket
|Alright, fellas. Let's hope this turns out better than my other inventions.
|-
!Mabel
|Everybody ready? Dipper, now!
|-
!
|''Dipper pulls a lever, causing wheels to turn. Machinery begins running and the invention starts moving. As the invention stands up, the refugees are tossed side-to-side inside the Shack.''
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Bud Gleeful]] burning some [[Gideon Gleeful|Gideon]] dolls.''
|-
!Bud Gleeful
|Forgive me, boy. Your hyperflamable merchandise is the only thing keepin' me going. ''(As the robot walks past)'' What in blazes?
|-
!
|''The robot approaches the Fearamid.''
|-
!Ford
|No! No! Noooo!!
|-
!Bill
|''(Zaps him)''
|-
!Ford
|Aaaagh!
|-
!Bill
|Ready to talk now?
|-
!Ford
|''(Gasping)'' I won't. I won't let you into my mind.
|-
!Bill
|What do you think, pals? Another 500 volts? Hey, do you hear that?
|-
!
|''The robot's t-rex head crashes through the Fearamid and roars.''
|-
!Bill
|What?! I just fixed that door!
|-
!
|''The Mystery Shack robot comes into full view.''
|-
!Soos
|It's the Shacktron, dude! ''(Holds the Take Back the Falls flag, topped with Wax Larry King's head)''
|-
!Wax Larry King
|They made the house into a robot. Fascinating!
|-
!Bill
|So the mortals are trying to fight back, huh? Adorable! Henchmaniacs, you know what to do! Take them out!
|-
!
|''Bill's minions grow in size and jump out of the Fearamid to stand in front of the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Stan
|This was a bad idea.
|-
!Soos
|''(Through a microphone:)'' Uh, hey, dudes. Is this thing on? Test ''(Feedback screeches)'' Heh. Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes to hand over Ford or we'll have to, like, fight and junk. Heh. Hey, you're a little cutie.
|-
![[Paci-Fire]]
|I have butchered millions on countless moons.
|-
!Soos
|Whoa. I liked you better before you talked. Real... real bring down, this guy.
|-
![[Pyronica]]
|Attack!
|-
!
|''The demons run at the Shacktron.''
|-
!Soos
|All right, dudes! (''Runs into the Shack)''
|-
!Dipper
|Everyone! Like we planned! Three, two, one. Go!
|-
!Candy and Grenda
|''(Operate arms, punching away Paci-Fire and [[Kryptos]])''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Uses [[Waddles]]' mouth to pull a lever, which causes the Shacktron to shoot several demons away)'' Ha ha ha. Good pig.
|-
!Waddles
|''(Squeals)''
|-
!Eye Bats
|''(Attack the Shacktron)''
|-
!McGucket
|Get em, [[Gobblewonker robot|Gobblewonker]]! ''(Operates a Gobblewonker head on top of the Shacktron, grabbing an eye bat in its mouth)''
|-
!Rumble
|''(Kills two eye bats with fireballs)'' Hya! Hya!
|-
!Wendy
|Oh, no, you don't! ''(Jumps onto an eye bat and pulls its wings, turning [[8 Ball]]'s head to stone. Wendy jumps off the eye bat back into the shack)''
|-
!Multi-Bear
|Everyone! Incoming!
|-
!Stan
|''(Pulling at a door labeled "EXIT")'' Does this thing have an escape hatch?
|-
!
|''[[Zanthar]] rams the Shack and pushes it back. Everyone inside screams.''
|-
!Mabel
|Everybody! Maximum power!
|-
!Sev'ral Times
|''(Runs on a treadmill)''
|-
!Dipper
|And...now! ''(Turns a wheel and the Shacktron grabs Zanthar and throws it)''
|-
![[Teeth]]
|''(Runs away on fire, screaming)''
|-
!Bill
|Guys, seriously? You had, like, one job to do here.
|-
!Ford
|Bravo, Dipper and Mabel!
|-
!Bill
|Well, would you look at that. Those kids really care about you. And you care about them. ''(Eye turns red; deep voice:)'' Don't you?
|-
!Ford
|What are you....Oh. Oh no.
|-
!Bill
|Perhaps torturing those kids'll make you talk.
|-
!Ford
|No. No! Not the kids! You ca-

!Bill
|''(Turns Ford to gold)'' Let's get this over with. ''(Crawls outside, grows a giant fist and slams it down on the Shacktron; he raises his fist only to find the Shack perfectly fine)'' What the? No! No! No! No! No! ''(Grows ten arms and pounds at the Shack)''
|-
!Stan
|Ah!
|-
!Mabel
|ATTACK!
|-
!Grenda
|''(Punches, causing the T-rex head to lunge at Bill. It bites Bill's eye and pulls back, ripping his eye out.)''
|-
!Bill
|Aah! My eye! Do you have any idea how long it takes to regenerate that?!?
|-
!Dipper
|We've got him distracted. Now's our chance.
|-
!Mabel
|Rescue team, move out!
|-
!
|''Mabel puts her [[Mabel's grappling hook|grappling hook]] in her sweater. Soos puts the [[memory erasing gun]] in his backpack. Dipper tests the [[Height-altering crystals|height-altering crystal flashlight]] on a Mystery Shack snowglobe. Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Stan, Soos, Wendy, Pacifica and Sheriff Blubs standing in the exit tubes.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay everyone. We get in, rescue Ford, get out, save the world. Piece of cake.
|-
!Pacifica
|Just so we're clear. If I die, I'm suing all of you.
|-
!Stan
|Hey, on second thought, maybe we could come up with a plan that ''doesn't'' involve us plummeting to our certain death-
|-
!Wendy
|Now! ''(Presses a button and they are pulled up out of the tubes and shot out of the Gobblewonker's mouth, screaming. They fall towards the Fearamid's opening)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, man, oh, man...
|-
!Mabel
|''(Doing cartwheels through the air)'' WOOHOO! HAHAHA!
|-
!
|''They open their parachutes as they approach the Fearamid. They all land and remove their parachutes. All of them gasp upon seeing Bill's throne.''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, man. It looks even worse up close.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shoots her grappling hook, which lands on Manly Dan and pulls herself up to the throne)'' I found Great Uncle Ford! ''(Tosses the grappling hook down)'' He's golden. But not in the good way!
|-
!Stan
|Great! Grab him and let's get out of here.
|-
!Dipper
|But how are we going to unfreeze them?
|-
!Gideon
|''(Offscreen)'' I know! ''(Onscreen, dancing in a cage)''
|-
!Mabel
|Gideon! What happened to you?
|-
!Gideon
|Bill captured me. He's been forcing me to do cute dances in this cage for all eternity. ''(Sobbing)'' I'm so tired of being cute!
|-
!Dipper
|How do we undo this?
|-
!Gideon
|Mayor Tyler. He's the load-bearing human. Pull him out, and the whole thing goes down.
|-
!
|''Dipper pulls at Tyler's arm. He rattles before turning back to normal and breaking free. This sets off a chain reaction, causing the chair to collapse. As it does, the residents are returned to normal. Deputy Durland hits Gideon's cage, knocking it down and breaking it, freeing Gideon.''

![[Lazy Susan]]
|Ugh. My mouth tastes like nightmares.

|Don't you ever scare me like that again. ''(Hugs him)''
|-
!
|''Everyone claps and cheers.''
|-
!Ford
|''(Unfreezes)'' Kids! Ah, you did it! I knew I could count on you two. Haha! (''To McGucket:)'' Fiddleford. I--I haven't seen you since we parted ways. You must hate me.
|-
!McGucket
|I've tried forgettin'. Maybe I should try forgiving. Come here, old friend. ''(Hugs Ford)''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, good to see you too, bro. Now let's get outta here, huh?
|-
!Dipper
|Listen, Uncle Ford, we don't have a lot of time. Remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew Bill's weakness?
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?
|-
!Ford
|I--I do! ''(Pulls on gloves)'' Now, does anyone have a pen? Pencil? Anything? ''(Sees Robbie's spraypaint can)'' Ah. ''(Grabs the can)'' Perfect. ''(Draws with the spraypaint)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, we've got Bill outside, but I don't know how long we can keep him occupied.
|-
!Ford
|Yes, yes. Good, good.
|-
!Stan
|Drawing a circle on the floor. Well, he's lost his mind.
|-
!Ford
|My mind is fine. And there is a way to beat him. With this.
|-
!
|''Shot pulls back to show that Ford has drawn the [[Zodiac]].''
|-
!Pacifica
|The world's most confusing game of hopscotch?
|-
!Ford
|No, a prophecy. Although it would be a pretty fun game of hopscotch. ''(Cut to Ford as a young man in a cave approaching a painting of Bill's wheel. Voice-over from the present:)'' Many years ago I found ten symbols in a cave. Some I recognized then, some I only recognize now. The native people of Gravity Falls prophesied that these symbols could create a force strong enough to vanquish Bill. With Bill defeated, his weirdness would be reversed and the town could be saved. ''(Flashback ends)'' This whole time I thought it was just superstition. But seeing you all here now, I finally understand that it's destiny. Dipper, the pine tree. Mabel, the shooting star.
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Step on their respective spots)''
|-
!Soos
|The question mark. This one's unsolvable.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Pushes Robbie onto the broken heart symbol)'' That one's easy. You've been rockin' that dumb hoodie since the seventh grade.
|-
!Robbie
|Whoa. Destiny hoodie.
|-
!Dipper
|The [[Tent of Telepathy]] sign! That must be Gideon.
|-
!Gideon
|''(Stands on it)'' Whoo! An excuse to stand next to Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't turn this into a big deal.
|-
!Gideon
|Oh, I won't! ''(Whispering:'') I will.
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill with the Shacktron. It punches him and holds him to the ground.''
|-
!Bill
|''(Noticies the leg outside of the shield)'' What the... Hey, [[Wikipedia:Achilles|Achillles]]! Nice work with the HEEL! ''(Rips off the leg)'' FORE! ''(Hits the Shack with the leg and it rolls away)''
|-
!
|''Cut to inside the Fearamid.''
|-
!Ford
|Hold hands, everyone. This is a mystical human energy circuit.
|-
!Dipper
|Ice? Who's ice?
|-
!Ford
|The symbols needn't all be literal, Dipper. It just has to be someone cool in the face of danger.
|-
![[Lee]], [[Nate]], [[Tambry]], [[Thompson]]
|Wendy! Wendy!
|-
!Wendy
|Heheh. Shut up, you guys. ''(Stands on the ice bag symbol)''
|-
!Ford
|Much like the spectacles need to be someone scholarly.
|-
!McGucket
|(''Stands on the glasses symbol)'' Heeheh!
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Stands on the llama symbol and looks at the llama sweater she's wearing)'' This is freaky.
|-
!Ford
|Now hold hands, everyone.
|-
!McGucket
|''(Holds out his hand, which has flies around it, to Pacifica)''
|-
!Pacifica
|Ew! I'm not touching that.
|-
!Preston
|Do it, sweetie. Do the one thing no one in our family has ever done: touch the hillbilly.
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Holds McGucket's hand and everyone in the circle glows. Thunder rumbles and smoke circles around the Fearamid.)''
|-
!Dipper
|Great Uncle Ford! I think it's working!
|-
!McGucket
|Hoohoo! Heehahahaha!
|-
!Ford
|Yes! This is it! ''(To the people outside the circle:)'' The rest of you get out. It's too dangerous!
|-
!
|''The people not in the circle run away.''
|-
!Ford
|We just need one more person...Stanley! Stanley, get over here. You're the only one left.
|-
!Stan
|You realize this is a bunch of hogwash, right? You really think some caveman graffiti is gonna stop that monster?
|-
!Gideon
|Dang it, old man! Now's not the time!
|-
!Wendy
|Come on!
|-
!Pacifica
|What are you doing? You're gonna ruin this!
|-
!Robbie
|I've never held hands this long and I am ''very'' uncomfortable.
|-
!Stan
|Whoa. Hey. I'm not the enemy here, people. Don't forget who literally created the end of the world.
|-
!Ford
|I'm sorry, Stanley. I know. Just help me fix it. Please.
|-
!Stan
|Fine. Just do one thing. Say "thank you."
|-
!Ford
|What?
|-
!Stan
|I spent thirty years trying to bring you back into this dimension and you ''still'' haven't thanked me! You want me to shake your hand? Say "thank you."
|-
!Ford
|Fine. Thank you.
|-
!Stan
|''(Holds Ford's and Soos' hands)'' Now, see. Between me and him, I'm not always the bad twin.
|-
!Ford
|Between "him and me." ''(Beat)'' Grammar, Stanley.
|-
!Stan
|I'll "grammar Stanley" you! ''(Lets go of Soos' hand and hits Ford)'' You stuck up son of a gun! I mean come on!
|-
!Ford
|''(Lets go of Robbie's hand and hits Stanley)'' Don't jeopardize this, you idiot! Everything's on the line!
|-
!Mabel
|Guys, stop it!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel pull at Stan and Ford, who are fighting and yelling unintelligibly at each other.''
|-
!Dipper
|Join hands!
|-
!
|''Ford and Stan stop fighting as Bill approaches.''
|-
!Bill
|Oh no, it's Bill! Right? Isn't that what you're all thinking? Hey, Gideon, why aren't you dancing? Chop chop, huh?
|-
!
|''Cut to first end card.''
|-
!Bill
|Ha ha ha ho! This is just too perfect! Didn't you brainiacs know the zodiac doesn't work if you don't all hold hands? And what's better, you've brought every threat to my power together in one easy-to-destroy CIRCLE! ''(Burns the circle)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no!
|-
!Pacifica
|''(Notices that her hair is on fire and pats it)'' Ah! My hair!
|-
!Robbie
|''(Notices that his hair is on fire and pats it)'' Ah! My hair also!
|-
!Bill
|''(Grabs Stan and Ford)'' You guys wanna see what happens to your friends when you can't get along?
|-
!McGucket
|Hey! You give them back!
|-
!Gideon
|You've gone too far, Cipher!
|-
!Wendy
|Yeah! We're not scared of you! (''Grabs her ax)''
|-
!McGucket
|''(Grabs his banjo)''
|-
!Bill
|Oh, but you should be. ''(Snaps and everyone except Dipper, Mabel, Ford, and Stan floats up beside him)''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh no!
|-
!Bill
|You know, this castle could really use some decorATIONS! ''(The people who he was holding up are replaced by tapestries with pictures of them screaming in front of their symbols)'' Looks like it's too late for your friends, Stanford.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel scream as a cage encases them.''
|-
!Stan
|Ah! Kids!
|-
!Bill
|But you can still save your family. Last chance: tell me how to take Weirdmageddon global and I'll spare the kids!
|-
!Dipper
|No! Don't do it!
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah! Bill makes bad deals!
|-
!Bill
|Don't you toy with me, Shooting Star. I see EVERYTHI--! ''(Eye shows a picture of a galaxy; as Mabel sprays paint in his eye)'' Ow! Not again! Why?! Every time!
|-
!Stan
|Nice shot, pumpkin.
|-
!
|''Ford and Stan are released from Bill's arms and fall to the ground.''
|-
!Bill
|I just regenerated that eye!
|-
!Mabel
|I ''know'' that hurts because I've accidentally done it to myself! Multiple times!
|-
!
|''Dipper pulls out the height-altering crystal flashlight and enlarges their cage. Dipper and Mabel jump out as Bill continues to scream in pain.''
|-
!Dipper
|Save yourselves. Run! We'll take care of Bill!
|-
!Ford
|What? That's a suicide mission!
|-
!Dipper
|Trust us. We've beat him before...
|-
!Mabel
|...and we'll beat him again! (''Fist bumps Dipper'') Hey! Bill! Come and get us, you pointy jerk!
|-
!
|''Bill growls. Dipper and Mabel run off into the Fearamid. Before leaving, Mabel stretches her lips to blow a raspberry.''
|-
!Ford
|What? No! It's too dangerous!
|-
!
|''Ford and Stan start to run after Dipper and Mabel, but Bill puts them in a cage.''
|-
!Bill
|''(Opens eye)'' Not so fast. You two wait here! ''(Turns red and grows six arms)'' I've got some children I need to make into corpses. (''Deep voice:)'' Seeya real soon. ''(Runs off)''
|-
!Stan
|No! Wait! No! No! Oh, what do we do? What do we do?!
|-
!Ford
|''(Bangs on bars)'' Kids!
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel run through the Fearamid, with Bill chasing them.''
|-
!Bill
|When I get my hands on you kids, I'm gonna DISSASEMBLE YOUR MOLECULES! You've tricked me for the last time! ''(Tries to grab them, but they fly away on the grappling hook)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Ford and Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Oh, I can't believe this. The kids are gonna die and it's all my fault. Because I couldn't shake your stupid hand! Uh, [[Filbrick Pines|dad]] was right about me. I am a screw-up.
|-
!Ford
|Ah, don't blame yourself. I'm the one who made a deal with Bill in the first place. I fell for all his easy flattery. You would have seen him for the scam artist he is.
|-
!Stan
|How did things get so messed up between us?
|-
!Ford
|We used to be like Dipper and Mabel. The world's about to end and they still work together. How do they do it?
|-
!Stan
|Easy. They're kids. They don't know any better. ''(As Ford stands up)'' Whoa, where you goin'?
|-
!Ford
|I'm going to play the only card we have left. Let Bill into my mind. He'll be able to take over the galaxy and maybe even worse, but at least he ''might'' let the kids free.
|-
!Stan
|What?! Are you kiddin' me?! Are you honestly telling me there's nothing else we can do?!
|-
!Ford
|Bill's only weak in the mind space. If I didn't have this darn plate in my head we could just erase him with the memory gun when he steps inside my mind.
|-
!Stan
|What if he goes into ''my'' mind? My brain isn't good for anything.
|-
!Ford
|Heheh. There's nothing in your mind he wants. It ''has'' to be me. We need to take his deal. It's the only way he'll agree to save you and the kids.
|-
!Stan
|Do you really think he's gonna make good on that deal?
|-
!Ford
|What other choice do we have?
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel running through the Fearamid. They scream as they reach a dead end.''
|-
!Dipper
|You know, I'm starting to think there's no way out of here.
|-
!Mabel
|Like Grunkle Stan always says, when one door closes, choose a nearby wall and bash it in with brute force! ''(Grows her hand with the flashlight and punches through the wall)'' AHHH! ''(Shrinks her hand back to normal)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha! Now let's round up the townsfolk and together we can defeat...oh, no! (''Sees the rest of the refugees tied on the ground, guarded by the demons)''
|-
!Grenda
|You'll never take us alive, monsters!
|-
!Teeth
|That's fine with us! ''(Eats Shmebulock)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, no.
|-
!Bill
|Peeka-boo! (''Catches them in a tractor beam)''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Aaah!
|-
!Bill
|''(Re-enters the main room with Dipper and Mabel in his hand)'' Alright, Ford. Time's up. I've got the kids. I think I'm gonna kill one of 'em now just for the heck of it! EENIE..MEENIE...MINEE ''(Eye switches between the pine tree and shooting star symbol with each word, then ends on the shooting star)''...YOU!! ''(Holds up his other hand)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Wearing Ford's clothes and imitating Ford's voice)'' Wait! I surrender.
|-
!Bill
|Good choice. ''(Drops Dipper and Mabel)''
|-
!Ford
|''(Wearing Stan's clothes and imitating Stan's voice)'' Don't do it, Ford, it'll destroy the universe!!
|-
!Stan
|It's the only way.
|-
!Bill
|HAHAHAHA! Oh, even when you're about to die, you Pines twins just can't get along. ''(Drops the cage and ties up Ford)''
|-
!Stan
|My only condition is that you let my brother and the kids go!
|-
!Bill
|Fine.
|-
!Dipper
|No, Grunkle Ford! Don't trust him!
|-
!Bill
|It's a...DEAL! (''Holds Stan's hand, then enters the mental realm)'' Ahaha! Hahaha! AHAHAHAHAHA! ''(Enters Stan's mind)'' Oh, I'm here. I'm finally here! Look at this place: a perfect, calm, orderly void. Gotta hand it to ya, Ford. You really know how to clear your m-- ''(Opens the door to see Stan on his chair in the Mystery Shack's living room with a paddleball)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Makes a clicking sound and points a finger-gun at Bill)''
|-
!Bill
|''WHAT?!''
|-
!Stan
|Heh heh! Do a pretty good impression of my brother, don't I? Switch clothes and no one can tell us apart. Welcome to my mind. Surprised you didn't recognize it.
|-
!
|''Outside of Stan's mind, Ford takes off Stan's fez and pulls out the memory erasing gun. He enters "Stanley Pines" and aims it at his brother. Cut back to Stan's mind.''
|-
!Bill
|WHAT?! The deal's off!! ''(Turns around but the door shuts)'' What the...No, no, no, no!
|-
!
|''The room starts to burn with blue fire.''
|-
!Stan
|Oh yeah. You're going down, Bill. You're gettin' erased. Memory gun. Pretty clever, huh?
|-
!Bill
|Y-you idiot! Don't you realize you're destroying your own mind, too?!
|-
!Stan
|Eh. It's not like I was using this space for much, anyway.
|-
!Bill
|Let me outta here! Let me OUT! ''(grunts)'' Why isn't this working?!
|-
!Stan
|Hey, look at me. Turn around and look at me, you one-eyed demon! You're a real wise-guy, but you made one fatal mistake: you messed with my family.
|-
!Bill
|You're making a mistake! I'll give you anything! ''(Eye shows a picture of a dollar sign, a star, a pot of gold and a galaxy)'' Money! Fame! Riches! Infinite power! Your own galaxy! Please! ''(Bends and melts)'' No! What's happening to me?! ''(Flashes between several distorted forms;speaking backwards:)'' Nruter yam I taht rewop tneicna eht ekovni i! Nrub ot emoc sah emit ym! L-T-O-L-O-X-A! ''(Speaking normally:)'' STAAANNLLEEEEY!
|-
!Stan
|''(Punches Bill in the eye and Bill disintegrates with a fading scream. Stan pants, then picks up a picture of him with Dipper, Mabel and Waddles) ''Heh. Guess I was good for something after all.
|-
!
|''The flames engulf him. Cut to outside of Stan's mind. Once Ford finishes erasing Stan's memory he drops the memory erasing gun. The others from the wheel return to normal and drop to the floor. Outside of the Fearamid, the rift sucks all of the demons back into the [[Nightmare Realm]] through the portal. Teeth spits out Shmebulock as he gets pulled away.''
|-
![[The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity]]
|Hey! Hey!
|-
!
|''The Fearamid is deconstructed and pulled into the rift. Once it is gone, a wave washes over the town, restoring it to its pre-Weirdmageddon state. The townsfolk look around, and [[Xyler and Craz|Xyler, Craz]] and Rumble McSkirmish all fade away. The forest is shown with a bird landing on a statue of Bill, covered in moss and vegetation. Cut to another part of the forest with Stan still collapsed on the ground. He opens his eyes.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Runs up to Stan and puts his fez on him)'' Oh, my gosh! Grunkle Stan, you did it!
|-
!Stan
|Oh, uh, hey there...kiddo. What's your name?
|-
!Mabel
|Eheh. Grunkle Stan?
|-
!Stan
|Heh. ''(Looks around)'' Who you talkin' to?
|-
!Mabel
|C-cmon. It's me. It's me, Grunkle Stan. ''(As Dipper pulls her back)'' Grunkle Stan, it's me!
|-
!Ford
|We had to erase his mind to defeat Bill. It's all gone. Stan has no idea, but he did it. He saved the world. He saved me. ''(Kneels down next to Stan)'' You're our hero, Stanley. ''(Hugs him)''
|-
!
|''Mabel sits down and cries. Dipper puts his hand on her shoulder and cries as well. Cut to everyone in front of the Mystery Shack, which is laying in a heap in the woods. They walk up to the door. Dipper punches the door until it comes down. Everyone walks into the living room, Dipper and Mabel holding Stan's hands.''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, this is a real nice place you got here.
|-
!Dipper
|It's ''your'' place, Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't you remember? Even a little?
|-
!Stan
|''(Sitting down in the recliner)'' Nope. But this chair hugs my butt like it remembers. Ah. ''(Looks at everyone else, who are looking at him sadly)'' Hey, why the long faces? You guys look like it's someone's funeral. ''(Whispering:)'' Who's that big guy crying in the corner?
|-
!Soos
|''(Sobs and turns away)''
|-
!Dipper
|We saved the world, but what's the point? Grunkle Stan's not himself anymore.
|-
!Mabel
|There's ''gotta'' be ''something'' we can do to jog his memory.
|-
!Ford
|There isn't. I'm sorry. Stan's gone.
|-
!Mabel
|I ''know'' my Grunkle is in there somewhere. There's gotta be something around here that can help bring him back. ''(Grabs her scrapbook, sits next to Stan in the recliner and opens it)'' This'll work! This has to work! Here's the first day we came to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan. And here's a macaroni interpretation of my emotions. ''(Flips through the pages)''

!Dipper
|That [[The Legend of the Gobblewonker|time we went fishing]]? That [[Summerween]] we spent together? Don't you remember anything?

|What did you say?
|-
!Stan
|I said get ''Waddles'' off of me.

!Soos
|Skip to my page! He needs to remember our boss-employee relationship.

|Hey, just cuz I have amnesia, don't go tryin' to give yourself a raise, Soos. ''(Sits in the chair)''
|-
!Dipper
|It's happening! Keep going!
|-
!Mabel
|Okay. Okay. "Day two. Grunkle Stan smells weird but we're starting to bond. He told us a lot about being a business man in the '80s and seemed happy when we pretended to listen. He also gave me a grappling hook which everyone is impressed by. And in more important news, I met some neighborhood hotties." ''(Laughs)''

But other than that, I can safely say our beloved Gravity Falls is back to normal. And now, Bodacious T, with sports.
|-
!Toby Determined
|''(Holding a skull and bat)'' It's called, "death ball."
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel standing in front of a cake with many townsfolk.''
|-
!Crowd
|''(Singing:)'' [[wikipedia:Happy Birthday to You|...to you.]] ''(Cheers)''
|-
!Mabel
|I can't believe you all got together just to throw a party for us.
|-
!Tyler
|After all the Pines family has done for the town, it's the least we could do. You've helped everyone here.
|-
!Gideon
|Thanks to y'all savin' us, I'm gonna learn to open my heart to kindness. No more evil-doin'. From now on, I'm gonna try to be Li'l Gideon, regular ol' kid.
|-
!
|''Cut to Gideon at a park on a skateboard.''
|-
!Gideon
|Wa--oh! Woo! I'm bustin' a move on this skatin' board.
|-
!Boy
|''(Walking past Gideon)'' More like busting your pants, loser. ''(Laughs)''
|-
!
|''Gideon looks over at [[Ghost-Eyes]] and [[Killbone]] on the teeter-totter. He snaps his fingers and the two go after the boy. Offscreen, they beat him up and the boy screams. Gideon giggles. Cut back to the party.''
|-
!Soos
|Dude! Make a wish, dawg.
|-
!Dipper
|You know, on my first day here, if you had asked me what I wanted, I would have said, "adventure, mystery, true friends." But looking here at all of you I realize that every wish came true. ''(Chuckles)'' I have everything I wanted.
|-
!Mabel
|If I had only one wish it would be to shrink all of you with the shrink ray and bring you home with us in my pocket. But since that's impossible... ''(To Ford:)'' Is that impossible?
|-
!Ford
|''(Waves his hand up and down and shrugs)''
|-
!Mabel
|Since that's ''probably'' impossible, my only wish is for everyone to sign my scrapbook. I'll never forget you guys. Wait. (''Sets the memory gun on the floor and smashes it'') ''Now'' I'll never forget you guys. (''She and Dipper blow out the candles'')
|-
!Wendy
|''(Hugs them)'' I now officially declare you technically teenagers. Welcome to angst and acne forever.
|-
!Wendy, Tambry, Robbie, Lee, Nate and Thompson
|One of us! One of us!
|-
!Blubs and Durland
|WOOPEE! ''(Fire a cannon)''
|-
!Soos
|So how do you feel?
|-
!Mabel
|Same-y, but different-y.
|-
!Pacifica
|Hey, you two. When are you gonna open your presents already? I broke a nail wrapping them.
|-
!Mabel
|''(She and Dipper laugh)'' Pacifica.
|-
!
|''Dipper and Mabel each grab a present. Stan claps.''
|-
!Ford
|Stanley, I need to talk to you. ''(Leads him behind the shack)'' I didn't wanna say anything with everyone listening, but we've got a problem. Weirdmageddon has been contained but I'm detecting some strange new anomalies near the arctic ocean. ''(Shows a holographic map of the world on his watch)'' I want to go investigate it but I think I might be too old to go it alone.
|-
!Stan
|Are you sayin' you need someone to help you sail around the world in the adventure of a lifetime?
|-
!Ford
|I don't just want ''someone'' to come with me Stanley, I want it to be you. ''(Gives him a photo of them as kids posing on the Stan-o-War)'' Will you give me a second chance?
|-
!Stan
|You think we'll find treasure? And babes?
|-
!Ford
|Heh! I'd say there's a high probability. But, what should we do with the Mystery Shack?
|-
!Stan
|I think the town's had enough mystery for one lifetime. Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
|-
!
|''Stan and Ford start talking unintelligibly. Soos walks up behind them, eating cake, and gasps when he overhears their conversation. Cut to Stan and Ford on the porch with Dipper and Mabel.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Tapping a Pitt cola bottle)'' Everyone, I have an announcement to make. Me and my...heh!... nerdy bro over here have some catchin' up to do. We're gonna be away for a while. That's why I'm shutting down the Mystery Shack for good.
|-
!Crowd
|''(Gasp and murmur)''
|-
!Soos
|You shut down your ''mouth'' for good! ''(beat)'' I'm sorry, Mr. Pines. It's just that this shack is the most magical place on Earth. Sure, the attractions are all fake, but dreams aren't fake! ''(Holds up a fiji mermaid taxidermy)'' Like, this mermaid. It's not just a dead fish butt sewn to a monkey carcass. It's a marvelous creature that makes us believe that anything is possible. You shut down this shack, and you shut down our dreams! At least...my dreams.
|-
!Crowd
|Aww.
|-
!Stan
|''(Sighs)'' I'm sorry, Soos. It's just, there's no one around to run it. At least, there ''wouldn't'' be if I hadn't just found the perfect replacement. ''(Puts his fez on Soos)'' Ladies and gentleman, the Mystery Shack is under new management.
|-
!Crowd
|''(Cheers)''
|-
!Soos
|You...you mean it, Mr. Mystery?
|-
!Stan
|You're Mr. Mystery now, Soos. Try not to burn the place down.
|-
![[Abuelita]]
|''(Carrying luggage and assorted items, with a 'Movers' truck in tow)'' I'll move in immediately.
|-
!
|''The partygoers keep cheering. Cut to the Mystery Shack later that evening. The screen shows the empty attic. Cut to the Pines, Soos, Wendy, Candy, Grenda and Waddles at the bus stop.''
|-
!Candy
|Do you really have to go? There's still so much we haven't done together.
|-
!Mabel
|Summer's over, Candy. It's time for us to grow up.
|-
!Dipper
|But not too much.
|-
!Grenda
|Aaah! I hate my dumb heart for making me feel things. ''(Punches herself)'' Cut. It. Out. Heart!
|-
!Soos
|Hey, can you punch my heart, too?
|-
!Candy
|No, mine! Punch ''my'' feelings away.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Hugs Candy and Grenda)'' Candy and Grenda, thank you for being my people. You'll always be my best friends. Grunkle Stan, thanks for wearing my goodbye sweater.
|-
!Stan
|Ah, it's cold out. I had to.
|-
!Soos
|What? But it's like eighty-something degrees out today.
|-
!Stan and Ford
|Can it, Soos!
|-
!
|''Dipper, Mabel, Candy and Grenda laugh.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Kneels next to Dipper)'' Hey, you mean a lot to me, man.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Fist-bumps Wendy)'' You, too.
|-
!Wendy
|''(Switches hats with Dipper)'' Something to remember me by. ''(Handing Dipper a letter)'' Oh, and this. Read it the next time you miss Gravity Falls.
|-
!
|''A bus pulls up.''
|-
![[Bus Driver]]
|Last bus leaving Gravity Falls. All aboard.
|-
!Mabel
|Guess we've said goodbye to everyone except...Waddles. I...I don't know how to explain this but... ''(sighs)'' [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|Mom and Dad]] won't let me bring a pig home to California so... you have to stay here!
|-
!Waddles
|''(Pulls Mabel's skirt)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Trying to push Waddles off of her; starts to cry)'' Come on. Come on. I have to go. I'm...I'm sorry, Waddles.
|-
!Stan
|Agh! You know what? Forget it! I lived with this pig all summer, now ''your'' parents are gonna have to. ''(Puts Waddles on the bus)'' Hey, bus guy! This pig is comin' with the kids.
|-
!Bus Driver
|Now, hold on a second. Bringing animals aboard a moving vehicle is strictly prohibited by--
|-
!
|''Stan pulls out his brass knuckles and Ford shows his gun.''
|-
!Bus Driver
|Wah...w-w-welcome aboard. You can sit in the front row, pig.
|-
!Stan
|Kids, you knuckleheads were nothin' but a nuisance and I'm glad to be rid of ya.
|-
!Mabel
|''(She and Dipper hug him)'' We'll miss you too, Grunkle Stan.
|-
!Dipper
|Ready to head into the unknown?
|-
!Mabel
|Nope. Let's do it.
|-
!
|''They get on the bus and it drives away. Everyone runs after the bus shouting their farewells.''
|-
!Mabel
|Bye! Bye, everybody! We'll miss you.
|-
!Dipper
|Bye! I'll miss you guys, too!
|-
!
|''Ford puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' If you've ever taken a road trip through the Pacific Northwest, you've probably seen a bumper sticker for a place called Gravity Falls.
|-
!
|''Cut to McGucket walking into the Northwest Manor. He drops his sack and banjo on the ground.''
|-
!McGucket
|Well, I've moved in.
|-
!Dipper
|It's not on any maps, and most people have never heard of it. Some people think it's a myth. But if you're curious, don't wait.
|-
!
|''At the Mystery Shack, Soos unveils a statue of Stan. The kids run away screaming. Cut to Ford and Stan on a boat. A giant squid attacks them and Stan punches it. Cut to Dipper and Mabel on the bus and Mabel is asleep.''
|-
!Dipper
|Take a trip. Find it. It's out there somewhere in the woods. Waiting. ''(Opens the letter, which has signatures from various people and says "See you next summer."; Dipper smiles)''
|-
!
|''We then see the scrolling closing credits in the form of Mabel's scrapbook with various pictures such as Waddles playing with the bubble; Dipper and Mabel setting off firecrackers; Mabel doing crazy poses while taking a selfie such as blowing a dandelion and "eating" a sun; Wendy makes a "crazy face" in front of the camera; [[Dipper clones]] #3 and #4 relaxing under the tent during the rain; Stan trying out the grappling hook while holding Ford; Mabel painting Ford's fingers; Old Man McGucket, his raccoon wife, and his son [[Tate McGucket|Tate]] relaxing in the pool; [[Quentin Trembley]] looking yonder at Gravity Falls while sitting on his horse backwards; Mabel, Grenda and Candy doing quick poses in a photo booth; the Pines family watching TV and then fall asleep the next day; some objects in the Mystery Shack like the antique diving helmet and the jar of eyeballs; a tree shows a number of heart carvings with one of them saying Mabel+[[Gabe Bensen|Gabe]], possibly about Mabel's ex-boyfriends; a snack bar in the Mystery Shack where a kid takes one cookie bag; Grenda and Candy during the final days of summer traveling in the yacht with [[Marius von Fundshauser]] when Grenda vigorously kisses him; and the final picture before the credits end shows Dipper and Mabel with Waddles sleeping in the bus seat as they reach their hometown of Piedmont, California. ''

''Before the series ends with the last end card, there is a live action shot of Bill's petrified statue hidden in the woods.<nowiki/>''
