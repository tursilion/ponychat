Time's up!
Pass it over, Jasper.
Guess that makes me the winner.
Pay up.
You could always try winning it back!
All right, suit yourself.
It passes the time.
Do you play?
Is that so?
You think you can beat me?
Big talk for a little pony.
Whatever you're bettin', it better be special.
Izzy, if your friend is finished stalling, do we have a deal?
No, no, no, no, no.
A special prize calls for a special competition.
Bring forth the ultimate challenge!
Let's make this more interesting.
You only need to win one out of three.
That's how you do it!
I'll make this quick.
Critters, get my crystal polish ready, would ya?
An Earth pony.
Help? We don't need help.
Especially from ponies like you.
Give me the crystal.
You tricked me.
You'll pay for this!
Give me back my crystals and leave Bridlewood!
Not anymore, it doesn't!
I won it fair and square!
You Pegasi always thought you were better than us!
Surrender the crystal, or I'll use my powers against you!
You're wasting your time, kid.
Izzy Moonbow, you're gonna get us all jinxed!
Come back to Bridlewood!
Hi there, buddy.
